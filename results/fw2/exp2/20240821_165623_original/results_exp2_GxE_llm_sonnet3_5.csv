POLR3A-related spastic ataxia,D,POLR3A-related spastic ataxia,"The clinical and radiological findings were consistent with POLR3A-related spastic ataxia and exome sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous POLR3A mutation (c.2000T>A [p.Leu667*]/c.1909 + 22G>A). The first variant (p.Leu667*) has not been previously reported but causes a loss of function and is therefore considered likely pathogenic. The second (intronic) mutation (c.1909 + 22G>A) causes a cryptic splice site, leading to the production of both wild-type and aberrant transcripts. It is considered pathogenic based on cosegregation data and predicts a more benign phenotype.1POLR3A-related spastic ataxia is an autosomal recessively inherited disease. While diffuse hypomyelination/leukodystrophy has originally been described as the classic radiological finding, this does not seem to be obligate for all POLR3A-related disorders.2 The cardinal features of the spastic ataxia subtype are typically adolescent-onset progressive gait abnormality and teeth deformities.1 Panoramic dental radiography (Figure 2) for this patient corroborated the absence of several teeth, microdontia, interdental spacing, and a rectangular shape of several teeth known as “taurodontia,” caused by enlarged pulp chambers. Common radiographic features include spinal cord atrophy, mild atrophy of cerebellum and corpus callosum, and hyperintensity of the superior cerebellar peduncles.3,4 Compound heterozygous POLR3A mutations have been identified in 3% of patients who present with otherwise genetically unexplained spastic paraplegia and cerebellar ataxia.1,5Panoramic dental radiography showing the absence of several elements, microdontia, and taurodontia.POLR3A mutations have been linked to other genetic syndromes, including 4H leukodystrophy (consisting of hypomyelination, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and hypodontia) and Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome, a recognizable neonatal syndrome causing premature aging.3 The phenotypic differences between these disorders are thought to arise from the different functional effects of underlying POLR3A mutations.3Hereditary spastic paraplegia type 7 (SPG7) is an alternative diagnosis that should be considered. SPG7 presents as spastic ataxia or isolated cerebellar ataxia. Likely pathogenic mutations in the SPG7 gene are found in 18.6% of patients with unexplained ataxia, making it one of the most common genetic causes. MRI for patients with SPG7 demonstrates cerebellar atrophy and sometimes atrophy of the medial and lateral rectus muscle.6 Although ataxia and pyramidal signs are the most common clinical features, a more complex phenotype does occur with neuro-ophthalmological findings like nystagmus, partial ophthalmoparesis, slow saccades, or optic neuropathy.6 This was not seen in this patient. To the best of our knowledge, hypodontia has not been described in SPG7, making it a less probable diagnosis.Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay is an uncommon heredodegenerative disease characterized by early-onset ataxia associated with spasticity. Brain MRI shows cerebellar vermis atrophy and linear T2-hypointensities in the pons.7 The disease is associated with variable degrees of peripheral neuropathy, pes cavus, and retinal fiber hypertrophy that is almost pathognomonic and was not seen in this patient.Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common and thus the most important alternative diagnosis. FRDA has a typical onset before age 25 years. It manifests as a spastic ataxia with pes cavus, cardiac problems, and variable loss of reflexes.8 MRI of the spinal cord looks similar to POLR3A.7,9 Therefore, distinguishing between POLR3A and FRDA often relies heavily on accompanying clinical signs and genetic testing. In a large cohort of 650 patients with genetically confirmed FRDA, the most frequent clinical features beyond ataxia were abnormal eye movements (90.5%), scoliosis (73.5%), deformities of the feet (58.8%), urinary dysfunction (42.8%), and cardiomyopathy and cardiac hypertrophy (40.3%), followed by decreased visual acuity (36.8%).10 These were not present in this patient. Additionally, genetic testing for FRDA was negative, with less than 27 GAA repeats on both alleles of the FXN gene.In summary, POLR3A-related spastic ataxia is a not-so-rare autosomal recessively inherited disease with spastic/ataxic gait and hypodontia as the main clinical features.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate diagnosis for this case is Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS). This conclusion is based on several key clinical and radiological features presented in the case:

1. Age of onset: The symptoms started in childhood, which is consistent with ARSACS, typically manifesting before age 5.

2. Progressive gait instability: This is a hallmark feature of ARSACS.

3. Neurological findings: The patient exhibits a combination of cerebellar ataxia (truncal and appendicular ataxia), spasticity (left-sided spasticity, hyperreflexia), and peripheral neuropathy (impaired joint position sense in toes), which are characteristic of ARSACS.

4. Dental abnormalities: Hypodontia and microdontia are reported, which can be associated with ARSACS.

5. MRI findings: The most striking and specific finding for ARSACS is the marked spinal cord atrophy, which is prominently mentioned in this case. Additionally, the isolated hyperintensity of the superior cerebellar peduncles and atrophy of the corpus callosum isthmus are also consistent with ARSACS.

6. Absence of family history: ARSACS is an autosomal recessive condition, which explains the lack of family history in this case.

While some features might overlap with other conditions mentioned in the options, the combination of early-onset progressive ataxia, spasticity, and the characteristic MRI findings (especially the marked spinal cord atrophy) strongly point towards ARSACS as the most likely diagnosis among the given options.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Surgical exploration for possible debridement (option C) would not be the preferred answer because the CT did not show signs of gas-forming bacteria (ie, fascial thickening, fat stranding, and abscess formation). Magnetic resonance imaging (option D) would not be necessary as a next step as there was no indication to further characterize the emphysema, and the diagnosis was made clinically with supportive information from the CT scan.Further questioning after the CT revealed that the patient had chronic sinusitis, which she managed by blowing her nose. The patient explained that her swelling seemed to worsen after clearing her nose, suggesting that the emphysema was likely linked to her nose blowing. Given her persistent symptoms and pain with extraocular eye movement, however, the presence of an allergic and/or infectious component could not be fully ruled out. The patient commenced loratadine treatment to manage any allergic component contributing to her emphysema, as well as erythromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate to manage any cellulitis component (option B). She was discharged home with instructions to use cold compresses and lubricating drops to manage her symptoms. Close follow-up was arranged, and instructions were provided to seek emergency medical care if she developed signs suggestive of an infection (ie, fever, warmth, erythema, or worsening pain).Subcutaneous emphysema is a rare but known complication associated with dacryocystorhinostomy.1-3 The connection that is made between the nasal mucosa and the lacrimal sac creates a susceptibility for forced air to become trapped within the subcutaneous tissues. This likely occurs due to disruption in the mucosal barrier following the procedure, which can act as a one-way valve to trap air. It may also be more likely with more anterior bone removal creating a plane to the subcutaneous tissues of the eyelids. While most cases tend to be self-limiting in nature,3 there are important exceptions to be aware of. The spread of air can involve the orbits,4-7 which can raise the intraorbital pressure and pose immediate risk to the optic nerve, which requires emergency decompression when present.7 In extreme scenarios, subcutaneous emphysema can extend to the chest wall, posing risk for airway compromise and tension pneumomediastinum.2 Lastly, subcutaneous emphysema can mimic necrotizing fasciitis.1 Surgical procedures introduce the risk for postoperative infection, with rates of cellulitis after external dacryocystorhinostomy estimated to be between 1.2% and 7.9% based on whether systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is used or not.8 When cellulitis occurs, it introduces the potential for gas-producing organisms to spread rapidly and cause necrosis of subcutaneous tissue.9 If necrotizing fasciitis is suspected based on fitting clinical symptoms and supporting investigations (ie, elevated white blood cell count, low serum sodium concentration, and positive cultures), treatment warrants aggressive debridement of necrotic tissue, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and possible hyperbaric oxygen therapy.9,10The patient returned for follow-up on the fifth postoperative day, where her emphysema was continuing to improve. The patient made a full recovery within 2 weeks and did not require further follow-up with ophthalmology. Unfortunately, the patient had an allergic reaction during her second postoperative week, suspected to be linked to the course of antibiotics prescribed, resulting in a return to the emergency department for management of her symptoms.",Ophthalmology,2024-04-01,2024,4,"A 67-year-old woman underwent an elective left external dacryocystorhinostomy to treat her symptomatic nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate course of action in this case is to consider empirical antibiotics and manage the patient's symptoms expectantly. Here's why:

1. Clinical presentation: The patient has developed cervicofacial swelling, ecchymoses, and crepitus following a dacryocystorhinostomy. These symptoms, along with the CT findings of extensive emphysema, are consistent with surgical emphysema, a known complication of this procedure.

2. Absence of severe complications: Despite the dramatic appearance, there are no signs of severe complications such as orbital compartment syndrome, vision loss, or infection. The patient's visual acuity is only slightly reduced, extraocular movements are intact, and there's no relative afferent pupillary defect.

3. Timing: The symptoms have been present since the first postoperative day, suggesting they are directly related to the surgery rather than a new, acute process.

4. Imaging findings: The CT scan shows extensive emphysema but normal globes, extraocular muscles, and optic nerves, indicating that there's no immediate threat to vision or orbital structures.

5. Conservative management: Surgical emphysema following dacryocystorhinostomy often resolves spontaneously with conservative management. Empirical antibiotics can help prevent potential infection in the affected tissues.

6. Risks of intervention: More invasive options like surgical exploration or needle decompression carry risks of introducing infection or causing further tissue damage, and are not necessary given the current clinical picture.

7. Monitoring: While managing symptoms expectantly, the patient can be closely monitored for any signs of worsening, which would prompt more aggressive intervention if needed.

This approach allows for the natural resolution of the emphysema while preventing potential complications, avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures, and ensuring patient comfort and safety.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

She noted a sudden vision loss in her left eye 3 days prior to presentation. Her Snellen visual acuity on presentation was 20/20 OD and 20/200 OS, and intraocular pressure was normal in both eyes. Anterior segment examination revealed shallowing of the anterior chamber in the left eye. Posterior examination results demonstrated a retinal detachment in the posterior pole with shifting fluid and no identifiable retinal break (Figure 1A). No vitreous cell was noted. Findings of imaging testing were notable for thickened choroid with a hyporeflective band on ultrasound biomicroscopy (Figure 1B).A, Serous retinal detachment in the left eye. B, Ultrasound biomicroscopy of the left eye showed a thickened choroid and a hypoechogenic band in the area of choriocapillaris congestion (asterisk).She had a medical history of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (World Health Organization group 1 pulmonary hypertension) and was currently undergoing evaluation for a bilateral lung transplant. She was currently taking macitentan, an endothelial receptor antagonist; subcutaneous treprostinil, a continuous prostanoid infusion; and riociguat, a guanylate cyclase stimulator. She noted increased dyspnea, exertional hypoxemia, and peripheral edema in the preceding weeks; her diuretic therapy was adjusted and oxygen therapy was added.

Ocular manifestations occur as a result of increased systemic vascular pressure, with distention of the internal jugular vein, cavernous sinus, and ophthalmic veins leading to increased episcleral venous pressure (EVP).1 Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension accounts for about 10% of all cases of PAH, and most ocular complications are associated with this subtype.2 Medical management attempts to restore vascular homeostasis. Multiple drug classes are used, including phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists, guanylate cyclase, prostaglandins, diuretics, and oxygen. Lung transplant is considered for appropriate patients who are worsening despite maximal medical therapies.This patient presented with serous retinal detachments. In PAH, increased systemic venous pressure leads to increased hydrostatic pressure in the choroid and choriocapillaris, leading to occlusion of the choriocapillaris blood flow.  Ocular manifestations include uveal effusion, choroidal detachment, exudative retinal detachment, and retinal vein occlusion. Glaucoma has also been reported as a rare complication due to angle-closure glaucoma, neovascular glaucoma, and elevated EVP.3-8Aggressive management of PAH and right heart failure is the mainstay for treatment of ocular manifestations along with intraocular pressure–lowering medications. Surgical repair of exudative retinal detachments is not indicated and can lead to iatrogenic complications (option A). Early studies of eplerenone (option D) for treatment of CSCR showed promising results, but further randomized clinical trials demonstrated no benefit of eplerenone.9 While VKH can be considered in this patient and treated with prednisone, the lack of intraocular inflammation makes this diagnosis highly unlikely. Oral steroids (option B) would have been the treatment choice in a patient with VKH, but the lack of other features of VKH, including anterior chamber cells and vitreous cells, makes this diagnosis less likely.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to work with a pulmonary hypertension specialist to optimize the patient's pulmonary hypertension management. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical case:

1. Underlying condition: The patient has idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO group 1), which is likely the root cause of her ocular symptoms.

2. Recent systemic deterioration: The patient reported increased dyspnea, exertional hypoxemia, and peripheral edema in recent weeks, indicating worsening of her pulmonary hypertension.

3. Cardiac findings: Echocardiography showed severe pulmonary hypertension and severe right ventricular dysfunction, which are critical issues that need immediate attention.

4. Ocular symptoms: The retinal detachment is likely secondary to her systemic condition. In pulmonary hypertension, increased venous pressure can lead to choroidal effusion and subsequent serous retinal detachment.

5. Risks of surgical intervention: Performing a pars plana vitrectomy (option C) in a patient with severe cardiopulmonary disease carries significant risks and may not address the underlying cause of the retinal detachment.

By optimizing the management of pulmonary hypertension first, we can potentially improve both the systemic condition and the ocular symptoms. This approach addresses the root cause rather than just treating the ocular manifestation. Once the pulmonary hypertension is better controlled, the retinal detachment may resolve spontaneously, or if surgical intervention is still needed, it can be performed under safer conditions.

The other options (B and D) are less appropriate as they do not directly address the underlying pulmonary hypertension, which is the likely cause of both the systemic and ocular symptoms in this case.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Given no intraocular inflammation or response to oral steroids, choice C is unlikely to be of benefit. A diagnosis of uveal effusion syndrome (UES) was made, in which it is hypothesized that abnormal scleral thickness and/or composition decreases transscleral protein outflow and can compress vortex veins, leading to fluid accumulation in the choroidal and subretinal spaces.1 Performing scleral windows surgery (choice D), which involves partial-thickness scleral excision in multiple quadrants, can improve transscleral outflow and help resolve the exudative RD.1UES is a rare condition characterized by serous ciliochoroidal and RD associated with shifting subretinal fluid and leopard spotting.1 UES has been classified into type 1, nanopththalmic eyes; type 2, non-nanophthalmic eyes with clinically abnormal sclera (defined by abnormal scleral thickness or histology); and type 3, non-nanophthalmic eyes with clinically normal sclera.1,2 In a case series of 106 eyes from 66 Asian patients diagnosed with UES, the mean (SD) patient age was 35.9 (12.2) years for type 1 UES and 44.7 (8.2) years for type 2 UES. Fifty percent of affected patients were male.3 UES in older individuals is uncommon, and this patient adds to the small number of published cases described in individuals 70 years or older.4-6UES is a diagnosis of exclusion. Bullous central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) can present with shifting subretinal fluid and may mimic UES. Unlike UES, CSCR is associated with retinal pigment epithelium detachments, and steroid administration can exacerbate bullous CSCR.7 Lack of inflammation or pain differentiates UES from inflammatory disorders such as posterior scleritis. Hypotony and medication adverse effects can mimic UES, but these did not apply to this patient. UES can be mistaken for choroidal melanoma or other neoplasm, but reassuring features for UES can include nonpigmented choroidal detachment often extending 360°, absence of orange pigment, lack of transillumination shadow, and absence of intrinsic vasculature on B-scan ultrasonography.1 Bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation is usually bilateral and tends to have red-orange lesions that are associated with hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography and hypoautofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence, in contrast to this patient’s findings.8Although some authors have reported improvement of UES with steroids, acetazolamide, or latanoprost, surgery is often indicated for vision-threatening cases.6,9 Scleral windows are typically created in 2 or more quadrants,2 and serial follow-up initially at least every couple months is indicated to assess for RD resolution and possible recurrence.10 Surgical management may be more effective for types 1 and 2 than type 3 UES.2This patient underwent partial-thickness scleral windows in all 4 quadrants. Intraoperatively, the sclera was abnormally thick, suggestive of type 2 UES.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform scleral windows surgery (option C). This decision is based on several key factors from the case:

1. Uveal effusion syndrome: The patient presents with a combination of serous choroidal detachments, retinal detachment with shifting fluid, and 360° ciliochoroidal effusion. These findings are consistent with uveal effusion syndrome, a rare condition often associated with nanophthalmos or thick sclera.

2. Normal axial length: Despite the presentation, the patient has a normal axial length (24.32 mm OS), which rules out nanophthalmos. This suggests that the uveal effusion may be due to impaired trans-scleral outflow.

3. Failed steroid treatment: The patient did not respond to a trial of high-dose oral prednisone, indicating that inflammation is unlikely to be the primary cause.

4. Absence of retinal breaks: No retinal breaks were identified on scleral depressed examination, making a primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment less likely.

5. Negative systemic workup: The absence of systemic findings or inflammatory markers suggests a localized ocular problem.

Scleral windows surgery is the treatment of choice for uveal effusion syndrome, especially in cases with normal axial length. This procedure involves creating partial-thickness scleral windows or sclerectomies to enhance trans-scleral outflow of fluid from the suprachoroidal space. This approach addresses the underlying pathophysiology of impaired fluid outflow through the sclera, which is likely causing the choroidal and retinal detachments in this case.

The other options are less appropriate:
A. Pars plana vitrectomy: Not indicated as there's no evidence of vitreoretinal traction or primary retinal breaks.
B. Intravitreal steroid trial: Unlikely to be effective given the failure of systemic steroids and the absence of inflammatory signs.
D. Scleral buckle with cryotherapy: Not appropriate as there are no retinal breaks to treat, and it doesn't address the underlying uveal effusion.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

What Would You Do Next?",Wide local excision,Excision with frozen sections,Mohs surgery,Metastatic workup,Mucinous carcinoma of the eyelid,D,Metastatic workup,"Cutaneous mucinous carcinoma is a rare, low-grade malignant neoplasm of the sweat glands. It often presents as a slow-growing asymptomatic nodule, most commonly on the eyelid and the face.1 The histogenesis is disputed; while previously thought to be of eccrine origin, recent evidence suggests it demonstrates apocrine-type differentiation.2 Particularly on the eyelid, it may arise from endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma. Due to its low incidence, literature on this disease is limited.Most commonly, cutaneous mucinous carcinoma presents as a primary lesion but 5% to 6% are metastatic in origin.1,3 In metastatic disease, common sites of tumor origin include the breast and gastrointestinal tract. Thus, once a diagnosis of mucinous carcinoma is made, it is critical to evaluate for metastatic disease with full-body imaging (choice D).4,5 After metastatic workup is completed, a treatment plan can be determined. In this case, wide local resection (choice A) is not the preferred next step as systemic disease should first be ruled out. Similarly, excision with frozen sections (choice B) would not be recommended before evaluating for metastatic disease. Mohs surgery (choice C) would also not be preferred until a systemic workup is complete. After ruling out systemic disease, treatment of mucinous carcinoma is complete excision. Evidence suggests a lower rate of recurrence in patients undergoing excision with frozen section margins or Mohs surgery than wide local excision, as the extent of the tumor can be difficult to gauge clinically due to its infiltrative nature and the grossly normal appearance and texture of involved tissues.6The incidence of distant metastasis in cutaneous mucinous carcinoma is significantly higher in eyelid tumors than other primary anatomic sites.1,3 In addition, eyelid involvement has been shown to have higher rates of recurrence of up to 30% to 40%.6-8 In a large population-based study of 411 cases, there were 10 deaths reported due to primary cutaneous mucinous carcinoma; however, only 1 eyelid tumor was associated with death.3 Because of the high recurrence rate and possibly devastating outcomes, patients with primary cutaneous mucinous carcinoma should be monitored closely. Given the benign appearance of the tumor, ophthalmologists should take extra care when evaluating eyelid lesions with cystic features to not miss disease with metastatic potential. Fortunately, despite the higher incidence of distant metastasis and recurrence, eyelid tumors have not been found to be associated with worse survival.3After the initial biopsy confirmed mucinous carcinoma with positive margins, the patient underwent metastatic workup with a computed tomography of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which were unrevealing. He then underwent a full-thickness wedge resection of the entire visibly involved area with additional 2-mm margins of normal-appearing tissue medially, laterally, and inferiorly. These specimens were sent for rush permanent pathology. Surprisingly, all the margins returned positive. The patient returned for excision with frozen sections.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and histopathological findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a metastatic workup (Option B). Here's why:

1. Histopathology results: The biopsy revealed features consistent with either a primary endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma or a metastatic mucinous carcinoma of breast origin. This finding raises the possibility of metastatic disease, which needs to be ruled out before proceeding with definitive local treatment.

2. Immunohistochemistry: The positive staining for estrogen and progesterone receptors, along with variable staining for neuroendocrine markers (INSM1 and synaptophysin), supports the possibility of a breast origin for this lesion.

3. Tumor margins: The initial biopsy showed tumor present at the margin, indicating incomplete excision. However, before planning further local excision, it's crucial to determine if this is a primary or metastatic lesion.

4. Patient history: Although the patient has no known history of cancer, the slow growth over three years and the histopathological findings warrant a thorough investigation to rule out an occult primary malignancy, particularly breast cancer.

5. Treatment planning: The choice of definitive treatment (wide local excision, Mohs surgery, or systemic therapy) will depend on whether this is a primary or metastatic lesion. A metastatic workup will guide the most appropriate management strategy.

A metastatic workup may include breast imaging (mammography, ultrasound, or MRI), chest imaging, and possibly PET-CT to evaluate for a primary tumor or other metastatic sites. Once the extent of disease is determined, a multidisciplinary approach involving dermatology, oncology, and possibly breast surgery can be employed to plan the most appropriate treatment course.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Please analyze the following clinical case and the related question:

<clinical_case>
A 62-year-old male was referred for evaluation of a painless right lower-eyelid lesion noted during routine glaucoma follow-up. The lesion had been present for 3 years with slow, gradual enlargement. The patient denied any associated symptoms. He was a former smoker and had no history of skin cancer or immunosuppression. The remainder of his medical history was noncontributory.Inspection of the right lower eyelid revealed a cystic-appearing nodule that transilluminated and had a few overlying telangiectasias. The cystic portion was continuous with a deeper, smooth subcutaneous component that was well defined, firm, and nonmobile, with a total lesion length of 1 cm (Figure 1A). There was no madarosis, eyelid margin effacement or preauricular lymphadenopathy. Although no overt features of malignancy were present, the deeper component was atypical for a hidrocystoma and an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathologic evaluation showed a neoplasm composed of low-grade round nuclei growing in a micropapillary pattern within pools of extracellular mucin (Figure 1B). There was tumor present at the margin. Immunostains were positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. Variable staining for INSM1, a sensitive nuclear stain for neuroendocrine differentiation, and focal staining for synaptophysin, another neuroendocrine marker, were also seen. This immunophenotype is consistent with a primary tumor derived from endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma or a metastatic mucinous carcinoma of breast origin.Cystic-appearing subcutaneous nodule with a few overlying telangiectasias measuring approximately 1 cm identified just below the eyelash line (A).

Here's why:\n\n1. Histopathology results: The biopsy revealed features consistent with either a primary endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma or a metastatic mucinous carcinoma of breast origin. This finding raises the possibility of metastatic disease, which needs to be ruled out before proceeding with definitive local treatment.\n\n2. Immunohistochemistry: The positive staining for estrogen and progesterone receptors, along with variable staining for neuroendocrine markers (INSM1 and synaptophysin), supports the possibility of a breast origin for this lesion.\n\n3. Tumor margins: The initial biopsy showed tumor present at the margin, indicating incomplete excision. However, before planning further local excision, it's crucial to determine if this is a primary or metastatic lesion.\n\n4. Patient history: Although the patient has no known history of cancer, the slow growth over three years and the histopathological findings warrant a thorough investigation to rule out an occult primary malignancy, particularly breast cancer.\n\n5. Treatment planning: The choice of definitive treatment (wide local excision, Mohs surgery, or systemic therapy) will depend on whether this is a primary or metastatic lesion. A metastatic workup will guide the most appropriate management strategy.\n\nA metastatic workup may include breast imaging (mammography, ultrasound, or MRI), chest imaging, and possibly PET-CT to evaluate for a primary tumor or other metastatic sites. Once the extent of disease is determined, a multidisciplinary approach involving dermatology, oncology, and possibly breast surgery can be employed to plan the most appropriate treatment course."" response_metadata={'id': 'msg_vrtx_01E1wec4pth2gwoXkoCqndFD', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 758, 'output_tokens': 419}} id='run-4c036992-e18b-4fa5-ac06-f62b8bc1215d-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 758, 'output_tokens': 419, 'total_tokens': 1177}",0.0

IgG4-related disease,C,IgG4-related disease,"This case illustrates the diagnostic considerations of a patient with enlarged extraocular muscles. Although this most commonly occurs in thyroid eye disease, the patient was euthyroid and did not have the typical restrictive pattern of ocular dysmotility, whereby duction in the opposite direction of the enlarged muscle is impaired.1 Thyroid orbitopathy classically affects a combination of the inferior rectus, medial rectus, and/or levator palpebrae superioris.2 Isolated involvement of the lateral rectus, superior rectus, or oblique muscles is virtually absent in thyroid disease.2 Ocular lymphoma involving the extraocular muscles is rare, with 1 review identifying 46 cases in the literature3; it more commonly affects the lacrimal glands or the intraconal or extraconal orbital compartment. Ocular lymphoma can cause weakness of the enlarged extraocular muscles, whereas metastatic deposits result in a restrictive pattern.1 Features of malignancy include the presence of a focal mass, irregular edges, or nodularity within the muscle.2 Although single muscle involvement is often seen in idiopathic inflammatory orbital myositis, the lack of pain argues against the diagnosis. IgG4-related disease is well documented to involve extraocular muscles, commonly producing a restrictive pattern.4 IgG4-related disease can affect both the muscle belly and its tendinous attachment, whereas thyroid orbitopathy typically spares the tendon.2 Notably, the lateral rectus is disproportionately involved in patients with singular or multiple muscle involvement.2 Biopsy of the affected lateral rectus muscle revealed a diagnosis of IgG4-related disease, ruling out other such considerations as metastatic disease, giant cell myositis, sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and amyloidosis (Figure 2).Stain of the right lateral rectus muscle demonstrating lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates (arrowhead) and several IgG4-stained cells. Bar = 100 μm; hematoxylin-eosin.IgG4-related disease is an insidious, progressive, multisystem fibroinflammatory disease that can affect hepatobiliary ducts, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, salivary glands, retroperitoneum, pancreas, and lymph nodes, among other areas.5 Its prevalence is estimated at 0.28 to 1.08 per 100 000 individuals,5 with a mean age at diagnosis in the late 50s.6 Although IgG4-related disease is slightly more prevalent in men (1:0.64-0.77), IgG4-related orbital disease (IgG4-ROD) affects men and women equally.6 IgG4-ROD most commonly affects the lacrimal gland but can also affect extraocular muscles, orbit, adnexal soft tissue, and the cavernous sinus.6 Other neurological involvement includes hypertrophic pachymeningitis, hypophysitis, peripheral neuropathy, and parenchymal disease.6Although not well understood, the pathogenesis of IgG4-related disease involves complex immunogenic interactions between B cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes within the affected organ, leading to release of local cytokines that produce an irregular, whorled pattern of fibrosis (“storiform fibrosis”) at the site of disease.5,6 Within a germinal center of a lymph node or other lymphoid tissue, B cells also undergo preferential production of IgG4, and T helper cells facilitate class switching to IgG4.5,6 In a healthy adult, IgG4 comprises less than 5% of the body’s immunoglobulins.7 Elevated IgG4 levels above 135 mg/L support a diagnosis of IgG4-related disease, but this may be normal in 30% of patients.7Most patients with IgG4-ROD present with bilateral eyelid swelling and proptosis; however, diplopia is the presenting feature in one-third of patients.6 IgG4-ROD results in a lesser degree of restrictive strabismus and diplopia than thyroid orbitopathy, despite having greater extraocular enlargement.4 MRI may demonstrate a well-defined tumorlike mass within the structures of the orbit and/or abnormal thickening of extraocular muscles. The regions of abnormality are isointense on T1, have variable patterns of T2 signal change, and homogenously enhance on postgadolinium images.8 Enlargement of the infraorbital nerve on MRI is a specific sign for IgG4-ROD but lacks sensitivity.9 Involvement of the infraorbital nerve is minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic, as infiltration is typically limited to the epineurium.4 In the absence of reliable serological and radiographical markers, the diagnosis of IgG4-ROD hinges on histopathological confirmation of lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with an increased ratio of IgG4-positive to IgG-positive plasmacytes equal to or greater than 40%, or more than 50 IgG4-positive cells per high-power field.10 The classic findings of storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis in IgG4-related disease are less frequently seen in IgG4-ROD compared with other sites of disease.10Early recognition and treatment can prevent long-term complications and death in patients with IgG4-related disease. On confirmation of IgG4-ROD, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and rituximab should be initiated. Although systemic IgG4-related disease may be treated with corticosteroid monotherapy, combination therapy of corticosteroids and rituximab is preferred in patients with severe disease, neurological involvement, and high IgG4 levels.6",Neurology,2024-01-01,2024,1,"A 60-year-old man presented with a 1-week history of progressive painless diplopia.

[Explanation]
The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Idiopathic inflammatory orbital myositis. This conclusion is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Acute onset: The patient presented with a 1-week history of progressive painless diplopia, which is consistent with the typically acute or subacute onset of orbital myositis.

2. Isolated muscle involvement: The MRI shows abnormal thickening and enhancement of only the right lateral rectus muscle. Orbital myositis typically affects one or a few extraocular muscles, unlike thyroid orbitopathy which usually involves multiple muscles bilaterally.

3. MRI findings: The described ""abnormal thickening and T2 hyperintensity of the right lateral rectus muscle with T1-weighted gadolinium enhancement"" is characteristic of orbital myositis.

4. Exclusion of other causes: The negative tests for infection and autoimmune disease, as well as the absence of systemic symptoms or evidence of malignancy, support an idiopathic inflammatory process.

5. Absence of thyroid orbitopathy features: Despite the patient's history of hypothyroidism, the unilateral and isolated muscle involvement is not typical of thyroid orbitopathy, which usually presents with bilateral involvement and often affects multiple muscles.

6. No systemic symptoms suggestive of IgG4-related disease or lymphoma: The localized nature of the symptoms and the absence of constitutional symptoms make these diagnoses less likely.

While the other options are possible causes of orbital inflammation, the clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case are most consistent with idiopathic inflammatory orbital myositis.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency,D,Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency,"Motor developmental disorders in infancy and early childhood indicated cerebral palsy (CP). CP-associated movement disorders include spasticity, ataxia, and involuntary movements, often accompanied by sensory, cognitive, communicative, epileptic, and musculoskeletal problems.1 CP screening should be prioritized in case of a family history of no genetic diseases.Diagnosing neurogenetic disorders in adulthood is a crucial first step. Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by spasticity resulting from length-dependent damage to upper motor neurons. SPAST mutations (SPG4) are the most common cause of familial and sporadic HSP. Typically, SPG4 presents with a pure HSP phenotype, but its age at onset and severity are extremely variable. Early-onset SPG4 presents as complex HSP, with symptoms of motor and speech delays, progressive ascending spasms, dystonia, epilepsy, and autonomic dysmotility (neurogenic bladder, gastrointestinal dyskinesia).2,3 This patient exhibited developmental abnormalities of movement and speech without signs of upper motor neuron lesions, and genetic testing did not reveal any HSP genes.Early-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT16) is an autosomal recessive, progressive, generalized dystonia accompanied by levodopa-naive parkinsonism. It starts in a single limb and gradually extends to the entire body, involving the central axial, orofacial, and pharyngeal muscles. DYT16 mostly starts in childhood, with delayed developmental motor and speech milestones.4 This patient with dystonia and developmental delay had symptoms remarkably similar to DYT16; however, parkinsonism was not evident, and she exhibited hypersensitivity to low-dose levodopa. Additionally, no DYT16 gene was identified.Two heterozygous mutations in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene (c.739G>A; c.1071_1112del) were identified, confirming tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (THD), an autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder characterized by dopa-responsive dystonia, a group of dystonia syndromes resulting from impaired dopamine synthesis in the brain. TH is a key enzyme in dopamine synthesis, and TH gene mutations lead to impaired dopamine synthesis. Based on neurological features, THD can be divided into 2 types: type A, which is a progressive, hypokinetic-rigid syndrome with dystonia starting from infancy, and type B, progressive complex infantile encephalopathy, which presents with notable delayed or regressed motor development, feeding difficulties, hypotonia/hypertonia, and seizures.5 Genetic testing can most reliably establish THD, other than that which is primarily diagnosed based on the symptoms and dramatic therapeutic response to low-dose levodopa. Increased serum prolactin and decreased homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in cerebrospinal fluid are suggestive of THD.6,7 In this patient, galactorrhea and hyperprolactinemia supported the diagnosis. Unfortunately, a lumbar puncture could not be performed due to scoliosis. There were no specific findings with brain MRI. In similar cases, previous MRI studies have demonstrated mild-moderate cerebral and/or cerebellar atrophy and mild white matter signal changes, but without abnormalities in the basal ganglia.5,8 MRI exhibited extensive atrophy of the cerebral cortex and subcortex, cerebellum, and especially in the frontal lobe and anterior and lateral temporal lobes bilaterally. This finding was markedly different from the earlier studies.Levodopa is first-line treatment for THD. Patients with type A THD demonstrate marked improvement with levodopa administration while those with type B THD demonstrate hypersensitivity, resulting in levodopa-induced hyperkinesia.5,9 Therefore, initially, patients should receive a low dose of levodopa split over 4 to 6 doses per day. Even so, some patients with type B THD are still unable to tolerate levodopa therapy. This patient was given a starting dose of levodopa, 50 mg (three times a day), which rapidly relieved muscle tone. However, she concurrently generated levodopa-induced hyperkinesia, which improved after halving the dose.This case highlights the clinical presentation of THD and the importance of a levodopa trial and genetic testing in any patient presenting with dystonia and a regression in motor development since childhood.",Neurology,2023-11-01,2023,11,"A 31-year-old woman was evaluated for generalized dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, severe scoliosis, and motor development disorder that began in her childhood.

[Explanation]
The clinical presentation strongly suggests early-onset dystonia-parkinsonism, also known as DYT/PARK-GCH1 or Segawa syndrome. This diagnosis is supported by several key features in the case:

1. Early onset: The patient's symptoms began in childhood, with motor development issues starting at 10 months of age.

2. Dystonia: The patient presents with generalized dystonia, a hallmark of this condition.

3. Parkinsonism features: Hypertonia, dysarthria, and dysphagia are consistent with parkinsonian symptoms.

4. Diurnal fluctuation: While not explicitly stated, the mention of episodes of painful spasms suggests possible diurnal fluctuation, which is characteristic of this disorder.

5. Response to levodopa: The patient's quick response to levodopa treatment, albeit with induced hyperkinesia, is typical of DYT/PARK-GCH1.

6. Progressive nature: The symptoms worsened with age, leading to wheelchair use and speech difficulties.

7. Family history: The presence of a younger brother with similar symptoms suggests a genetic component, which is consistent with the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of DYT/PARK-GCH1.

8. Additional symptoms: Scoliosis and galactorrhea (likely due to hyperprolactinemia) are also reported in some cases of this disorder.

While cerebral palsy might be considered due to early onset, it typically doesn't progress or have a genetic component. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia don't fully match the clinical picture, particularly the dystonia and response to levodopa.

The combination of early-onset dystonia, parkinsonism features, family history, and response to levodopa strongly supports the diagnosis of early-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT/PARK-GCH1).","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

MRI findings have remained stable over the past 2 years with no progression of disease or worsening symptoms.Same magnetic resonance image as in Figure 1B with an arrowhead denoting asymmetric enhancement of the right maxillary nerve in the foramen rotundum.The onset of multiple cranial neuropathies presents a diagnostic dilemma. Oncological diagnosis is often difficult in the absence of an obvious lesion and normal or equivocal imaging.1 This can lead to diagnostic delays and worse outcomes. This patient was seen by 20 different physicians over 5 years, including general, autonomic, and neuromuscular neurologists and neuro-ophthalmologists, before a diagnosis of malignancy was made. It can take time for perineural invasion (PNI) to become radiographically apparent, and a high index of suspicion for underlying malignancy must be maintained even with initially negative imaging.Primary leptomeningeal lymphoma (A) is a rare manifestation of primary central nervous system lymphoma that can present with multiple cranial neuropathies.2 CSF results are usually abnormal and progression of symptoms more rapid.2 Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (B) can present with painful ophthalmoplegia and multiple cranial neuropathies; however, steroids are typically effective.3 When located along the sphenoid wing, meningiomas (D) can cause multiple progressive cranial neuropathies.4 Typically visible on MRI as extra-axial homogenously enhancing masses,4 no such lesion was observed here. In this patient, the symptomatology, history, and radiographic findings are best explained by PNI of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), which a biopsy confirmed.One of the most common cancers in the world, cSCC occurs frequently in the head and neck secondary to sun exposure.5 PNI refers to the process of tumor spread into nerves and the space surrounding them.6 An estimated 2% to 6% of patients with cSCC of the head and neck will have PNI.1,6 Cranial nerves V and VII are most commonly involved given their extensive anatomical distributions.1,5,6 Clinically or radiographically apparent PNI confers a poor prognosis with a reported 5-year absolute survival rate of 50%.5Treatment for cSCC of the head and neck includes surgery (if resectable) and high-dose radiotherapy and systemic therapy as appropriate. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition is being used with increasing frequency and notable effectiveness.5-9 Early-phase studies demonstrated impressive response rates near 50% for advanced, unresectable, and metastatic cSCC of the head and neck, earning US Food and Drug Administration approval for 2 checkpoint inhibitors in this setting.7,8 Recently, a landmark phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant cemiplimab for stage II through IV (M0) cSCC before surgery was published, with 51% complete pathological response rates and 68% objective response rates on imaging.9 Similarly, in a recent report of 11 patients with cSCC of the head and neck with clinical PNI treated with checkpoint inhibitors, radiographic disease control was observed in 9 of 11 patients at extended follow-up.5 Many of these responses are durable and curative.The presence of both CN V and VII symptoms in a patient with a history of head and neck cSCC should raise suspicion for perineural recurrence of disease. While initial MRI may be negative, radiographic manifestation of PNI often occurs over time as the disease progresses and symptoms worsen. Expert review by a neuroradiologist can be helpful in identifying this finding earlier in the disease course.

[Explanation]
The most likely diagnosis for this patient is perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy (Option A). This conclusion is based on several key factors from the clinical case:

1. Patient history: The patient has a significant history of cutaneous malignancies, including a left cheek melanoma and numerous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the head and neck. This history puts him at risk for perineural spread of these skin cancers.

2. Symptom progression: The patient's symptoms began with facial numbness and progressed over 5 years to include facial weakness, vision changes, and headaches. This slow, progressive course is characteristic of perineural spread.

3. Cranial nerve involvement: The patient exhibits symptoms affecting multiple cranial nerves (CN V, VI, VII), which is consistent with perineural spread along these nerve pathways.

4. Imaging findings: While initial MRIs were unremarkable, this is not uncommon in early stages of perineural spread. The fact that symptoms progressed over 5 years suggests that more recent imaging (Figure 1, which we cannot see) might show changes consistent with perineural spread.

5. Negative workup for other causes: Tests for infection and autoimmune disease were negative, and CSF studies only showed mildly elevated protein, which can be seen in perineural spread but is not specific.

6. Non-diagnostic biopsy: The biopsy of CN VII was non-diagnostic, which doesn't rule out perineural spread, as these can be challenging to diagnose on biopsy.

The other options are less likely:
- Sphenoid wing meningioma (B) typically presents with unilateral proptosis and visual impairment but wouldn't explain the extensive cranial nerve involvement.
- Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (C) usually presents with orbital pain and ophthalmoplegia but tends to respond well to steroids, which this patient did not.
- Primary leptomeningeal lymphoma (D) typically has a more rapid progression and would likely show more significant CSF abnormalities.

Given the patient's history of skin cancers and the pattern of slowly progressive, multiple cranial nerve involvement, perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy is the most appropriate diagnosis.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Iris tumors are predominantly characterized as solid (79% of cases) or cystic (21% of cases).1 Solid tumors include melanocytic lesions, with the 3 most common being benign iris nevus (60%), iris melanoma (26%), and iris freckle (4%).1,2 Cystic iris tumors are subclassified based on their tissue layer of origin, arising from either the iris stroma or iris pigment epithelium (IPE). Iris stromal cysts appear translucent, located on the anterior iris surface and with smooth lobulated surface, typically in young children.1,2 By contrast, IPE cysts appear on the posterior iris surface with brown or black color simulating solid melanocytic tumors, such as iris melanoma or IPE adenoma.1,2 For this reason, some IPE cysts have historically been mistaken for melanoma, even leading to enucleation. As iris melanoma is malignant with risk for metastasis, proper treatment for life protection with consideration of the potential for ocular adverse sequelae should be realized. Differentiation of the various iris tumors is paramount to management.Ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior-segment optical coherence tomography are useful tools in assessing the internal quality of iris tumors and differentiation of solid from cystic tumors.3 These technologies are critical for defining tumor basal dimension and thickness to monitor change over time or response to treatment. In this patient, slitlamp biomicroscopy (Figure) demonstrated the gravitational shifting of the mass (Video), and both ultrasound biomicroscopy (Figure, inset) and anterior-segment optical coherence tomography documented the mass to be cystic with no internal fluid or solid component. The Video demonstrates the superior-to-inferior descent of an IPE cyst across the visual axis, coursing purely through the aqueous humor with gravity, offering insight into the dynamic behavior of this lesion.Slitlamp biomicroscopy of the left eye showing a round, pigmented lesion in the inferior anterior chamber angle abutting the corneal endothelium and resting on the iris stroma measuring 3 × 3 mm in basal dimension. Inset, Ultrasound biomicroscopy scan of the free-floating cyst showing central lucency, no fluid level, and no solid component.Free-floating IPE cysts occur when the cyst becomes separated from the IPE, speculated to occur following ocular trauma, as in this patient.4,5 These free-floating IPE cysts are benign and rarely cause endothelial decompensation or visual sequelae.2,5 Fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics (choice A) was not appropriate because the lesion in question was not solid or within the iris, so iris melanoma was not likely. Iodine 125 plaque radiotherapy (choice B) was not appropriate, as this was a cystic, benign mass that was unlikely to be malignant. Cyst paracentesis with complete drainage (choice D) was not necessary in this case because the cyst did not affect the visual axis and was visually asymptomatic. Additionally, drainage of a free-floating cyst without any portion anchored to the iris would likely prove to be technically difficult.In summary, free-floating IPE cysts are benign epithelial cysts that can dislodge into the aqueous or vitreous following trauma, as in this patient. This form of cyst is benign and rarely leads to adverse sequelae; therefore, conservative observation is advised.This patient was counseled on the benign nature of the free-floating IPE cyst and advised to follow up in 12 months for repeated examination with imaging.

Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate course of action is to observe the lesion without additional testing or intervention (Option A).

The key factors supporting this decision are:

1. Asymptomatic nature: The patient is described as having an ""asymptomatic, pigmented iris lesion,"" indicating that it's not causing any visual disturbances or discomfort.

2. Normal visual acuity and intraocular pressure: The patient's best-corrected visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes, and intraocular pressures are normal, suggesting that the lesion is not affecting visual function or causing secondary glaucoma.

3. Characteristics of the lesion: The lesion is described as round, pigmented, and shows gravitational shifting within the anterior chamber fluid. This behavior is consistent with a benign iris cyst rather than a solid tumor.

4. Imaging findings: Both anterior segment optical coherence tomography and ultrasound biomicroscopy confirm that the lesion is cystic, with no internal fluid level or solid component. This further supports the diagnosis of a benign iris cyst.

5. No corneal involvement: There is no corneal guttatae or edema, indicating that the cyst is not causing damage to the corneal endothelium.

6. Normal fundus examination: The dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in both eyes, suggesting no posterior segment involvement.

Given these factors, the lesion is most likely a benign iris cyst, possibly resulting from the previous sports-related blunt trauma. Benign iris cysts typically do not require intervention unless they cause complications such as visual obstruction, angle closure, or corneal decompensation, none of which are present in this case.

Observation (Option A) is the safest and most appropriate approach, avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures that carry risks and are not indicated for an asymptomatic, benign-appearing lesion.

TSC is a phacomatosis with neurocutaneous manifestations characterized by multiple tumors of the embryonic ectoderm involving skin, eyes, and nervous systems.1 Hamartomas of the retina are part of the major features for the diagnosis of TSC.2The clinical diagnostic criteria for TSC include 11 major and 7 minor features. Major features are 3 or more hypomelanotic macules at least 5 mm in diameter, 3 or more angiofibromas or fibrous cephalic plaques, 2 or more ungual fibromas, shagreen patch (a large nevus with irregular, firm plaquelike features typical of TSC), multiple retinal hamartomas, multiple cortical tubers or radial migration lines, 2 or more subependymal nodules, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, cardiac rhabdomyoma, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and 2 or more angiomyolipomas. Minor features of TSC are 1- to 2-mm hypomelanotic macules, also known as confetti skin lesions; 3 or more dental enamel pits; 2 or more intraoral fibromas; retinal achromic patch; multiple renal cysts; nonrenal hamartomas; and sclerotic bone lesions.The diagnostic certainty of TSC depends on the number of major and minor features. Definite TSC requires 2 major features or 1 major and 2 or more minor features. Possible TSC requires either 1 major feature or 2 or more minor features.3 Genetic testing is also available, and the identification of either a TSC1 or TSC2 pathogenic variant from nonlesional tissue is sufficient to make a definite diagnosis of TSC regardless of clinical findings.3History should be obtained and focused physical examination is recommended for skin and the central nervous system. The association between TSC and astrocytic hamartoma can be observed in up to half of patients with TSC.2 There are several phenotypes of astrocytic hamartoma associated with TSC, including slow-growing flat lesions (similar to that observed in this patient), as well as more aggressive, rapidly growing tumors that can lead to enucleation.2 Histology shows that astrocytic hamartomas are composed of glial astrocytes and blood vessels with hyaline and calcium deposits.4If TSC is suspected, the primary concern must be initiating the systemic workup with neuroimaging (choice B), as the central nervous system manifestations of TSC can be life threatening. Secondarily, treatment for the ophthalmic complications of the disease can be considered, such as with anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications for secondary exudation (choice A).5 Retinal hamartomas are not typically associated with a hypercoagulable state or cardiac concerns (choices C and D).The patient was referred for neuroimaging, which revealed multiple subcortical tubers and lateral ventricle subependymomas consistent with the diagnosis of TSC. Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic variant in the TSC1 gene labeled c.733C>T(p.R245*), which is most commonly a de novo variant. Excisional biopsy of the facial lesion was consistent with angiofibroma, a benign cutaneous hamartoma frequently found in tuberous sclerosis complex. Because the central nervous system lesions were asymptomatic, the patient was referred for annual imaging and observation in pediatric neurology.Retinal hamartomas are classified into 3 morphological subtypes. Type 1 AHR is the most common and is characterized by flat and smooth lesions semitransparent without calcifications. Type 2 AHR lesions are raised, multinodular, opaque, and with calcification. Type 3 AHR lesions are transitional lesions with features of types 1 and 2.6Treatment of AHR lesions is determined on a case-by-case basis. Photodynamic therapy, laser, radiation, and anti-VEGF have been described.7 Due to the secondary exudation and hemorrhages consistent with a small branch retinal vein occlusion with edema affecting the central macula, we performed a systemic hypercoagulable workup, which was unrevealing. Because the exudation affected the central macula, we started treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF to treat the macular edema. Two years later, the patient was stable with visual acuity 20/25 in the affected eye but has required monthly treatment with worsening edema and vision with an attempted treat-and-extend strategy.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to order brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for associated central nervous system tumors.

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings strongly suggest tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of benign tumors in various organs, including the brain, eyes, skin, and kidneys. The key features supporting this diagnosis include:

1. Retinal findings: The presence of a retinal astrocytic hamartoma, as evidenced by the macular whitening, abnormal vessels, and OCT findings.
2. Skin manifestations: The exophytic, brownish-red vascular papule on the cheek (likely an angiofibroma), lightly pigmented patches of skin (possibly ash-leaf spots), and subungual fibromas on the toes.

Given the high likelihood of TSC, it is crucial to evaluate for central nervous system involvement, which is common in this condition. Brain MRI can detect various CNS manifestations of TSC, including:

1. Cortical tubers
2. Subependymal nodules
3. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs)

Early detection of these lesions is important for appropriate management and prevention of complications such as seizures, developmental delays, or hydrocephalus.

While the other options have some merit, they are less appropriate in this context:
- Option A (echocardiogram and carotid ultrasonography) is less urgent and specific for TSC.
- Option C (anti-VEGF treatment) may be considered later for retinal complications but is not the immediate priority.
- Option D (hypercoagulable workup) is not indicated based on the presented symptoms and likely diagnosis of TSC.

Therefore, ordering a brain MRI (Option B) is the most appropriate next step in evaluating and managing this patient with suspected tuberous sclerosis complex.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Thus, prednisone therapy was stopped, and the patient underwent diagnostic vitrectomy (choice B). Renal cell carcinoma is an uncommon tumor from the renal cortex, accounting for approximately 2% of systemic malignant tumors.1 Renal cell carcinoma most commonly metastasizes to the lung, bone, liver, and brain,2 and it rarely metastasizes to orbital or intraocular tissue, with fewer than 80 cases reported in the literature.1Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of metastatic RCC. There have been 3 case reports of cabozantinib causing cutaneous vasculitis but no reported ocular adverse effects.3-5 Tyrosine kinase inhibitor–associated retinal vasculitis would be a diagnosis of exclusion. If a subsequent biopsy result is negative, then it is appropriate to stop cabozantinib therapy and consider intravenous corticosteroids (choice C). The patient’s examination findings and clinical history (no hypopyon, lack of pain, and nonseptic appearance) make infectious endophthalmitis less likely (choice A). If ocular metastasis is diagnosed, obtaining a magnetic resonance image of the orbit followed by a lumbar puncture (choice D) may be a necessary next step to evaluate for brain metastasis.The most common cause of malignant intraocular tumors in adults is metastases from systemic malignant tumors. Choroidal metastases of RCC are typically dome shaped and yellow on examination, although some RCC metastases may appear reddish orange due to the high vascularity. In a review of 68 cases of ocular metastases of RCC, 50% had extraocular involvement and 50% were intraocular.1 The most frequently involved site was the orbit (36.8%), followed by the choroid (29.4%), and RCC metastases were predominantly unilateral, with only 4 bilateral reported cases.1 There is a single report in the literature of unilateral RCC ocular metastasis presenting as vitritis with no retinal or choroidal mass,6 although retinal metastasis presenting as retinal vascular sheathing and retinitis has been reported previously in other solid organ tumors.7The patient’s diagnostic vitrectomy confirmed RCC metastasis in the vitreous. The patient then developed an RD in the right eye and a redetached left eye. He underwent bilateral sequential RD repair and subsequent diagnostic vitrectomy, with aqueous and retinal biopsy of the left eye. The biopsy results demonstrated malignant cells positive for RCC (Figure 2). The patient underwent palliative radiotherapy to the orbits, but due to continued disease progression, he passed away shortly thereafter.Full-thickness retinal biopsy specimen from the left eye, with immunohistochemistry positive for CK7 (pictured with arrowheads) and PAX8 and negative for CK20 and TTF1, pointing to renal cell carcinoma metastasis (arrowheads).To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of RCC ocular metastases with aqueous and retinal biopsies and positive bilateral vitreous biopsy results. The patient initially presented with “retinal vasculitis” and panuveitis after RD repair; however, it is possible that the sclerotic vessels were a result of metastatic cellular intravascular deposits causing occlusive disease and severe nonperfusion. Metastatic RCC is a highly vascular tumor type—due to both the overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor and other proangiogenic cytokines6 and alterations in the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor gene.8 Renal cell carcinoma is metastatic in 30% of patients,9 and it portends a poor prognosis, with a median survival of approximately 13 months and a 5-year survival of less than 10%.10",Ophthalmology,2023-07-01,2023,7,"A 68-year-old man with a remote history of B-cell lymphoma and active renal cell carcinoma (RCC), receiving cabozantinib therapy, was referred for worsening hazy vision in the right eye after recent outside retinal detachment (RD) repair of the left eye, with pars plana vitrectomy and gas.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to stop prednisone and proceed with a diagnostic vitrectomy. Here's the medical reasoning behind this decision:

1. Complex clinical picture: The patient presents with a complex ocular condition, including vitritis, vasculitis, and retinal changes, in the context of a history of B-cell lymphoma and active renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with cabozantinib.

2. Inconclusive previous findings: The previous vitreous biopsy cytology was negative for malignant cells, but this doesn't rule out all potential causes of the patient's symptoms.

3. Ongoing inflammation: Despite being on oral prednisone (40 mg/day), the patient's condition has not improved, suggesting that the current treatment is ineffective or that the underlying cause hasn't been addressed.

4. Need for definitive diagnosis: Given the patient's history of malignancy and the atypical presentation, it's crucial to obtain a definitive diagnosis. A diagnostic vitrectomy would provide a larger sample of vitreous for more comprehensive testing, including cytology, flow cytometry, and PCR for infectious agents.

5. Steroid cessation: Stopping prednisone before the vitrectomy is important because steroids can mask certain findings and potentially interfere with the diagnostic accuracy of the procedure.

6. Ruling out masquerade syndromes: The patient's history of lymphoma raises concern for potential intraocular lymphoma, which can masquerade as uveitis. A diagnostic vitrectomy is the gold standard for diagnosing or ruling out intraocular lymphoma.

7. Excluding infection: While option A (intravitreal antibiotics and antivirals) might be considered, without a clear indication of infection, it's premature to start this treatment. A diagnostic vitrectomy would help rule out or confirm any infectious etiology.

8. Targeted approach: Options B (MRI and lumbar puncture) and D (stopping cabozantinib and IV steroids) are less targeted approaches at this stage. A diagnostic vitrectomy provides direct access to the affected tissue and is more likely to yield a definitive diagnosis.

By stopping prednisone and proceeding with a diagnostic vitrectomy, we can obtain the most comprehensive information to guide further management of this complex case, whether it turns out to be infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic in nature.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

While the exact pathophysiology is unknown, it is thought to be an inappropriate autoimmune response to a preceding infection caused by molecular mimicry of viral components to peripheral nerve antigens. It presents with a clinical triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia.1 Bilateral mydriasis is frequently present in typical Miller Fisher syndrome cases, but an initial presentation with bilateral mydriasis as the only symptom has rarely been reported.2 Other atypical symptoms could include headache, facial palsy, taste impairment, tachycardia, and hypertension.3,4Miller Fisher syndrome is typically associated with infectious etiologies. The most common bacterial pathogen is Campylobacter jejuni, followed by Haemophilus influenzae.5 Viral cases have been reported with Epstein-Barr virus, influenza virus, HIV, and varicella-zoster virus.5 Autoimmune and neoplastic etiologies have rarely been reported,1,6 as well as cases following vaccinations.7Imaging is important to rule out other possible diagnoses, such as brainstem abnormalities or compressive lesions.2 Magnetic resonance imaging results of the brain are usually normal, but there can be enhancement of the cranial or spinal nerve roots.8 Workup should include lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis to assure the absence of an infectious etiology for symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis can be normal or can indicate high protein with low white blood cell counts (albuminocytologic dissociation).4 In this case, the patient had previously had an extensive workup, including blood cultures (choice A) and lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid studies (choice B), which were unrevealing. Given there were no additional symptoms suggesting an infectious etiology, these tests were of low utility.The most likely diagnosis at this time was Miller Fisher syndrome, the most appropriate next step would be to order the associated antibody and start intravenous immune globulin (choice C). The anti-GQ1b antibody is detected in the serum and has an 80% to 90% sensitivity for this condition.4,8 In practice, it may take several days to weeks following serum collection for the laboratory to process, so if the patient is clinically presenting with this syndrome, then intravenous immune globulin should be started prior to the official laboratory result. This laboratory test is not necessary for diagnosing the disease but can be helpful in narrowing a diagnosis. Generally, this condition is self-limited with a good prognosis, and recurrence is rare. Patients are typically treated with intravenous immune globulin or, less preferably, plasmapheresis. There is no proven improvement in overall prognosis, but it does shorten the time to recovery compared to supportive care alone.9 Starting steroids (choice D) is not an appropriate option as steroids are no longer recommended, given they do not hasten recovery or prove effective for this condition.10The patient was treated with 2 doses of intravenous immune globulin prior to discharge.

The most appropriate next step in this case is to order anti-GQ1b antibody testing and start intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) treatment. This decision is based on the clinical presentation and progression of symptoms, which strongly suggest a diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).

The key features supporting this diagnosis include:

1. Acute onset of ataxia and ophthalmoplegia: The patient initially presented with unsteady gait and later developed complete ophthalmoplegia, which are hallmark features of MFS.

2. Areflexia: The patient's reflexes changed from brisk to diminished, indicating progressive involvement of the peripheral nervous system.

3. Mydriasis and pupillary involvement: Fixed and dilated pupils, followed by sluggish reactivity, are consistent with MFS.

4. Neuroimaging findings: Enhancement of nerve roots and the oculomotor nerve on MRI is consistent with the inflammatory process seen in GBS variants.

5. Preceding infection: The patient had upper respiratory symptoms and conjunctivitis two weeks prior, which is a common trigger for GBS and its variants.

Anti-GQ1b antibodies are highly specific for MFS, with up to 90% of patients testing positive. Ordering this test will help confirm the diagnosis. Additionally, starting IVIG immediately is crucial, as early treatment can significantly improve outcomes in GBS and its variants. IVIG is the first-line treatment for MFS and has been shown to accelerate recovery and reduce the severity of symptoms.

The other options are less appropriate:
B. Corticosteroids are not typically recommended for GBS or MFS.
C. Repeating blood cultures and starting antibiotics is not indicated, as the clinical picture is more consistent with a post-infectious autoimmune process rather than an active infection.
D.

After the initial consultation, he started an oral steroid, which was stopped due to positive Lyme disease exposure. Despite negative Lyme disease serology results, immunomodulatory therapy was deferred due to his oncologic history. As such, option 1 would not be the best course of action. Given the patient’s oncologic history, there was a concern for a neoplastic masquerade syndrome. The utility of a pars plana vitreous biopsy with or without a chorioretinal biopsy to sample the subretinal lesions identified on optical coherence tomography (Figure 2) was discussed but ultimately deferred due to the likelihood of low yield in the setting of a relatively quiet vitreous segment (option 2). It is difficult to fully exclude the likelihood that the cells were not leukemic metastases in the absence of a vitreous biopsy. However, given a sustained resolution of active anterior and vitreous segment cells after steroid treatment, a complete blood cell count not suggestive of leukocytosis, negative bone marrow biopsy a month after presentation, and a negative magnetic resonance imaging result of the brain and orbits, the likelihood of a neoplastic masquerade syndrome was thought to be low. Instead, the patient received an injection of dexamethasone into the vitreous cavity (option 3).Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography of the right eye showing hyperreflective lesions (arrowhead) in the outer retina.Immune checkpoint inhibitors have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to circumvent the protective signals that prevent the immune system from sensing and destroying malignant cells. While they have led to a decrease in the morbidity and mortality rates of individuals with cancers,1 their use has led to adverse reactions, including ocular sequelae like legal blindness, which presumably should be discussed with recipients of these treatments.A 2019 study identified all cases of ocular adverse effects that were reported to the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System database from 2003 to 2018.2 They identified 131 adverse events ranging from uveitis, dry eye, ocular myasthenia, and eye inflammation. Nivolumab had the highest number of adverse events, accounting for 68 of 131 adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.2 Here, we show that nivolumab can present with bilateral diffuse panuveitis.The precise mechanisms that mediate these events remain poorly understood. One study suggested that programmed cell death 1 inhibitors such as nivolumab produce pathologic autoantibodies that might be responsible for the high incidence of adverse effects with these drugs.3 Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 inhibitors are known to have a dose-dependent incidence of adverse effects leaving room for dose titration.4The patient’s visual acuity continued to decline (hand motions in both eyes).

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate next step would be to initiate immunomodulatory therapy with another course of oral steroids (Option D).

The patient's condition appears to be a case of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with checkpoint inhibitor therapy (nivolumab). The patient initially responded well to oral prednisone, with resolution of active anterior and vitreous cells. However, the steroid treatment was discontinued due to a positive Lyme disease exposure, leading to a significant deterioration in visual acuity and recurrence of ocular inflammation.

Several factors support the decision for another course of oral steroids:

1. Previous response: The patient showed improvement with the initial course of oral prednisone, suggesting that steroids are effective in managing the condition.

2. Exclusion of other causes: Repeat testing for Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease, and HIV was negative, and MRI showed no signs of leukemic infiltration. This makes immune-related uveitis the most likely diagnosis.

3. Severity of condition: The rapid and severe visual decline (count fingers OD, hand motions OS) indicates an urgent need for treatment.

4. Nature of the condition: Immune-related uveitis associated with checkpoint inhibitors often requires prolonged immunosuppression.

5. Comprehensive approach: Oral steroids provide systemic immunosuppression, which is beneficial in managing both ocular and potential extraocular manifestations of immune-related adverse events.

While other options like intravitreal steroid injection or pars plana vitrectomy for biopsy could be considered, they are more invasive and may not address the underlying systemic immune dysregulation as effectively as oral steroids. Observation is not appropriate given the severity and progression of the condition.

Therefore, reinitiating immunomodulatory therapy with oral steroids is the most appropriate next step to manage this patient's condition and potentially prevent further vision loss.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Presentations include blurred vision, pulsatile proptosis, orbital bruit, chemosis, corkscrew conjunctival vessels, raised intraocular pressure, and nerve palsies.1,2Indirect CCF (low-flow fistula) involves 1 or more meningeal branches of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, or both, communicating with CS. It can be spontaneous, associated with hypertension, older age, and female gender. Often asymptomatic, the most common presentation is conjunctival congestion misdiagnosed as conjunctivitis.1,3 This patient had corkscrew vessels with serous choroidal detachment (CD) and normal intraocular pressure.4,5 This may occur due to increased orbital venous pressure and intracapillary pressure in the choroid, resulting in transudation into the suprachoroidal space.5When CCF is suspected clinically, the patient requires neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit/magentic resonance angiography). Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis1,6 (choice D). Magnetic resonance angiography in this case did not reveal dilatation of the superior ophthalmic vein or abnormal flow in CS. Due to strong clinical suspicion, the patient underwent digital subtraction angiography, which showed a small extremely low-flow type B CCF (dural shunts between the meningeal branches of the internal carotid artery  and CS) on the right side. (Figure 2) Jamison et al7 described a patient with persistent red eye and glaucoma, later found to have CCF. The current case emphasizes the need to suspect CCF when a patient presents only with CD and red eye. In asymptomatic cases, close observation or ipsilateral manual carotid compression can achieve a success rate of 35%, with resolution occurring between 6 weeks and several months; 20% to 70% of these cases resolve spontaneously.1 Surgical options for closure include endovascular treatment (transarterial or transvenous) and stereotactic radiosurgery.1,6Digital subtraction angiographic image after transfemoral catheterization showing right-sided low flow type B carotid cavernous fistula (L marks the fistula). RT indicates right; INT, internal; CAR, carotid artery; LAT, lateral view.Choice A (ultrasound biomicroscopy ) is not the best option as there was no mass lesion, no sentinel conjunctival vessels (choroidal melanoma), severe pain, or inflammation (scleritis). Choice B (uveitis workup and steroids) is not an option as there was no evidence of inflammation. Choice C (thyroid profile) was not the best option because though chronic congestion can occur in thyroid eye disease, other features like eyelid retraction, proptosis, impaired extraocular movement, and systemic features of thyroid disease were absent. Low-flow CCF should be considered in cases of chronic red eye and CD. Prompt neuroimaging is essential to initiate appropriate management.The patient was advised to perform ipsilateral carotid compression with the contralateral hand for 30 seconds8 with 30-second release 6 to 7 times per hour in a sitting or supine posture, 40 to 50 times per day for 8 weeks. This resulted in resolution of the CD. Follow-up was advised every 4 to 6 weeks.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to perform Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA).

The patient presents with several concerning symptoms and signs that suggest a possible vascular abnormality:

1. Diminution of vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye for 8 months.
2. Dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels.
3. Shallow anterior chamber in the right eye.
4. 360° serous choroidal detachment partly obscuring the optic disc nasally.

These findings, particularly the dilated corkscrew vessels and choroidal detachment, are suggestive of a possible carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) or other vascular malformation. CCFs can cause increased venous pressure in the eye, leading to the observed symptoms and signs.

MRI with MRA or DSA would provide detailed imaging of the orbital and intracranial vasculature, allowing for the identification of any vascular abnormalities such as a CCF or other arteriovenous malformations. This imaging is crucial for accurate diagnosis and subsequent treatment planning.

While the other options have merit in certain situations:
- Thyroid profile (A) is less likely to explain the unilateral presentation and vascular changes.
- Uveitis workup and steroids (C) are not indicated as there are no clear signs of intraocular inflammation.
- Ultrasound biomicroscopy (D), while useful for anterior segment evaluation, would not provide the necessary information about potential vascular abnormalities.

Therefore, option B (MRI with MRA or DSA) is the most appropriate next step to investigate the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and clinical findings.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Sequence analysis identified a heterogeneous pathological variant (c.335G>A) in the PAX2 gene, confirming the clinical diagnosis (choice B). Cranial magnetic resonance imaging is not indicated, as this is not a morning glory disc anomaly (MGDA) that can be associated with a basal encephalocele or moyamoya disease (choice A). There are no historical or examination findings to suggest an underlying vasculitic condition; therefore, serological testing is not indicated (choice C). A vacant optic disc is not associated with an underlying malignancy, and for that reason, positron emission tomography is not needed (choice D).PAPRS—also known as renal-coloboma syndrome, coloboma-ureteral-renal syndrome, optic nerve coloboma with renal disease, coloboma of the optic nerve with renal disease, and optic coloboma-vesicoureteral reflux-renal anomalies—was first reported by Reiger1 in 1977, with a more extensive clinical description by Weaver et al2 in 1998. In 1995, Sanyanusin and colleagues3 discovered a variant of the PAX2 gene as the cause of PAPRS. Because of the phenotypic heterogeneity of PAPRS, experts have suggested it be termed PAX2-related disorders.4 However, not all patients with PAPRS have a known PAX2 variant.5Clinically, the syndrome is characterized by kidney and eye (one or both) abnormalities. Approximately 70% of patients will have optic disc abnormalities and approximately 10% will have retinal findings.4 A forme fruste of the disease may present with only 1 of these conditions. Kidney dysfunction resulting in end-stage kidney disease can occur at any age and can be manifested by a variety of pathology, including kidney hypoplasia or dysplasia, multicystic dysplastic kidney, oligomeganephronia, vesicoureteral reflux, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and uric acid nephrolithiasis.4 Systemic manifestations include hearing loss, growth retardation, microcephaly, developmental delay, gout, joint laxity, and soft skin.4The hallmark eye finding is an anomalous optic disc, which was initially termed a coloboma, but vacant optic disc is a more appropriate term, given the clinical features and proposed embryogenesis.6 In some cases, retinal coloboma, scleral staphyloma, optic nerve cyst, foveal hypoplasia, macular changes, and microphthalmia have been reported in conjunction with PAPRS.7Excavated or cavitary optic disc anomalies comprise a group of congenital, morphologically distinct conditions, which include vacant optic disc, MGDA, optic disc coloboma, megallopapilla, optic disc pit, and peripapillary staphyloma. However, some have considered these anomalies to be along a spectrum because certain optic discs do not conform to any one particular entity.8Located on chromosome 10, the PAX2 gene is within the PAX family of genes that includes 8 other members. The PAX2 gene encodes a transcriptional factor that is important in the development of the eye, kidneys, and central nervous system.9 Parsa and colleagues5 have hypothesized that the vacant optic disc arises from deficiency in vascular development during embryogenesis, resulting in the absence of central retinal vessels within the excavated optic disc, with the peripheral vasculature representing cilioretinal vessels. In comparison, an optic disc coloboma demonstrates an absence of tissue in the inferonasal quadrant of the disc and the central retinal vessels emerge superotemporally from the unaffected portion of the disc. Recognizing a vacant optic disc and differentiating it from MGDA and optic disc coloboma is essential, as it can lead to early recognition and treatment of unrecognized kidney disease.10The patient was evaluated by a geneticist to discuss the implications of the PAX2 gene variant and was explained the 50% risk of transmitting the genetic variant to her children.",Ophthalmology,2023-05-01,2023,5,"A 72-year-old woman was referred for an eye examination because of visual changes in the left eye.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate next step would be genetic testing (Option D). Here's the medical explanation for this decision:

1. Early-onset proteinuria: The patient reported having proteinuria since age 7, which suggests a hereditary kidney disorder.

2. End-stage kidney disease requiring transplants: The patient needed two kidney transplants, indicating a severe and progressive renal condition.

3. Optic disc anomalies: Both optic discs are described as anomalous, with central excavation and peripheral location of blood vessels. These findings are consistent with optic nerve colobomas, which can be associated with certain genetic syndromes.

4. Absence of other systemic symptoms: The case doesn't mention signs of vasculitis, central nervous system involvement, or systemic inflammation that would warrant options A, B, or C.

5. Family history: Although the family history is reported as unremarkable, the patient has two healthy adult children, which doesn't rule out an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.

Given these factors, the clinical picture strongly suggests a genetic disorder affecting both the kidneys and eyes. The combination of early-onset proteinuria, end-stage renal disease, and optic disc anomalies is consistent with conditions such as Alport syndrome or other hereditary nephropathies with ocular involvement.

Genetic testing would help confirm the underlying diagnosis, which is crucial for:
- Understanding the patient's condition and its prognosis
- Guiding appropriate management and follow-up
- Providing genetic counseling for the patient's children and other family members

Therefore, genetic testing is the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases. You will be presented with a clinical case and a set of options. Your role is to:

A hypopyon forms when white exudate collects in the inferior aspect of the anterior chamber (AC). When a hypopyon consists of neoplastic cells, the term pseudohypopyon is used. However, the appearance is identical to a hypopyon resulting from suppurative infection or inflammation.1 In this patient, AC aspiration was done and showed malignant cells (Figure 2), confirming AML relapse with monocytic differentiation.Cytology of anterior chamber aspirate showing malignant cells confirming intraocular relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (Giemsa stain, original magnification ×40).Leukemia accounts for 34.8% of ocular metastases affecting the retina, choroid, optic nerve, vitreous, iris, and AC.2 Acute leukemias present more frequently with ocular manifestations than in chronic leukemias,3 with ocular involvement ranging from 32% to 35.5%.4 Ocular involvement of the anterior segment specifically due to acute lymphocytic leukemia relapse ranges from 2.5% to 18%, while anterior involvement in AML relapse is very rare.1The differential diagnosis for hypopyon includes 4 broad categories: noninfectious inflammation, infectious, neoplastic, and corneal etiologies.1 Noninfectious causes include uveitis, most commonly HLA B-27–associated or Behçet disease–associated inflammation, and postsurgical or medical-induced inflammation, such as with rifabutin.5 Infectious causes can be exogenous with postsurgical or traumatic inoculation or endogenous, such as endogenous endophthalmitis from hematological spread. Hypopyon due to neoplasia can be caused by leukemia, lymphoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, or metastases. Finally, corneal etiologies include microbial keratitis or noninfectious chemical or traumatic injuries. Recognition on physical examination and proper investigation is crucial for correct diagnosis and treatment, as hypopyon usually occurs with specific conditions rather than as a universal ocular inflammatory response.1Option C, perform AC aspiration (as this can detect neoplastic cells) and inject intravitreal antibiotics, is the correct next step.6-8 Although rare, given this patient’s history of AML, suspicion for infiltrative pseudohypopyon as a mimicker of reactive intraocular inflammation should be raised. However, this patient is immunocompromised with a recent PICC, so an infectious process must be kept on the differential. Broad-spectrum intravitreal antibiotics, such as vancomycin and ceftazidime, should be injected until AC aspiration results return, as the consequences of untreated endophthalmitis are severe.8Option A is incorrect. A 2022 study has shown that ocular inflammation can occur in the weeks following subretinal administration of voretigene neparvovec gene therapy9; however, this patient underwent treatment years ago. Option B, perform vitrectomy, is incorrect as there is not evidence of posterior segment inflammation, the patient’s vision does not meet criteria by the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study, and there are less invasive methods for specimen evaluation. Endophthalmitis can occur in the setting of a blood-borne infection, but awaiting systemic laboratory tests and blood culture results, option D, would not help distinguish between AML pseudohypopyon vs endophthalmitis and would delay endophthalmitis treatment. Additionally, it has been suggested that leukemic pseudohypopyon can be associated with relapse even if leukemia is not systemically detected.10The patient was admitted and started venetoclax combined with fludarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin chemotherapy and received low-dose 1400 cGy involved-field radiotherapy to the eyes for 1 week.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to obtain a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and inject intravitreal antibiotics.

This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Acute onset: The patient has a 5-day history of bilateral ocular symptoms, including blurry vision, redness, discharge, photophobia, and pain. This acute presentation suggests an active, potentially severe infection.

2. Immunocompromised state: The patient has a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and recent chemotherapy, which has resulted in neutropenia and other cytopenias. This immunocompromised state puts her at high risk for opportunistic infections.

3. Clinical findings: The examination reveals significant anterior chamber inflammation with hypopyon in both eyes, along with elevated intraocular pressure. These findings are consistent with endophthalmitis, a serious intraocular infection.

4. Recent invasive procedure: The patient had a PICC line removed 2 weeks ago, which could be a potential source of infection.

Given these factors, it is crucial to obtain a sample of the hypopyon for microbiological analysis and to start immediate treatment with intravitreal antibiotics. This approach allows for:

1. Identification of the causative organism, which is essential for targeted therapy.
2. Immediate initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment while awaiting culture results.

While awaiting systemic test results (option A) is important, it should not delay the urgent ocular intervention needed in this case. Observation (option C) is inappropriate given the severity and acuity of the presentation. Performing a pars plana vitrectomy (option D) may be considered later but is not the immediate next step without first obtaining a sample and initiating antibiotic treatment.

In summary, obtaining a sample through paracentesis and injecting intravitreal antibiotics is the most appropriate immediate action to diagnose and treat what appears to be endophthalmitis in an immunocompromised patient.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

The option of systemic cidofovir and CMV immune globulin or continued treatment with intravitreal ganciclovir and foscarnet would be suboptimal, as no significant improvement was seen using these medications in the context of documented mutations in the UL97 and UL54 genes. A mutation in the UL97 gene confers resistance to ganciclovir and valganciclovir, while mutation in the UL54 gene confers resistance to ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir.1-3 Furthermore, the patient did not tolerate biweekly intravitreal injections because of pain and transient vision changes. Leflunomide would be an option; however, in the context of the patient’s high viral load, resistance would likely develop quickly, resulting in only a transient effect.4Cytotoxic T lymphocytes are a novel therapy for CMV retinitis that is refractory to available therapies. A type of immunotherapy, CTLs involve adoptive transfer of donor T cells to provide a virus-specific immune response to clear infection.5 This patient received posoleucel, a multivirus-specific T-cell therapy, with dramatic improvement in both retinal findings (Figure 2) and CMV titers (2.24 million IU/mL to 14 700 IU/mL) 1 month after the first infusion. There was complete resolution of active retinitis with residual scarring. Visual acuity remained stable at 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS.Ultra-widefield fundus photograph of the right eye after multivirus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte therapy demonstrates resolution of active cytomegalovirus retinitis and cotton wool spots with residual areas of partially pigmented scarring (arrowheads).There have been a handful of cases in the literature on outcomes of CMV retinitis treated with CTL therapy.5-7 Gupta et al5 presented a series of 7 patients treated with CMV-specific T cells in which 90% of eyes achieved disease resolution and 80% had stable or improved visual acuity. Prior to CTL therapy, all patients had progressive retinitis despite systemic and intravitreal antiviral therapy. Three patients had UL97 mutations, and 1 patient had a UL54 mutation. Underlying immunosuppression was secondary to stem cell transplant in 4 patients, AIDS in 2 patients, and kidney transplant in 1 patient.5 Treatment was well tolerated in the limited sample size with no cases of immune recovery uveitis, 1 case of cystoid macular edema, and 2 cases of retinal detachment.5 In addition to ocular adverse effects, systemic adverse effects of CTL therapy described in the oncology literature can include cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and cytopenias.8 Compared with the series from Gupta et al,5 we used multivirus-specific T-cell therapy rather than CMV-specific T cells.The patient returned 8 weeks after their initial diagnosis (6 weeks after the first infusion) with decreased vision. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 OD and 20/60 OS. Optical coherence tomography showed new subretinal fluid under the fovea in both eyes, and retinal thickness had increased (right eye: 273 to 336 μm; left eye: 273 to 324 μm). CMV lesions in both eyes remained inactive. Unfortunately, before any additional testing could occur, the patient rapidly declined from complications of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder and transitioned to hospice. The patient’s decreased vision could represent an adverse effect of CTL therapy or cidofovir, but the critically ill status of the patient precluded definitive diagnosis.

[Explanation]
Given the complex clinical scenario presented, option B - Multivirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) - appears to be the most appropriate next step for this patient.

The patient has a history of kidney transplant and CMV infection with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir (UL97 and UL54 gene mutations). The current presentation involves CMV retinitis, which has failed to respond to intravitreal foscarnet and ganciclovir injections. Additionally, the patient has refused further intravitreal therapy due to side effects.

Considering these factors:

1. Option A (Observation with systemic cidofovir and CMV immune globulin) is likely insufficient, as the patient's condition is vision-threatening and requires active intervention.

2. Option C (Leflunomide initiation) is not typically a first-line treatment for CMV retinitis and may not be potent enough given the severity of the case.

3. Option D (Continued foscarnet and ganciclovir intravitreal injections) is not feasible as the patient has refused further intravitreal therapy and has shown resistance to these medications.

4. Option B (Multivirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes) offers a novel approach that addresses several key issues:
   - It bypasses the drug resistance problem by using the patient's immune system to target the virus.
   - It avoids the need for intravitreal injections, which the patient has refused.
   - CTLs can provide long-lasting protection against viral reactivation.
   - This approach is particularly suitable for transplant patients with drug-resistant CMV infections.

Multivirus-specific CTLs have shown promise in treating drug-resistant CMV infections in transplant recipients. This therapy can potentially control the CMV infection systemically and locally in the eye, addressing both the retinitis and the underlying viremia. It represents a targeted, immunotherapy-based approach that may be more effective in this complex case where conventional antiviral treatments have failed.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

His condition worsened despite treatment with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, thus raising suspicion for an alternative etiology. Although invasive fungal sinusitis was considered on the differential diagnosis due to his immunocompromised state, neither bedside nasal endoscopy nor computed tomography of the sinus was suggestive of the disease. Therefore, antifungals were not started (choice A), and sinus biopsies were not pursued (choice B).An inflammatory etiology was considered, given the multifocal involvement observed on imaging (right orbit, left sphenoid sinus, masticator space). On further probing, the patient reported he received his first infusion of zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate, as part of his treatment for multiple myeloma 3 days prior to presentation. Given the acute onset of symptoms within 72 hours of the first zoledronic acid infusion, a diagnosis of orbital inflammatory disease due to bisphosphonate infusion was suspected. Treatment with intravenous pulse methylprednisolone was initiated (choice C). Due to the suspected etiology and the acute nature of the presentation, an orbital biopsy would not be the best next option (choice D).Bisphosphonates are commonly used in osteoclast-mediated bone loss due to osteoporosis, Paget disease of bone, bone metastases, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and multiple myeloma.1 Bisphosphonate-induced orbital and ocular inflammation is uncommon and has been described in both case reports and case series. With widespread use of bisphosphonates, orbital and sinus inflammation is becoming an increasingly recognized adverse effect.2 Ocular adverse effects include anterior uveitis, scleritis, and optic neuritis.3 Orbital inflammation can be severe and occurs acutely, usually within 72 hours of medication administration when given intravenously and within 2 to 3 weeks when given orally.2,4-7The close temporal association between the infusion of zoledronate and the onset of orbital inflammation in this patient is consistent with prior reports. Prompt administration of corticosteroids was associated with good response.2,4-7 Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy, but the ideal dosing strategy and taper schedule is unclear. Discontinuation of bisphosphonates is recommended; in most reported cases, the bisphosphonate was discontinued. There is 1 report of a patient who continued monthly bisphosphonate therapy without recurrence of orbital inflammation.5 Further studies are needed to clarify the likelihood of recurrence if patients continue taking bisphosphonates.This patient received intravenous solumedrol, 500 mg, daily for 2 days with immediate marked clinical improvement (Figure 2).

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and the progression of symptoms despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, the most appropriate next step would be to start corticosteroids (Option B).

The patient's clinical picture suggests orbital inflammatory syndrome (OIS), also known as idiopathic orbital inflammation or orbital pseudotumor, rather than infectious orbital cellulitis. Several factors support this diagnosis:

1. Worsening symptoms despite appropriate antibiotic therapy: The patient's condition deteriorated after 48 hours of ampicillin-sulbactam and even after broadening to vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

2. Imaging findings: MRI shows diffuse enhancement of orbital tissues, including intraconal and extraconal fat, as well as extraocular muscle involvement, which is more consistent with an inflammatory process than a localized infection.

3. Absence of sinus disease or invasive fungal infection: Both CT and nasal endoscopy ruled out invasive fungal sinusitis, making fungal infection less likely.

4. Patient's medical history: The patient has multiple myeloma and is on immunomodulatory therapy (daratumumab), which can predispose to inflammatory conditions.

Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for OIS and can lead to rapid improvement in symptoms. Starting corticosteroids would help confirm the diagnosis if the patient responds positively. It's important to note that while corticosteroids can worsen an infection, the clinical picture and lack of response to antibiotics make an infectious etiology less likely.

Orbital biopsy (A) is invasive and usually reserved for cases where malignancy is suspected or when there's no response to corticosteroids. Antifungal therapy (C) is not indicated given the lack of evidence for fungal infection. Sinus biopsies (D) are unnecessary as imaging and endoscopy have not shown evidence of significant sinus involvement or invasive fungal disease.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Multiple pustules on the hand accompanying C1/C2 spondylitis and spondylodiscitis and tenderness in the right sternoclavicular articulation reminded us of suspicion of synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome. A whole-body bone scintigraphy was ordered, revealing the classic bull head sign with increased tracer uptake in bilateral sternoclavicular joints and the sternal angle (Figure 2), which is highly specific for SAPHO syndrome.3Whole-body bone scintigraphy showed increased tracer uptake in bilateral sternoclavicular joints, the sternal angle (bull head sign), and cervical vertebral bodies.First described by Chamot et al,4 SAPHO syndrome is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by dermatological and osteoarticular symptoms. Infectious, genetic susceptibility, immunological, and environmental factors may play a role in the development of the disease. Propionibacterium acnes antigen has been only occasionally found in bacterial cultures. An association between CSF2RA, NOD2, MEGF6, and ADAM5 genes and the predisposition of SAPHO syndrome has been established.5 Elevated serum IgG4 and some cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL) 6, IL-8, IL-18, IL-23 and endothelin-1, have been described in patients with SAPHO syndrome.6 In laboratory tests, and features of an active inflammatory process (accelerated ESR, elevated CRP) are observed.7The diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome is based on fulfilling at least 1 of the criteria described by Kahn and Kahn,8 which include (1) chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, usually sterile, spine may be involved, with or without skin lesions, (2) acute, subacute, or chronic arthritis associated with any of the following: palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), pustular psoriasis, or severe acne, and (3) any sterile osteitis associated with any of the following: PPP, pustular psoriasis, psoriasis vulgaris, or severe acne. Sternocostoclavicular osteitis and hyperostosis, spondyloarthritis with hyperostosis, and PPP are the most common triad of the disease occurring in adults.9 As the osteoarticular and skin manifestations often do not occur simultaneously, the diagnosis can be difficult.As the cause is unknown, no consensus has been reached on the treatment of SAPHO syndrome. The primary goal of treatment is the improvement of clinical symptoms, thereby improving patients’ quality of life in the long term. Current treatment options for SAPHO syndrome include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and biologics.10After oral etoricoxib and prednisolone treatment, neck pain and pustules gradually subsided and ESR and CRP decreased.

Rituximab and radiotherapy (choice B) would not be indicated prior to definitive diagnosis but could be used to treat choroidal lymphoma.

A positron emission tomography scan (choice C) was recommended to look for systemic disease, which showed fluorodeoxyglucose-avid soft tissue abnormalities along the bilateral neuroforamina, upper ribs, and paraspinal muscles.

On immunohistochemical studies, the histiocytes were positive for CD163 and Factor 13a, negative for CD1a and langerin, and showed weak patchy S100 expression (not pictured) (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×400).ECD is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by tissue infiltration of foamy (xanthomatous) CD68-positive, CD1a/S100–negative histiocytes.1 To our knowledge, there are less than 1200 reported cases worldwide.1 Men aged 40 to 70 years are most often affected. Diagnosis can be challenging as it often requires extensive imaging, histology, and genetic testing.1 Although there are numerous common radiographic signs, positron emission tomography  is recommended for initial evaluation because it can accurately detect organ system involvement and aid in identification of a biopsy target.1 Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can also be helpful for diagnosis, as can radiography, which may establish the presence of bone involvement. On histopathology, ECD should be separated from other histiocytic disorders, such as Rosai-Dorfman disease and adult xanthogranulomatous disease.2-4﻿ BRAF V600E variation has been identified in up to 60% of ECD cases.5﻿ BRAF is a protooncogene involved in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this disease.1,5 BRAF and MEK inhibitors have become first line treatment for ECD.6ECD can infiltrate nearly every tissue, including cardiac, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, integumentary, kidney, central nervous system, and eye tissues. Central nervous system disease is seen in up to 92% of patients with ECD and is an independent predictor of death.6 Ophthalmic manifestations include infiltration of the eyelids, orbit, optic nerve, cornea, choroid, and retina.1 Chorioretinal infiltration is a rare presentation of ECD7 and often appears as yellow or yellow-white lesions that can be associated with subretinal fluid, as in this patient. The retinal pigment epithelium can show pigmentary changes and atrophy that create a speckled hyperautofluorescent and hypoautofluorescent appearance similar to the leopard-spotting presentation in this patient.1 The lesions are hypocyanescent on indocyanine green angiography and hyperreflective on ultrasonography.1 Rarely, the choroidal lesions can be associated with choroidal neovascularization.8Treatment for ocular involvement of ECD is ultimately aimed at controlling the underlying systemic condition. If a patient has a BRAF V600E variant, BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, can be used.6 Subretinal fluid associated with ECD choroidal infiltration can be treated with intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor, intravitreal methotrexate, or photodynamic therapy, but recurrences are common without systemic treatment.1,9This patient started treatment with an MEK inhibitor, cobimetinib.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan.

The patient presents with a choroidal lesion, which, given its characteristics (amelanotic, associated with subretinal fluid, and showing a leopard-spotting pattern on autofluorescence), raises suspicion for a possible lymphoproliferative disorder. This suspicion is further supported by the patient's family history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia.

A PET scan is an excellent tool for detecting and staging lymphoma and other malignancies. It can help identify if there are any other sites of disease involvement throughout the body, which is crucial for determining the extent of the disease and guiding further management.

The other options are less appropriate at this stage:

A. Rituximab and radiotherapy would be premature without a definitive diagnosis and staging.

B. Plaque brachytherapy is typically used for treating localized ocular tumors, but it's not appropriate without a confirmed diagnosis.

D. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy, while potentially useful for diagnosis, carries risks when performed on intraocular lesions and may not be necessary if systemic involvement can be detected through less invasive means like a PET scan.

An initial deltoid muscle biopsy did not show evidence of myopathy. Because the patient’s symptoms were worsening, a second muscle biopsy of vastus lateralis was performed. This revealed atrophic myofibers with a patchy granular appearance (Figure 1B).

Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy,D,Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy,"Electron microscopy of the vastus lateralis muscle biopsy identified nemaline rods within several muscle fibers (Figure 2). A diagnosis was made of sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy (SLONM) associated with monoclonal gammopathy. The patient received a 6-month trial of intravenous immunoglobulin without clinical improvement. He has subsequently been referred for hematological evaluation and potential autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.Electron micrograph (original magnification ×8200) demonstrating the presence of nemaline rods in a subsarcolemmal position along the periphery of a muscle fiber (white arrowhead).SLONM is a rare, acquired, adult-onset progressive myopathy first described by A. G. Engel in 1966.1 The typical clinical phenotype is characterized by weakness and atrophy of predominantly proximal and axial muscles, which may lead to camptocormia or head drop. Dysphagia and dyspnea are common, occurring in approximately 50% of cases,2 with respiratory failure a common cause of death.3 Cardiac involvement is reported, manifesting as conduction abnormalities and/or cardiomyopathy.2,4Creatine kinase levels are typically normal or mildly elevated, while electromyography shows myopathic motor units and fibrillation potentials.3 Magnetic resonance imaging may show preferential involvement of the neck extensors, paraspinal, gluteal, hamstring, and soleus muscles.4 The distinctive pathological hallmark of SLONM is the visualization of nemaline rods in myofibers on light or electron microscopy. Associated histopathological findings include myofiber atrophy, myofibrillar disintegration, corelike areas, vacuolar changes, fiber necrosis, inflammatory infiltrates, and mitochondrial changes.2 Importantly, initial muscle biopsy may be nondiagnostic in up to one-third of SLONM cases, necessitating a second muscle biopsy when clinical suspicion is high.5Key paraclinical associations of late-onset nemaline myopathy include monoclonal gammopathy and HIV infection. Monoclonal gammopathy is present in approximately 50% of SLONM cases and typically comprises an IgG paraprotein with either κ or λ light chains. Multiple myeloma is rare.2 It is important to note that late-onset nemaline myopathy is clinically and pathologically distinct from the congenital nemaline myopathies, although rare cases of adult-onset familial nemaline myopathy have been reported.6 As such, genetic testing should be considered in the presence of family history or if atypical features are present.The natural history of SLONM is progressive weakness leading to death usually within 1 to 5 years from symptom onset. There is conflicting evidence as to whether the presence of monoclonal gammopathy is associated with worse prognosis.3,5 SLONM, particularly when associated with monoclonal gammopathy, appears to be poorly responsive to immunotherapies.2,3 Nevertheless, some patients with SLONM demonstrate marked and sustained response to intravenous immunoglobulin, which has therefore been suggested as a first-line therapy.5 For patients who do not respond to immunotherapy, or for those with a more aggressive disease course, chemotherapy-based treatments with or without autologous stem cell transplantation have been shown to achieve higher rates of neurological improvement, complete remission, and overall survival.7,8",Neurology,2022-12-01,2022,12,"A 72-year-old man presented with mild proximal weakness developing into progressive camptocormia, head drop, and prominent dysphagia over a 2-year period.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate diagnosis for this case is Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy (SLONM). This conclusion is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings:

1. Age and onset: The patient is 72 years old with symptoms developing over a 2-year period, which is consistent with the late-onset nature of SLONM.

2. Clinical features: The patient presents with proximal weakness, camptocormia (forward flexion of the spine), head drop, and dysphagia. These are characteristic features of SLONM, particularly the axial weakness leading to camptocormia.

3. Muscle biopsy findings: The second muscle biopsy revealed atrophic myofibers with a patchy granular appearance. This is highly suggestive of nemaline rods, which are the hallmark histological feature of nemaline myopathy.

4. Electromyography results: The EMG showed a myopathic pattern with small, brief, polyphasic units, particularly in proximal and axial muscles, which is consistent with a myopathic process like SLONM.

5. Exclusion of other diagnoses: Normal creatine kinase levels and the absence of spontaneous activity on EMG make inflammatory myopathies less likely. The lack of significant findings on metabolic, endocrine, autoimmune, and infectious screens, as well as the normal PET scan, help rule out other systemic conditions.

6. Associated condition: The presence of a small IgG κ paraprotein is noteworthy, as SLONM can be associated with monoclonal gammopathy, although in this case, the bone marrow biopsy was normal.

While the low-positive Mi2 antibodies might suggest a possible inflammatory myopathy, the overall clinical picture, especially the muscle biopsy findings, is more consistent with SLONM. The other options (myasthenia gravis, paraneoplastic myositis, and late-onset Pompe disease) do not fit as well with the presented clinical and histological features.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

However, neither of these choices are appropriate, given apparent patency of the Baerveldt tube and the patient’s systemic symptoms.Systemic workup, including chest imaging (B), is the best choice given the patient’s symptoms and examination findings. The patient’s facial edema, sinus congestion, and dysphagia point to superior thoracic venous outflow obstruction. His elevated IOP can be explained by elevated episcleral venous pressure (EVP).EVP contributes to IOP. However, it is not typically measured clinically because of difficulty in obtaining accurate, noninvasive measurements.3,4 EVP is determined by vascular tone and gravity and is independent of IOP and aqueous production.5 Examination findings of elevated EVP beyond elevated IOP include dilated, tortuous episcleral vessels that do not blanch with topical constrictors, chemosis, and blood in the Schlemm canal on gonioscopy. The differential diagnosis for elevated EVP includes orbital varix, Sturge-Weber syndrome, direct and indirect carotid cavernous fistulas, cavernous sinus syndrome, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. Additionally, behaviors such as playing a high-resistance wind instrument,6 wearing a tight tie,7 and performing postural inversions8 are thought to be associated with increased EVP.In this patient, SVC syndrome best accounts for his presentation. Examination findings typical of SVC syndrome include plethora, orbital congestion, cyanosis, proptosis, and increased IOP that worsen with recumbent positioning.5 The mechanism of elevated IOP in SVC syndrome is increased venous pressure in the jugular vein causing retrograde congestion in the ophthalmic veins and elevated EVP.5 SVC syndrome may be caused by neoplasms, aortic aneurysms, or central venous stenosis secondary to indwelling catheters and stents.9 Given the subacute presentation and severe fatigue in this patient, neoplastic etiology appears most likely.Workup for this patient included computed tomography chest scan, which revealed a large mediastinal neoplasm encasing the SVC (Figure 2). The left internal jugular vein was substantially more stenotic than the right. Subsequent supraclavicular lymph node biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.Chest computed tomography with contrast showed an 8 × 15 × 16-cm mediastinal mass (yellow arrowhead) encasing the great vessels of the aortic arch and superior vena cava. The lumen of the left jugular vein (blue arrowhead) is substantially more stenotic than the right jugular vein (white arrowhead). Inset, Chest computed tomography 6 months after completion of chemotherapy and radiation showed marked reduction of the mediastinal mass.The patient received chemotherapy and radiation treatment. His IOP after treatment returned to the baseline of 13 to 16 mm Hg.

Explanation:
Given the complex clinical presentation of this patient, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a systemic workup, including chest imaging (Option D). This decision is based on several key factors from the case:

1. Systemic symptoms: The patient is experiencing severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion. These symptoms, particularly in combination, suggest a potential systemic issue that requires further investigation.

2. Facial edema and erythema: The external examination revealed diffuse facial edema and erythema without proptosis. This finding, along with the systemic symptoms, raises concerns about a possible underlying systemic condition, such as superior vena cava syndrome or another vascular or inflammatory process.

3. Glaucoma progression: While the patient's glaucoma has progressed, and his IOP is above target, the systemic symptoms and facial changes are more concerning at this point and need to be addressed first.

4. Complex medical history: The patient has a history of severe primary open-angle glaucoma, previous eye surgeries, and is on multiple ophthalmic medications. This complex ocular history makes it crucial to rule out any systemic conditions that could be impacting his overall health and potentially affecting his eye condition.

Exenteration has been shown to provide better local control with clear margins obtained in 42.5% to 97% of cases and lower rates of local recurrence with overall survival of 83% and 65% at 1 and 5 years, respectively.2 However, recently, the overall survival benefit of exenteration vs conservative surgeries has been questioned.2-4 In addition, exenteration causes facial disfigurement, loss of vision, psychological distress, and some, like this patient, may decline this surgery.Recent reports have shown favorable outcomes with new immunotherapy treatments without exenteration in patients with locally advanced SCC with orbital extension.2,4,5 Cutaneous SCC has demonstrated excellent response to immunotherapy, with phase 1 and 2 trials demonstrating a 44% to 50% response rate.6 In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration approved cemiplimab for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic cutaneous SCC based on phase 1 and 2 trials.7 The 2020 European interdisciplinary guidelines indicate cemiplimab as first-line treatment for advanced SCC not treatable with curative surgery or radiotherapy (grade A recommendation; level 2 evidence).8 A phase 2 study on the efficacy of neoadjuvant cemiplimab in head and neck SCC found complete pathologic response in 55% of patients, who ultimately did not receive radiotherapy after surgery.9 No guidelines exist on the duration of immunotherapy treatment, and clinical trials are underway to address the emerging role of cemiplimab in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Adverse effects from immune checkpoint inhibitors are common, including fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, nausea, and cough. Cemiplimab is generally well tolerated with a discontinuation rate of 8% in a phase 2 study.7 Serious autoimmune-related adverse effects can be fatal and require prompt management. In this patient, cemiplimab treatment was started until definitive surgical resection was performed. Palliative radiotherapy (choice C) can preserve vision but is noncurative.10 Traditional chemotherapy and cetuximab treatment (choice A and D) have low efficacy and durability in patients with advanced SCC.7The patient started cemiplimab treatment. After 3 months of immunotherapy, the mass decreased significantly to 2.5 cm (Figure 2).

Advanced disease: The patient has a large, recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with significant local invasion, including erosion through the right sphenoid wing, involvement of the lacrimal gland, and abutment of the lateral rectus. This advanced stage requires an aggressive treatment approach.

2. Patient preference: The patient is strongly against orbital exenteration, which limits treatment options. A globe-sparing approach aligns with the patient's wishes while still addressing the tumor.

3. Immunotherapy effectiveness: Cemiplimab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, has shown promising results in advanced cutaneous SCC. Neoadjuvant (pre-surgical) use of immunotherapy can help shrink the tumor, making subsequent surgery more effective and potentially less extensive.

4. Combination approach: This option combines systemic therapy (immunotherapy) with local treatment (surgery), which is often beneficial in managing advanced cancers. The immunotherapy may help control both the primary tumor and potential micrometastases.

5. Preservation of function: A globe-sparing orbitotomy aims to remove the tumor while preserving the eye and its function, which is important for the patient's quality of life.

6. Curative intent: This approach offers the best chance for long-term control or cure of the disease, as opposed to palliative options.

While other options like partial debulking or palliative radiotherapy might provide temporary relief, they are less likely to offer long-term disease control in this advanced case. Platinum-based chemotherapy, while sometimes used in advanced SCC, is generally less effective and more toxic than immunotherapy in this setting.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

<clinical_case>
A 72-year-old homeless man was referred for management of a recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right temple and brow. On review of history, maxillofacial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast done 5 months prior to presentation showed a 5.9 × 5.3 × 3.7-cm mass centered at the right temple that tracked along the right lateral orbital wall as well as an enhancing right intraparotid lymph node. The patient was lost to follow-up and re-presented 5 months later with an enlarged crusting and ulcerating lesion of the right temple/brow (Figure 1A). On ocular examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/125 OS due to cataracts, pupils reacted normally without afferent pupillary defect, and ocular motility was full. He had mild proptosis in the right eye and right lower eyelid retraction. Orbicularis strength was intact and symmetric in both eyes. MRI of the orbits, face, and neck with and without contrast showed a 6.1 × 5.7 × 4.0-cm mass with erosion through the right sphenoid wing, involvement of the lacrimal gland, and abutment of the lateral rectus (Figure 1B). In discussing treatment strategies for the orbital component of the disease, the patient was strongly against an orbital exenteration.A, External photograph showing a large right brow mass with overlying crust after the patient was lost to follow-up and re-presented 5 months later.

RDD disease is a subtype of histiocytosis, in which clonal expansion of activated histiocytes accumulate in tissues including the lymph nodes and possibly the eye. Given the myelogenous derivation of histiocytic disease, targeted delivery of melphalan (choice C) is emerging as a treatment option for isolated, symptomatic disease, particularly of ocular structures. It is standard care for retinoblastoma and has few adverse events.1 Following 3 monthly infusions of intra-arterial melphalan (9 mg) administered to the ophthalmic artery, the episcleral/uveal nodule regressed, the pain abated, oral steroids and all topical drops were discontinued, and the corrected visual acuity improved to 20/20 (Figure 2).Posttreatment. External photograph and corresponding ultrasound biomicroscopy (inset) demonstrating regression of the sclerouveal nodule. Arrowheads demonstrate the site of regressed disease.Histiocytoses are rare hematologic disorders characterized by pathological accumulation and infiltration of activated histiocytes in affected tissues, including ophthalmic structures. The non–Langerhans cell histiocytoses include RDD disease and are clinically heterogenous, including vision-threatening structures (such as the orbit, uveal tract, optic nerves, or the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis).2,3 This case demonstrated an episcleral nodule  with sclerouveal infiltration seen with ultrasound biomicroscopy. Despite oral and topical steroids, she had no improvement. Switching to a different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (choice A), administering local steroids (choice D), or initiating an alternative immunomodulatory agent (choice B) would likely have provided no relief or only temporary therapeutic relief for this histiocytic-derived disease.4 Given the threat to her vision, an escalated treatment strategy was needed.Because histiocytic neoplasms are hematologic in their pathogenesis, we considered intra-arterial melphalan as a potential therapeutic option. Melphalan is an alkylating agent of mustard gas derivation used for blood-based neoplasms, notably multiple myeloma.5 Small case reports/series suggest histiocytic disease is sensitive to melphalan and similarly derived drugs.6 We have reported a small series of patients with neurologic or orbital histiocytosis treated with intra-arterial melphalan.7The advantage of intra-arterial chemotherapy is delivering a therapeutic dose to the target lesion while minimizing systemic administration. We are familiar with the safety and toxicity of intra-arterial melphalan administration to the eye because of our extensive experience in the treatment of retinoblastoma.1,8 Melphalan may be appealing for local administration because it is rapidly eliminated and has no neurotoxicity and limited ophthalmic toxicity with intra-arterial delivery.1 Melphalan is myelosuppressive in a dose-dependent manner, and particularly at systemic doses.This patient had no myelosuppression or other systemic toxic reactions following her 3 courses of 9-mg intra-arterial melphalan. Instead, she had a sustained ocular response, which allowed her to discontinue systemic steroids, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and all eye drops. She continued to have a sustained response at 10 months’ follow-up (Figure 2). Focal radiotherapy could have been a consideration; however, outcomes in RDD disease affecting neurologic and ophthalmic structures have been variable.4 Systemic therapies such as thalidomide, cladribine, and other chemotherapeutic/immunomodulatory agents would have been reasonable2; however, we attempted local therapy owing to her site-limited disease.In summary, we highlight that ocular histiocytosis may masquerade as refractory nodular scleritis. We describe implementation of intra-arterial chemotherapy for this vision-threatening intraocular histiocytosis with sclerouveal infiltration. This treatment approach might benefit from broader evaluation of its feasibility and safety across a variety of tumor sites and arterial targets, as well as its efficacy.",Ophthalmology,2022-09-01,2022,9,"A 59-year-old woman with a 5-year history of intermittent bilateral uveitis and scleritis presented with painful left uveitis and an episcleral nodule (Figure 1).

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to initiate an alternative systemic therapy, specifically an immunomodulatory agent. This decision is based on several factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Chronic nature of the disease: The patient has a 5-year history of intermittent bilateral uveitis and scleritis, indicating a chronic inflammatory condition.

2. Failure of current treatment: The patient has been on oral prednisone, topical prednisolone, and oral ibuprofen for 10 days without relief, suggesting resistance to the current treatment regimen.

3. Steroid-related complications: The patient is suspected of being a steroid responder due to elevated intraocular pressure bilaterally, which limits the use of further corticosteroid therapy.

4. Underlying systemic condition: The patient has been diagnosed with Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (RDD) disease, a rare histiocytic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems, including the eyes.

5. Localized disease: Staging evaluations showed no other sites of RDD disease, suggesting that the ocular manifestation is the primary concern at this time.

Given these factors, initiating an immunomodulatory agent would be the most appropriate next step. Immunomodulatory agents can help control the underlying inflammatory process associated with RDD disease and uveitis while potentially allowing for a reduction in steroid use. This approach addresses both the ocular inflammation and the systemic nature of the disease, potentially providing long-term control with fewer side effects compared to chronic steroid use.

The other options are less suitable:
- Intra-arterial melphalan (B) is typically used for retinoblastoma and would be too aggressive for this condition.
- Subtenon triamcinolone (C) would add more steroids, which is problematic given the patient's suspected steroid response.
- Switching from ibuprofen to flurbiprofen (D) is unlikely to provide significant additional benefit, as the current anti-inflammatory regimen has already proven ineffective.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Limited joint mobility and the prayer sign can be seen in systemic sclerosis (choice B).2 However, the negative ANA test results and the absence of Raynaud phenomenon, sclerodactyly, and internal organ involvement helped exclude systemic sclerosis.3 Limited mobility of joints, peripheral eosinophilia, and increased ESR and CRP can be found in deep morphea (choice C), a rare subtype of morphea that primarily involves the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue and may extend to underlying fascia and muscle.4 Nevertheless, the symmetrical distribution of joint involvement, histology displaying preferential fascial inflammation (Figure 2), and the absence of sclerotic skin plaque in this patient point to the diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) over deep morphea.Inflammatory cell infiltrate composed primarily of lymphocytes and eosinophils (arrowheads) in the fascia (hematoxylin and eosin stain).EF is a rare disorder characterized by the induration of fascia and skin, preceded by the abrupt onset of erythema and nonpitting edema, resulting in limited mobility of the underlying joints.3 The disease can have an insidious onset.5 The appearance of orange peel caused by skin induration and the groove sign, which is probably due to the relative sparing of the epidermis and superficial dermis by the fibrotic process, are typical signs of established EF.3 Occasionally, EF can present without skin involvement.6,7 Sclerodactyly and Raynaud phenomenon are usually absent. Laboratory findings of EF include peripheral eosinophilia, increased ESR and CRP level, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and negative ANA test results.3 The results of biopsy containing skin, fascia, and muscle conducted at the left gastrocnemius of this patient showed inflammatory cell infiltrate mainly in the fascia (composed primarily of lymphocytes and eosinophils) (Figure 2) and some subjacent endomysium and perimysium, but they were minimal in the skin. There were moderate variations in muscle fiber size. Some muscle fibers were atrophic. A scatter of necrotic muscle fibers was seen. The myositis, which is frequently observed in EF, may explain the EMG findings in this patient, as myotonic discharges may be seen in a number of acquired myopathic disorders, including myositis.1 Also, certain drugs (eg, statins) can cause myotonic discharges.1 The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of EF.The etiology and exact incidence of EF remain unknown. A variety of etiological factors have been proposed, such as strenuous exercise or trauma preceding disease onset.8 To our knowledge, no randomized trials have evaluated therapies for EF. Usually, treatment is started with systemic glucocorticoids at doses equivalent to prednisone, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day.8 Concomitant immunosuppressants (eg, methotrexate) are used by some practitioners as the initial therapy or when patients are steroid resistant or refractory.8,9 For this patient, prednisone and cyclophosphamide were prescribed. Nine months later, his joint mobility was improved. Diagnosing EF is challenging because of its rarity.

[Explanation]
The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF). This conclusion is based on several key clinical features and laboratory findings presented in the case:

1. Joint mobility limitations: The patient presents with progressive limitation of joint mobility, affecting multiple joints in both upper and lower extremities. This is a characteristic feature of EF.

2. Prayer sign and groove sign: These are pathognomonic signs of EF. The prayer sign indicates the inability to fully appose the palms due to skin tightening, while the groove sign (linear depression along superficial veins when the limb is elevated) is highly suggestive of fasciitis.

3. Eosinophilia: The patient's blood test shows an elevated eosinophil count (1300 μL), which is a hallmark of EF.

4. Elevated inflammatory markers: Increased ESR and CRP levels indicate an ongoing inflammatory process, consistent with EF.

5. Absence of skin changes: The lack of skin involvement (no erythema, edema, or sclerotic skin plaques) helps differentiate EF from other scleroderma-like disorders.

6. EMG findings: The presence of spontaneous activities in muscles, including fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves, suggests muscle involvement, which can occur in EF due to inflammation of the fascia.

7. Normal imaging and other tests: The absence of significant findings on radiographs, MRI, and normal ANA levels help rule out other conditions like systemic sclerosis or deep morphea.

While myotonic dystrophy (option B) could explain some of the EMG findings, it doesn't account for the eosinophilia or the characteristic skin signs. Systemic sclerosis (option D) typically involves skin changes and Raynaud's phenomenon, which are absent here. Deep morphea (option C) usually presents with localized skin induration, which is not described in this case.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, characteristic signs, and laboratory findings, eosinophilic fasciitis is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

</options>",6.7487242221832275,"content=""(Answer - A)\n\n[Explanation]\nThe most likely diagnosis for this patient is Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF). This conclusion is based on several key clinical features and laboratory findings presented in the case:\n\n1. Joint mobility limitations: The patient presents with progressive limitation of joint mobility, affecting multiple joints in both upper and lower extremities. This is a characteristic feature of EF.\n\n2. Prayer sign and groove sign: These are pathognomonic signs of EF. The prayer sign indicates the inability to fully appose the palms due to skin tightening, while the groove sign (linear depression along superficial veins when the limb is elevated) is highly suggestive of fasciitis.\n\n3. Eosinophilia: The patient's blood test shows an elevated eosinophil count (1300 μL), which is a hallmark of EF.\n\n4. Elevated inflammatory markers: Increased ESR and CRP levels indicate an ongoing inflammatory process, consistent with EF.\n\n5. Absence of skin changes: The lack of skin involvement (no erythema, edema, or sclerotic skin plaques) helps differentiate EF from other scleroderma-like disorders.\n\n6. EMG findings: The presence of spontaneous activities in muscles, including fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves, suggests muscle involvement, which can occur in EF due to inflammation of the fascia.\n\n7. Normal imaging and other tests: The absence of significant findings on radiographs, MRI, and normal ANA levels help rule out other conditions like systemic sclerosis or deep morphea.\n\nWhile myotonic dystrophy (option B) could explain some of the EMG findings, it doesn't account for the eosinophilia or the characteristic skin signs. Systemic sclerosis (option D) typically involves skin changes and Raynaud's phenomenon, which are absent here. Deep morphea (option C) usually presents with localized skin induration, which is not described in this case.\n\nTherefore, based on the clinical presentation, characteristic signs, and laboratory findings, eosinophilic fasciitis is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient."" response_metadata={'id': 'msg_vrtx_01JA6qdrC2efcsaNmgby6V9t', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 840, 'output_tokens': 484}} id='run-e444cabd-55c2-4a5e-871d-5120d0b03439-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 840, 'output_tokens': 484, 'total_tokens': 1324}",0.0

This presentation—recurrent retrobulbar hemorrhage associated with orbital mass effect over several weeks and restriction in upgaze—suggests an orbital tumor history but is not specific enough to eliminate an orbital vascular anomaly. At this stage, scheduling a follow-up without further investigation is not acceptable.MRI is needed to differentiate between a vascular or tissular lesion. The isointensity of the lesion in T1- and T2-weighted images (Figure 1) is in favor of a tissular lesion; a vascular or cystic lesion would be hyperintense on T2-weighted images.3 These findings support a retrobulbar tumor surrounding the optic nerve.Additional imaging is needed for disease staging and treatment planning. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the orbital region can show bony involvement (osteolysis), which, if present, can help in surgical planning.4 CT imaging of the cranial, neck, thoracic, and abdominal regions can show primary disease or metastasis. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can assess the metabolic uptake of the orbital lesion and is more sensitive than CT imaging in cancer staging.5 Angiography is not helpful as an initial imaging modality; orbital vascular anomalies are unlikely owing to the tissuelike aspect of the lesion.In this case, CT imaging showed no osteolysis, and PET imaging revealed hypermetabolism of the orbital tumor without the presence of other hypermetabolic lesions. An inferior transconjunctival orbital biopsy was performed. Histologic examination confirmed a primary melanoma. This biopsy should be done after cancer-staging imaging so as not to miss another, more accessible site of biopsy.6Nonmetastatic malignant melanoma treatment involves complete surgical removal with safety margins. Evisceration or enucleation were not an option in this patient as the tumor was primarily intraorbital and not intraocular. Ultimately, eyelid-sparing exenteration was performed, followed by radiotherapy. The macroscopic aspect of the tumor is shown in Figure 2. The primary meningeal melanoma originated in the optic nerve, developed in the posterior orbit, and infiltrated the oculomotor muscles, orbital fat, and sclera without intraocular extension.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and the recurrent nature of the retrobulbar hemorrhage, a transconjunctival orbital biopsy (option A) is the most appropriate next step.

The patient has experienced two episodes of acute, painless proptosis with associated retrobulbar hemorrhage, which resolved partially with corticosteroid treatment. The persistent mild proptosis and extraocular movement limitation in upgaze, along with the MRI findings of an intraorbital lesion, strongly suggest an underlying orbital mass.

A biopsy is crucial in this case for several reasons:

1. Definitive diagnosis: The recurrent nature of the hemorrhage and the presence of an intraorbital lesion on MRI indicate that this is not a simple idiopathic retrobulbar hemorrhage. A biopsy will provide a definitive diagnosis of the underlying pathology.

2. Rule out malignancy: Given the patient's age and the progressive nature of the condition, it's essential to rule out orbital tumors, including potential malignancies.

3. Guide treatment: The biopsy results will inform the most appropriate treatment plan, whether it's surgical intervention, targeted therapy, or continued observation.

4. Avoid delay in diagnosis: Opting for clinical follow-up (option B) or further imaging studies (options C and D) without a biopsy could delay the diagnosis and potentially allow progression of an underlying condition.

While arteriography (option C) could be considered to evaluate vascular malformations, the clinical presentation and MRI findings suggest a solid lesion rather than a purely vascular abnormality. Additional imaging (option D) is less likely to provide definitive diagnosis compared to a biopsy.

In conclusion, a transconjunctival orbital biopsy is the most appropriate next step to establish a diagnosis and guide further management in this case of recurrent retrobulbar hemorrhage with an underlying orbital lesion.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Careful slitlamp examination showed a slowly mobile nematode coiled under the bulbar conjunctiva. No nematode was visible in the anterior chamber, vitreous, or retina. The organism was suspected to have migrated from the eyelid, likely the site of inoculation, into the subconjunctival space. Combined with the patient’s recent travel from Moldova, these findings raised suspicion for a parasitic infection with Dirofilaria species endemic in Moldova.1 After injection of subconjunctival lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine to paralyze the nematode, a small conjunctival incision was made, and the worm was removed intact using forceps.2 Pathological examination demonstrated an 11.8-cm-long nematode with a maximum diameter of 0.5 mm and tapered ends (Figure 2). Transverse sections showed a multilayered cuticle with external longitudinal ridges approximately 7 μm wide with 11 μm between ridges, morphological features characteristic of Dirofilaria repens.3The nematode was 11.8-cm-long with a maximum diameter of 0.5 mm and tapered ends.

Answer A is the treatment for conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia, which presents as a gelatinous or plaque-like lesion, often with a feeder vessel. Answer C is the initial management for conjunctival lymphoma, which presents with a salmon-pink patch. Answer D is a treatment for nodular scleritis, which presents with dilated scleral vessels and firm, tender nodule(s). Subconjunctival dirofilariasis must be distinguished from nodular scleritis, which it may mimic.4 None of the alternate diagnoses would present with eyelid involvement.D repens is a zoonotic infection that resides in canine and feline hosts. Microfilariae are transmitted via mosquitos to humans, where they evolve into adult helminths. Dirofilariasis may involve ocular and periocular tissues, including the eyelids, orbit, subconjunctival space, anterior chamber, and vitreous.4 Subcutaneous dirofilariasis causes local irritation and pruritus, and visual symptoms of ocular involvement are typically mild. If left untreated, D repens can survive for up to 1.5 years; a severe local or systemic reaction may rarely occur.5 Because adult helminths are reproductively inactive and affect a single location, no systemic treatment is necessary after removal.6 In a report of 60 cases, D repens was shown to be a single-organism disease.7 This is in contrast to Dirofilaria immitis and Loa loa, which require systemic antihelminthic treatment.8,9 Although the role of topical medications is unclear, this patient received erythromycin ointment twice daily for 1 week, aimed to provide comfort and prevent secondary infection. Given minimal local inflammation present, topical steroids were deemed unnecessary after removal.Cases of dirofilariasis have been reported primarily in Eastern and Southern Europe, less commonly in Southeast Asia and Africa. Increasing global temperatures are thought to contribute to the rising incidence of dirofilariasis in more Northern climates, including the US.4,10The patient’s symptoms resolved by postoperative day 6 after surgical removal, with no residual nematode found.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and history provided, the most appropriate next step would be to inject subconjunctival lidocaine followed by surgical removal of the lesion (Option B).

The patient's clinical presentation strongly suggests a parasitic infection, most likely ocular dirofilariasis caused by Dirofilaria repens. This conclusion is supported by several key factors:

1. The initial vermiform (worm-like) appearance of the eyelid lesion.
2. The subsequent development of a cystic elevation in the bulbar conjunctiva with whitish linear opacities, which likely represents the migrated parasite.
3. The patient's recent immigration from Moldova, a region where Dirofilaria repens is endemic.
4. Her history of exposure to farm animals, particularly dogs and cats, which are common hosts for this parasite.

In cases of suspected ocular dirofilariasis, the recommended treatment is surgical removal of the worm. This approach serves both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes:

1. It allows for definitive identification of the parasite through microscopic examination.
2. It provides immediate and complete treatment by removing the causative agent.
3. It prevents further migration of the worm, which could lead to more severe complications.

Subconjunctival lidocaine injection prior to removal ensures patient comfort during the procedure and may help immobilize the worm, facilitating its extraction.

Other options are less appropriate:
- Option A (biopsy) is unnecessary and may not completely remove the parasite.
- Option C (NSAIDs and corticosteroids) would not address the underlying cause and could potentially worsen the condition by suppressing the immune response.
- Option D (cryotherapy and interferon) is more suited for treating certain ocular surface neoplasms rather than parasitic infections.

Therefore, surgical removal following local anesthesia is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Lastly, although the history of transient contralateral ptosis may be reminiscent of myasthenia gravis, the lack of fatiguability, normal ice-pack test results, and soft tissue changes on magnetic resonance imaging suggest an alternate etiology.Temporal artery biopsy was obtained demonstrating intimal hyperplasia and transmural inflammation with giant cells (Figure 2), consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is classically thought to affect large and medium-sized arteries, although recent definitions reflect the capacity of GCA to affect vessels of any size.1 Most patients with ocular GCA present with acute vision loss, with 80% attributable to arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy owing to ischemia of the posterior ciliary arteries.2Histopathologic photograph of a temporal artery biopsy specimen. High-power image (original magnification ×200) shows granulomatous inflammation with giant cells (asterisk), transmural inflammation, intimal hyperplasia, and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina (arrowheads) with elastic Verhoeff–Van Gieson stain.Case series of GCA have demonstrated that although approximately 5% to 15% of patients report diplopia, only a subset have demonstrable oculomotor deficits on presentation, suggesting that ophthalmoplegia may be transient and underreported.2-4 There are 2 proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms for ophthalmoplegia in GCA. The first is arteritic involvement of the vasa nervorum of the ocular motor nerves. However, ocular motility deficits in GCA often do not conform to the pattern of a cranial nerve. The second is arteritis of the vascular supply of the extraocular muscles. Despite the rich anastomotic vasculature from both the ophthalmic artery and branches of the external carotid artery, ischemia of the extraocular muscles has been observed. A histopathologic survey of the entire ocular motor apparatus in a case of GCA with severe ophthalmoparesis demonstrated extraocular muscle ischemia with preservation of cranial nerves 3, 4, and 6 along their entire course from the nerve nuclei to the orbits.5Ptosis associated with ophthalmoplegia in GCA may be attributable to similar mechanisms.4 Ptosis has also been reported in relation to Horner syndrome secondary to vasculitis affecting the vasa nervorum supplying the sympathetic plexus or direct granulomatous involvement of the sympathetic nerve fibers as they run alongside the inflamed vessel wall of the cavernous internal carotid artery.6,7This patient had ocular motility deficits and ptosis that did not conform to the pattern of the ocular motor nerves and had no other signs of Horner syndrome. There was no ataxia or hemiparesis on examination, and magnetic resonance imaging ruled out a brainstem infarct. Her presentation was most suggestive of vasculitis leading to ischemia of the periorbital musculature. The patient promptly received high-dose intravenous steroids, which led to symptomatic improvement within hours.This case demonstrates the multifaceted presentation of GCA and the importance of maintaining a high suspicion in patients with elevated inflammatory markers, headache, and uncommon neuro-ophthalmic symptoms. When ocular motility abnormalities do not correspond to a typical ocular motor nerve palsy, ischemic myopathy should be considered, and prompt treatment with corticosteroids should be initiated to prevent vision loss and complications from GCA.",Neurology,2022-07-01,2022,7,"A 75-year-old woman presented with horizontal binocular diplopia, right-sided ptosis, and a new headache that was progressive over 3 days.

[Explanation]
The most likely diagnosis for this 75-year-old woman is Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA). Several key features of the clinical presentation support this diagnosis:

1. Age and demographics: GCA typically affects individuals over 50 years old, with a higher prevalence in women, which matches our patient's profile.

2. Symptoms:
   - New-onset headache: A hallmark symptom of GCA.
   - Jaw claudication (difficulty opening jaw, pain when chewing): Highly specific for GCA.
   - Weight loss: A common systemic symptom in GCA.
   - Diplopia and ptosis: Can occur due to involvement of the ophthalmic artery or its branches.

3. Laboratory findings:
   - Markedly elevated C-reactive protein (292 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (93 mm/h): Typical inflammatory markers elevated in GCA.

4. Imaging findings:
   - MRI showing diffuse edema and enhancement of the scalp, skull base, neck, and paraspinal soft tissues: Consistent with the widespread vascular inflammation seen in GCA.

5. Fluctuating symptoms:
   - The patient experienced left-sided ptosis that resolved and then developed right-sided ptosis, which is consistent with the sometimes relapsing-remitting nature of GCA.

While the other options have some overlapping features, they don't fit as well:
- Anti-tRNA synthetase myositis typically presents with more prominent muscle weakness and myalgias.
- Myasthenia gravis would typically show fatiguability and improvement with rest or ice pack test, which was not observed here.
- IgG4-related disease can affect multiple organs but doesn't typically present with such prominent inflammatory markers and the specific symptoms described.

Given the combination of age, typical symptoms (especially jaw claudication), markedly elevated inflammatory markers, and imaging findings, Giant Cell Arteritis is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Patients with nanophthalmos have an increased risk of developing acute angle-closure glaucoma, retinal detachment, and intraretinal cysts (Figure 2).2 The schisislike cystoid thickening of the retina has been proposed to arise from crowding of the retina and uveal tissues and poor outflow through the characteristically thickened sclera. Although literature on the angiographic characterization of this phenomenon is limited, fundus autofluorescence is not expected to show leakage surrounding these spaces.5,6Nanophthalmos can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive fashion or from sporadic genetic derangements that interfere with the normal formation of the optic cup.1,2 Depending on the presence of ocular and systemic manifestations, nanophthalmos can be isolated, complex, or syndromic.2,7 The gene most implicated with nanophthalmos is the membrane-type frizzled-related protein gene (MFRP), also associated with retinal dystrophy.2,3﻿ MFRP encodes for a transmembrane protein highly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium and ciliary body and plays an important role in eye development prenatally and postnatally, with the only progressive change mentioned in the literature being amblyopia when axial hyperopia is left untreated in nanophthalmos.1The genetic etiology of the severe hyperopia in this patient remained unrecognized until he was referred to a pediatric retina specialist to rule out retinitis pigmentosa. At that point, the patient had considerable posterior segment involvement causing abnormal foveal and papillomacular folds, retinal pigment epithelium mottling (Figure 1), and intraretinal cysts (Figure 2). This constellation of findings along with axial lengths of 17.8 mm in the right eye and 17.7 mm in the left eye triggered genetic testing.Genetics for ocular diseases (B) is the correct answer because other conditions have similar presentation to nanophthalmos, making genetic testing the more certain way to diagnose it. If no mutation is found, this can also help rule out similar-appearing ocular genetic diseases.Although B-scan ultrasonography (A) would be helpful to confirm decreased axial length, suggestive of nanophthalmos,8 it does not provide enough information to rule out other diseases or confirm the diagnosis. Observation (C) alone is not appropriate. Although the findings suggest nanophthalmos, further investigation is needed to diagnose the condition, provide treatment as necessary, and be aware of potential complications. Finally, fundus autofluorescence (D) would likely show macular changes associated with the cystoid retinal thickening; however, it would not be enough to make a definitive diagnosis, and genetic testing would still be necessary.2This patient underwent genetic testing revealing 2 pathogenic variants in the MFRP gene, confirming the diagnosis of autosomal recessive nanophthalmos and retinal dystrophy.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation of this 9-year-old boy, genetic testing to assess for ocular diseases is the most appropriate next step. Here's why:

1. Complex ocular findings: The patient presents with multiple ocular abnormalities, including high hyperopia, amblyopia, abnormal foveal contour, blunted foveal reflexes, abnormal vasculature, and retinal pigment epithelium changes. This constellation of findings suggests a possible genetic etiology.

2. Early onset: The abnormal foveal contour was discovered at age 3, indicating an early-onset condition, which is often associated with genetic disorders.

3. Bilateral involvement: The fluorescein angiography and color fundus photography show symmetric bilateral changes, which is characteristic of many genetic retinal disorders.

4. Structural abnormalities: The spectral-domain optical coherence tomography reveals structural changes in the fovea, including loss of the foveal pit and intraretinal cystoid cavities. These findings are consistent with various inherited retinal dystrophies.

5. Exclusion of other options:
   - B-scan ultrasonography (Option A) is typically used for posterior segment evaluation when direct visualization is difficult, which is not the case here.
   - Fundus autofluorescence (Option B) could provide additional information but is less likely to lead to a definitive diagnosis compared to genetic testing.
   - Observation (Option D) is not appropriate given the complexity and progression of the condition.

Genetic testing can help identify specific gene mutations associated with various retinal disorders, such as familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, Stargardt disease, or other macular dystrophies. This information can provide a definitive diagnosis, guide prognosis, inform genetic counseling, and potentially direct future treatment options as gene therapies become available for specific conditions.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor that has antiangiogenic effects via regulation of cellular growth and proliferation pathways, is a viable treatment option for infantile hemangioma that has increasingly been used to treat refractory hemangiomas with success.1-6Infantile hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor occurring in 5% of infants worldwide.7 These endothelial cells are characterized by rapid proliferation in the first 3 months of life followed by slow involution.7 Infantile hemangiomas are differentiated from other vascular tumors by their clinical course and glucose transporter 1 positivity.8 While many infantile hemangiomas require only observation, medical treatment is recommended for eyelid or orbit hemangiomas that cause visually significant ptosis, strabismus, astigmatism, and amblyopia.7Propranolol is the first-line therapy for infantile hemangiomas; its mechanism of action likely involves vasoconstriction and downregulation of angiogenic growth.7,8 In an American Academy of Pediatrics meta-analysis, mean clearance of infantile hemangiomas was 95% with propanolol.7For infantile hemangiomas refractory to propranolol, other treatment options may be considered.9 Steroids, previously the criterion standard, are indicated in cases where propranolol is ineffective or contraindicated. Prednisolone or prednisone can be given orally or by intralesional injection for well-localized lesions.

A stage 2 clinical trial10 demonstrated efficacy of sirolimus in treating vascular anomalies, and further trials are under way.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate next step would be to initiate oral sirolimus (Option B). Here's the medical explanation for this decision:

1. Failed previous treatments: The patient has already undergone multiple treatments without significant success. Propranolol, topical timolol, and oral prednisolone have been tried with limited or unsustainable results. Additionally, two embolization and debulking procedures have been performed, but the lesion persists.

2. Complexity of the lesion: The infantile hemangioma is complex, involving the orbit, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. It's causing significant complications, including amblyopia, strabismus (esotropia and hypertropia), and proptosis. The MRI shows persistent orbital involvement with mass effect on the globe.

3. Sirolimus efficacy: Sirolimus (rapamycin) is an mTOR inhibitor that has shown promising results in treating complex vascular anomalies, including infantile hemangiomas. It works by inhibiting cell proliferation and angiogenesis, which are key processes in hemangioma growth.

Please analyze the following clinical case and the related question:

<clinical_case>
A 3-year-old boy presented with a vascular lesion involving the left orbit and face. He had a pink macule on his left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. He was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek.Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, he presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle showed inability to abduct past midline (Figure 1A). A repeated magnetic resonance image showed persistent orbital involvement causing medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle and mass effect on the globe (Figure 1B).Infantile hemangioma prior to treatment.

Here's the medical explanation for this decision:\n\n1. Failed previous treatments: The patient has already undergone multiple treatments without significant success. Propranolol, topical timolol, and oral prednisolone have been tried with limited or unsustainable results. Additionally, two embolization and debulking procedures have been performed, but the lesion persists.\n\n2. Complexity of the lesion: The infantile hemangioma is complex, involving the orbit, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. It's causing significant complications, including amblyopia, strabismus (esotropia and hypertropia), and proptosis. The MRI shows persistent orbital involvement with mass effect on the globe.\n\n3. Sirolimus efficacy: Sirolimus (rapamycin) is an mTOR inhibitor that has shown promising results in treating complex vascular anomalies, including infantile hemangiomas. It works by inhibiting cell proliferation and angiogenesis, which are key processes in hemangioma growth.\n\n4. Systemic approach: Given the extensive nature of the lesion, a systemic treatment like sirolimus is more likely to address all components of the hemangioma, including the deeper orbital and pterygopalatine fossa involvement that may be difficult to treat with local therapies.\n\n5.

Pituitary apoplexy,C,Pituitary apoplexy,"Based on the acute presentation of symptoms and signs starting immediately after surgery and change in the appearance of tumor on MRI (loss of central enhancement), a diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy was made. The ophthalmoplegia in ocular motor apraxia can be overcome with vestibular ocular reflex, which was not the case here. The absence of exophthalmos and normal intraocular pressure argue against the diagnosis of orbital compartment syndrome. Imaging does not support the diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis.Pituitary apoplexy is an acute-onset syndrome due to hemorrhaging and/or infarction of the pituitary gland. Postoperative pituitary apoplexy has been reported after cardiac surgery, abdominal surgery, thyroidectomy, laparoscopic lumbar spinal fusion, and knee arthroplasty.1 Risk factors proposed during surgery that could lead to pituitary apoplexy include prolonged mechanical ventilation, embolization, unstable blood pressure, anticoagulation, crystalloid hemodilution, previous treatment with dopamine agonists, and radiotherapy.2Patients with pituitary apoplexy typically present with headaches. Cranial nerve palsies leading to ophthalmoplegia have been reported in about 50% of patients during pituitary apoplexy.1 Sixty-four percent of patients can have vision loss from worsening chiasmal compression, which fortunately this patient did not have.3 Early neuroimaging study is important to confirm the suspicion of pituitary apoplexy, along with urgent pituitary function tests. Computed tomography scan is often the first study performed in an acute setting and may demonstrate a variably hyperdense mass of the sella and suprasellar region in the presence of hemorrhage. MRI is the preferred study of choice with sensitivity of about 90%.4 Appearance of hemorrhagic pituitary apoplexy on MRI depends on the sequence and stage of hemorrhage. In the acute phase, hemorrhage is usually hypotense on T2-weighted imaging because of the presence of deoxyhemoglobin, which was not present in the present patient. Infarctive pituitary apoplexy alone, which is a rarer presentation of pituitary apoplexy, has low signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted sequences and no contrast enhancement of the tumor as seen in this patient. It may have associated rim enhancement.5Pituitary apoplexy is a vision- and life-threatening neuro-ophthalmic emergency. Before the use of corticosteroids, mortality rates were reported to be as high as 50% because of acute adrenal insufficiency that many of these patients develop. Treatment involves urgent administration of steroids, endocrine evaluation, and urgent surgical intervention for prompt decompression based on severity of presentation.Visual recovery, with or without sequelae, is variable depending on the severity and duration of compression of the optic nerve apparatus. Ophthalmoplegia resolves in the majority of patients, but some patients can have incomplete recovery.6,7The patient immediately started receiving intravenous corticosteroids under the guidance of endocrinology and neurosurgery. He was monitored for any endocrine deficiencies while inpatient. After no improvement in extraocular movements were noted over 5 days, the patient underwent transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumor. Pathological evaluation of the tumor confirmed a pituitary adenoma with areas of necrosis consistent with pituitary apoplexy.Postoperative MRI showed successful resection of the large pituitary macroadenoma, with decompression of the optic chiasm. There was some residual tumor in the bilateral cavernous sinuses, basisphenoid, and along the dorsum sella.One year after surgery, the patient’s visual acuity was 20/20 OU with normal color vision. Bilateral ptosis had resolved. Extraocular movements were full and the eyes were well aligned. However, the pupils remained unresponsive to light and accommodation.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate diagnosis for this case is pituitary apoplexy. This conclusion is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation and imaging findings:

1. Pre-existing pituitary mass: The patient had a known enhancing central skull base lesion in the sella turcica, initially thought to be a pituitary macroadenoma.

2. Acute onset of symptoms: The patient developed sudden symptoms immediately after a long surgical procedure, which is characteristic of pituitary apoplexy. The acute nature of the symptoms rules out a slowly progressive condition.

3. Constellation of symptoms: The patient presented with headache, facial numbness, bilateral ptosis, and complete ophthalmoplegia (inability to move both eyes in any direction). This combination of symptoms is highly suggestive of pituitary apoplexy, as it affects multiple cranial nerves (CN III, IV, V, and VI) due to the expansion of the pituitary gland compressing surrounding structures.

4. Imaging changes: The MRI findings are crucial in confirming the diagnosis. The comparison between pre- and post-symptom onset MRI shows:
   a. Increase in tumor size (from 4.9 × 4.6 × 5.2 cm to 5.3 × 5.1 × 5.3 cm)
   b. Loss of central enhancement in the post-symptom MRI
   c. Hyperintensity on T2-weighted images

These imaging changes are consistent with hemorrhage or infarction within the pituitary tumor, which are hallmarks of pituitary apoplexy.

5. Precipitating factor: The long surgical procedure (8.5-hour robotic cystectomy) could have acted as a precipitating factor for pituitary apoplexy, as major surgeries can sometimes trigger this condition due to changes in blood flow or stress on the body.

Pituitary apoplexy is a medical emergency characterized by the sudden expansion of a pituitary tumor due to hemorrhage or infarction. The rapid expansion causes compression of surrounding structures, leading to the observed symptoms. The diagnosis is supported by the acute onset, characteristic symptoms, and confirmatory MRI findings showing tumor expansion and signal changes consistent with hemorrhage or infarction.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Most of these genes encode for lysosomal proteins. It is hypothesized that tissues with high mitochondrial turnover are the most affected, such as the retina and optic nerve.5,6 There is no approved treatment for most types of NCL, but several are under investigation.4Most patients do not present with neurodegenerative symptoms early on, making NCL a challenging diagnosis.4 Keeping NCL in the differential diagnosis for retinal dystrophies can lead to a timely diagnosis and optimize patient outcomes, as these patients benefit from early multidisciplinary care, family education, and close neuropsychiatric management. For this reason, it is key to differentiate it from Stargardt disease early on, which also presents with vision loss and macular dystrophy in children but has a more gradual progression and no neuropsychiatric symptoms.7This patient’s history of progression from a BCVA of 20/70 to light perception in 2 years, the neurological abnormalities, and imaging findings led to the consideration of NCL over Stargardt disease. Progressive vision loss in young children can be seen in conditions including intracerebral tumors, optic neuropathies, and retinal dystrophies. However, children with NCL present with characteristically rapid progression to complete vision loss within 2 to 3 years of onset. While rapidly progressive decline in BCVA is not a diagnostic criterion for NCL, it can be useful in differentiating it from other entities. Progression to complete vision loss in children with early-onset Stargardt can take more than 10 years, in contrast with 2 to 3 years in NCL.8 NCL also presents with early-onset retinal thinning, ellipsoid zone loss, optic nerve pallor, and attenuated vasculature, which are all present in this patient (Figure 2) and are not common in retinal dystrophies.6Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography of the left eye showing decreased retinal thickness, complete loss of the ellipsoid zone (white arrowheads), and hyperreflective dots in the outer retinal layers (blue arrowheads).Early on, when NCL can be misdiagnosed as Stargardt, an electroretinogram (choice A) could prove useful.8 In NCL, electroretinograms generally show profound loss of amplitude at presentation with an electronegative configuration, particularly under scotopic conditions, whereas Stargardt disease shows a near-normal panretinal cone and rod function.7 Once neurodegeneration is noticeable, a diagnosis of NCL is favored, and genetic testing (choice B) is necessary for confirmation.4 Observation alone (choice C) is not appropriate; family engagement with timely management is essential.4 Genetic testing is highly specific and noninvasive and has largely replaced muscle biopsy (choice D), which is nowadays only done in areas where molecular testing is not available.9Genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of CLN3 NCL, and the patient was referred to a clinic specializing in NCL.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and findings, genetic testing would be the most appropriate next step for this patient. Here's why:

1. Progressive vision loss: The patient has experienced rapid and severe vision loss over a short period, progressing from 20/70 to light perception in both eyes within two years. This suggests a genetic or metabolic disorder affecting the retina.

2. Retinal findings: The fundus autofluorescence and color fundus photography show significant retinal abnormalities, including attenuated vasculature, optic disc pallor, and retinal atrophy. These findings are consistent with various inherited retinal dystrophies.

3. Nyctalopia: The patient's history of night blindness (nyctalopia) is a common symptom in many inherited retinal disorders.

4. Neurological involvement: The patient's poor mentation and inability to recall simple information suggest potential neurological involvement, which can be associated with certain genetic syndromes affecting both the retina and the central nervous system.

5. Family history: The unilateral vision loss in the paternal grandmother, although not definitively related, suggests a possible genetic component.

6. Age of onset: The early onset of symptoms, possibly dating back to infancy (given the history of neonatal seizures), is indicative of a genetic condition.

Genetic testing would help identify the specific gene mutation responsible for the patient's condition, which could:
- Provide a definitive diagnosis
- Guide potential treatment options or clinical trials
- Offer prognostic information
- Allow for genetic counseling for the family
- Help in identifying potential systemic associations that may require monitoring or management

While an electroretinogram (ERG) could provide functional information about the retina, genetic testing would offer more comprehensive and specific information about the underlying cause of the patient's condition, making it the most appropriate next step in this case.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Progressive vision loss: The patient has experienced rapid and severe vision loss over a short period, progressing from 20/70 to light perception in both eyes within two years. This suggests a genetic or metabolic disorder affecting the retina.\n\n2. Retinal findings: The fundus autofluorescence and color fundus photography show significant retinal abnormalities, including attenuated vasculature, optic disc pallor, and retinal atrophy. These findings are consistent with various inherited retinal dystrophies.\n\n3. Nyctalopia: The patient's history of night blindness (nyctalopia) is a common symptom in many inherited retinal disorders.\n\n4. Neurological involvement: The patient's poor mentation and inability to recall simple information suggest potential neurological involvement, which can be associated with certain genetic syndromes affecting both the retina and the central nervous system.\n\n5. Family history: The unilateral vision loss in the paternal grandmother, although not definitively related, suggests a possible genetic component.\n\n6. Age of onset: The early onset of symptoms, possibly dating back to infancy (given the history of neonatal seizures), is indicative of a genetic condition.\n\nGenetic testing would help identify the specific gene mutation responsible for the patient's condition, which could:\n- Provide a definitive diagnosis\n- Guide potential treatment options or clinical trials\n- Offer prognostic information\n- Allow for genetic counseling for the family\n- Help in identifying potential systemic associations that may require monitoring or management\n\nWhile an electroretinogram (ERG) could provide functional information about the retina, genetic testing would offer more comprehensive and specific information about the underlying cause of the patient's condition, making it the most appropriate next step in this case."" response_metadata={'id': 'msg_vrtx_016yyAt7nrHx9EdAC86bnfkg', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 728, 'output_tokens': 420}} id='run-81c9e955-75ab-40ca-905b-559210e797c9-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 728, 'output_tokens': 420, 'total_tokens': 1148}",1.0

Continuing intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (choice A) is unlikely to be beneficial because the SRF was refractory to 32 anti-VEGF treatments, and lack of drusen suggest a diagnosis other than exudative age-related macular degeneration. Photodynamic therapy (choice B) is not recommended as the next step because choroidal atrophy and lack of leakage on the angiogram are not consistent with central serous chorioretinopathy. An electrooculogram and molecular genetic testing (choice C) is expected to be negative because a diagnosis of Best disease is improbable given the patient’s age at diagnosis.Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation test revealed an IgG κ monoclonal protein spike. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with the monoclonal gammopathy, IgG κ smoldering multiple myeloma.Monoclonal gammopathy describes a spectrum of conditions in which abnormal proteins (paraproteins), derived from clonal B lymphocytes or plasma cells, are identified in the blood. The most common monoclonal gammopathy is monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The potential for malignant conversion of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to multiple myeloma or another lymphoproliferative disorder is 1% per year.1 Smoldering multiple myeloma is an intermediate stage between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and multiple myeloma. The risk of smoldering multiple myeloma progressing to multiple myeloma is estimated at about 10% per year for the first 5 years.1The ocular presentations of monoclonal gammopathies include conjunctival and corneal deposits, uveal cysts, venous stasis retinopathy, and serous retinal and pigment epithelial detachments.2 Most retinal manifestations of gammopathies are a consequence of serum hyperviscosity.3 Hyperviscosity is seen in Waldenstroms macroglobulemia and some multiple myelomas, secondary to elevated concentrations of circulating immunoglobulins.2 Accordingly, because this patient had lower levels of circulating immunoglobulins, she was not expected to exhibit signs of venous stasis and hyperviscosity was not a plausible mechanism for the PEDs and neurosensory retinal detachments.It has been postulated that a preexisting dysfunction of the blood-retina barrier or activation of the neonatal Fc receptor protein that exist in retinal pigment epithelium cells may promote the subretinal accumulation of immunoglobulins.3-5 These immunoglobulins facilitate transudation of fluid across the retinal pigment epithelium. PEDs have also been previously described in paraproteinemias. It has been suggested that these PEDs are consequent to the increased capillary permeability resulting from small-vessel occlusion of the choriocapillaris with immunoglobulins.3,4,6Currently there are no proven treatments or guidelines on surveillance frequency for immunogammopathy-associated maculopathy. Photodynamic therapy, intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and eplerenone failed to show efficacy in case reports.3,6 For patients who have progressed to multiple myeloma, treatment aimed at decreasing serum immunoglobulins has shown some promise.3,6,7 Any resolution of the SRF is likely to be slow because the SRF is expected to be proteinaceous and the retinal pigment epithelium dysfunctional.3 Treatment is not indicated for smoldering multiple myeloma.Especially given the risk of malignant transformation, this case illustrates the importance of considering an alternative diagnosis when encountering an atypical presentation or refractory case of a classic condition such as age-related macular degeneration. The typical features of immunogammopathy-associated maculopathy without hyperviscosity include refractory SRF, angiographic silence, and the presence of vitelliform deposits.3,5-7 These findings typically warrant systemic evaluation including serum protein electrophoresis.Because treatment is not available, the present patient received no systemic therapy. Her anti-VEGF treatments were discontinued. Nine months later, the maculopathy and her visual acuity remained stable in each eye. Owing to the paucity of data in the literature, her visual prognosis is uncertain.",Ophthalmology,2022-05-01,2022,5,"An 88-year-old woman presented with persistent subretinal fluid (SRF) and enlarging pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) in each eye following 32 near monthly injections of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an electrooculogram (EOG) and molecular genetic testing (Option B). This decision is supported by several key factors in the case:

1. Persistent subretinal fluid (SRF) and enlarging pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) despite numerous anti-VEGF injections suggest that the condition may not be typical exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

2. The presence of yellow subretinal deposits, particularly in the right eye, along with hyperreflective foci suggestive of vitelliform material on OCT, points towards a possible vitelliform maculopathy.

3. The history of boat-shaped hyperautofluorescence in the right eye, visible on fundus autofluorescence imaging from 3 years prior, is characteristic of Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) or adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD).

4. The lack of leakage on fluorescein angiography, despite the presence of SRF and PEDs, is atypical for exudative AMD and further supports a different diagnosis.

An electrooculogram can help assess the function of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is particularly useful in diagnosing Best disease, where an abnormally low Arden ratio is typically observed. Molecular genetic testing can identify mutations in the BEST1 gene associated with Best disease or other genes related to adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy.

This approach would help confirm or rule out a hereditary macular dystrophy, which would significantly alter the management strategy. If a vitelliform maculopathy is confirmed, it would explain the poor response to anti-VEGF therapy and guide future treatment decisions, potentially avoiding unnecessary injections and their associated risks in an elderly patient.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

It would be appropriate for acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE), which might present with similar deep, plaquelike lesions; however, APMPPE is a bilateral disease in which ICGA displays uniform early- and late-phase hypofluorescence. Systemic corticosteroids followed by immunosuppression assumes this is serpiginous choroidopathy, which can present in a single eye with expanding peripapillary lesions and similar imaging but usually with less vitreous cell.  Immunosuppression is not preferred owing to the need to consider other diagnoses.Primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL) can present with creamy subretinal infiltrates with vitritis, but the cellular infiltrates are typically thick rather than atrophic. The choroid is not affected in PVRL; therefore, neuroimaging and lumbar puncture are not preferred as initial management. Additional history revealed several trips to Laos with possible exposure to tuberculosis in an endemic region. Referral for treatment of extrapulmonary tuberculosis was based on risk factors, positive interferon gamma release assay, clinical findings, and imaging. Ocular manifestations of tuberculosis serpiginouslike choroiditis (SLC) are well-described.1-3 Tuberculosis SLC is similar to noninfectious serpiginous choroiditis in selectively damaging the inner choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and outer retina. Helicoid or placoid lesions extend from the optic nerve head in both, but multifocal lesions and more vitreous cell are typical of tuberculosis SLC.Choriocapillary closure occurs in both types of serpiginous choroidopathy. Peripapillary-sparing suggests tuberculosis SLC (Figure 2).1,3 Active borders in either type appear hyperautofluorescent with hypoautofluorescence after choriocapillary closure.2 In this patient, mottled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence indicated active or recently active disease, with a densely hypoautofluorescent, older lesion nasal to the optic nerve and newer lesions more distally (Figure 2, inset).Blue autofluorescence image of the left fundus. Yellow borders appear hyperautofluorescent. There is confluent hypoautofluorescence associated with inner choroidal atrophy nasal and superior to the optic nerve. The mottled lesions suggest different stages of disease.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to refer the patient to the health department for 4-drug antituberculous treatment. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Positive interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis: This indicates that the patient has been exposed to TB and has a latent TB infection.

2. Ocular findings: The patient presents with multifocal chorioretinal scars, vitreous haze, and anterior vitreous cell, which are consistent with ocular tuberculosis. The presence of these lesions, especially in the context of a positive IGRA, strongly suggests active ocular TB.

3. Chronic symptoms: The patient has been experiencing worsening blurriness, photopsia, floaters, and intermittent eye redness for the past year, indicating a chronic inflammatory process.

4. Normal chest radiograph: While the chest X-ray is normal, it's important to note that ocular TB can occur in the absence of pulmonary involvement.

Initiating antituberculous treatment is crucial in this case to prevent further ocular damage and potential systemic spread of the infection. The 4-drug regimen typically includes isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, which is the standard treatment for active tuberculosis.

It's important to start treatment promptly rather than observing or initiating steroids alone, as steroids without antimicrobial coverage could potentially worsen the infection. Additionally, while neuroimaging and lumbar puncture might be considered if there were signs of central nervous system involvement, the clinical presentation here is more consistent with isolated ocular TB, making option B less appropriate as the next immediate step.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Autosomal recessive parkinsonism,C,Autosomal recessive parkinsonism,"In patients with relative subacute onset of cognitive decline and movement disorders, treatable causes must be ruled out. In this patient, central nervous system infection was unlikely owing to normal laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing. Paraneoplastic antibody screening was negative, with no malignancies on total-body PET. Newer antibodies against the glycine receptor (GlyR) and immunoglobulinlike cell adhesion molecule 5 (IgLON5) have been discovered that mimic atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Anti-GlyR antibodies are typically associated with stiff-person syndromes or progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Patients with IgLON5 antibodies develop a sleep disorder with parasomnia and/or breathing difficulty with bulbar symptoms, gait abnormalities, oculomotor problems, chorea, and cognitive decline.Although untreatable, the patient’s symptoms, disease course, and abnormal electroencephalogram could indicate Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, but one would expect MRI changes and 14-3-3 protein. Symmetrical parkinsonism, poor levodopa response, early falls, rapid cognitive decline, and brain hypometabolism may raise the suspicion of a tauopathy, eg, progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal degeneration. However, preserved vertical gaze, presence of rapid eye movement–sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and very early onset of symptoms are atypical, and tauopathies were ruled out after brain biopsy. The history of cataracts, hearing loss, osteoarthritis, and hyperlipidemia, made us consider mitochondrial diseases, but screening (eg, mitochondrial DNA testing) was negative.Typical nonmotor features (RBD, restless legs syndrome, visual daytime hallucinations) are a strong indicator for an α-synucleinopathy. This was confirmed by the histopathological finding of Lewy bodies (Figure 2). In patients with early-onset parkinsonism (<50 years), genetic variants should be considered, even with a negative family history. Genetic screening in this patient revealed a novel homozygous variant (c.189dupA [p. Glu64Argfs*5]) within the DJ-1 protein of the PARK7 gene, confirming autosomal-recessive parkinsonism.Immunohistochemistry with silver staining demonstrated scattered globular inclusions and neurites consistent with Lewy bodies and Lewy neuritis (original magnification ×400).PARK7 is one of the rare causative genes for early-onset Parkinson disease (frequency of 1%-2%).1 The DJ-1 protein is expressed in almost all cells (eg, neurons and glial cells) and protects against oxidative stress by various mechanisms.2 In vitro studies have shown that DJ-1 functions as a chaperone protein, modulating α-synuclein oligomerization and cytotoxicity. Absence of DJ-1 in PARK7 gene variants causes a dysregulation in the brain, resulting in misfolding and aggregation.3 The increased prevalence of mitochondrial features in patients with Lewy body pathology highlights the role of PARK7 gene variants in mitochondrial homeostasis.4 Although the exact mechanism is still unclear, in vivo studies have shown that DJ-1 specifically acts on mitochondrial complex I, resulting in oxidative stress resistance.5Typically, patients with PARK7 gene variants have phenotypes similar to idiopathic Parkinson disease, although more complex syndromes with features of anterior horn cell disorders have been described. A recent literature review suggests that a triad of early-onset Parkinson disease, cataracts, and sensorineural hearing loss may be specific for DJ-1/PARK7; however, the phenotypic spectrum is still expanding.6This patient’s motor and cognitive decline have gradually progressed, and he required a wheelchair at age 46 years (<5 years after symptom onset). In this period, he was again given levodopa/benserazide (maximum 200 mg/50 mg given 3 times daily) and a dopamine agonist (rotigotine patch, maximum 6 mg/24 hours); both were not beneficial and were discontinued.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate diagnosis for this case is Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS). This conclusion is based on several key features presented in the clinical case:

1. Age of onset: The patient's symptoms began at a relatively young age (early 40s), which is consistent with mitochondrial disorders.

2. Multisystem involvement: The patient presents with a combination of neurological, sensory, and ophthalmological issues (parkinsonism, hearing loss, early cataracts), which is typical of mitochondrial diseases.

3. Poor response to levodopa: The patient's parkinsonism did not improve with levodopa treatment, which is atypical for idiopathic Parkinson's disease but can occur in mitochondrial disorders.

4. Rapid cognitive decline: This is a feature often seen in MELAS.

5. Neuroimaging findings: The brain FDG-PET/MRI showed asymmetric hypometabolism and crossed cerebellar diaschisis, which are consistent with strokelike episodes seen in MELAS.

6. Additional symptoms: REM sleep behavior disorder, visual hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline are all features that can be associated with mitochondrial disorders.

7. Negative tests for other conditions: The normal CSF findings and negative tests for paraneoplastic antibodies help rule out other potential causes.

While the biopsy showed Lewy bodies, it's important to note that mitochondrial disorders can sometimes present with features that mimic other neurodegenerative diseases. The combination of symptoms, early age of onset, multisystem involvement, and neuroimaging findings strongly suggest MELAS as the most likely diagnosis in this case.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Thus, serum vitamin A levels should be checked (choice B). While vitamin A deficiency is one of the most common causes of malnutrition in low-income countries, it is rarely seen in high-income countries.In 2009, the World Health Organization estimated that 5.2 million preschool-aged children had night blindness and 190 million had low serum retinol concentrations.1 Those with a serum retinol concentration of less than 20.06 μg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.0349) are vitamin A deficient, and severe deficiency is indicated at levels below 10.03 μg/dL.1 Eye findings include hyperemia, conjunctival and corneal keratinization, and Bitot spots. Yellow or white punctate peripheral retinal lesions may be seen, indicating photoreceptor dysfunction. Pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension and nerve atrophy have also been associated with vitamin A deficiency.2,3 Children with ocular signs of vitamin A deficiency have reduced immunity and a higher mortality rate.3,4Children with ASD frequently have nutritional deficits owing to picky eating habits,5 which held true for this patient. His serum vitamin A level was very low at 3.58 μg/dL (normal range, 28.65-94.56 μg/dL ).6The most common ophthalmic symptom of vitamin A deficiency is nyctalopia secondary to rod photoreceptor dysfunction.3 This can be missed in children with ASD, as they may be unable to express difficulty seeing in the dark. Awareness should be raised regarding the possibility of vitamin A deficiency–related corneal ulceration in those with dietary deficiencies.Left untreated, patients with severe disease can go blind within 48 hours.7 The recommended treatment is an immediate oral dose of 200 000 IU vitamin A, followed by the same dose on day 2 and day 14. This is supplemented by 4 to 6 monthly doses of 200 000 IU. Xerophthalmia is reversible within days to weeks of timely supplementation. However, up to 55% of children with ASD and xerophthalmia may have irreversible vision impairment owing to corneal scarring.6Allergy testing and treating with topical steroids (choice A) would be correct for a patient with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). This patient is a young boy with bilateral ulcers and frequently rubs his eyes, which may suggest the diagnosis. However, VKC would not result in a leathery appearance of the conjunctiva and cornea. The conjunctiva would be hyperemic with giant papillae or Horner-Trantas dots. Furthermore, shield ulcers in VKC are typically located on the upper paracentral portion of the cornea rather than the inferior cornea as seen in this case.8Obtaining a herpes simplex virus (HSV) culture would not be the preferred choice (choice C). HSV keratitis typically presents with dendritic corneal lesions and stromal infiltrates, which this patient did not have. Additionally, bilateral HSV keratitis is rare and seen more in patients with atopy or immune dysfunction.9Therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (choice D) is not indicated in this patient who does not have a corneal perforation. However, prompt vitamin A supplementation is needed in such cases to prevent this devastating complication. Keratoplasties performed in children have a poorer prognosis.10 This case highlights the importance of a thorough examination, which may require sedation, to evaluate for signs of underlying nutritional deficiencies causing corneal ulceration in children with ASD.The patient started vitamin A supplementation as per World Health Organization guidelines: 200 000 IU on day 1 and day 2, followed by 200 000 IU on day 14. The corneal infiltrates and epithelial defects improved. Stromal thinning in the right eye remained stable. His conjunctival and corneal keratinization improved dramatically within a few days.

The etiology of dislocation should be considered before surgery is performed (choice A). Connective tissue diseases can be associated with juvenile cataracts and zonular weakness but are associated with extraocular manifestations, making them less likely in this patient.5 Pseudoexfoliation syndrome can be considered given the iris transillumination defects in the fellow eye, but these can also occur following intraocular surgery.The scleral pigmentation and subluxed IOL in the opposing direction make a ciliary body tumor a consideration. Specifically, the focality, elevation, and vascularity of the lesion are concerning. The lesion should be investigated further with imaging before a biopsy is performed (choice D). Optical coherence tomography is useful for conjunctival tumors but is limited in evaluating pathologies posterior to the iris (choice C). However, ultrasound biomicroscopy should provide a high-resolution image of the PCIOL position and evaluate for ciliary body masses, making choice B the correct answer. Indeed, ultrasound biomicroscopy identified a large ciliary mass displacing the PCIOL (Figure 2). B-scan ultrasonography revealed a large ciliochoroidal melanoma measuring 21 mm in largest basal diameter and 16 mm in thickness (Figure 2, inset). Systemic staging imaging did not reveal metastases.Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrating intraocular lens subluxation (pink arrowhead) by a ciliochoroidal melanoma (white arrowhead). Inset, B-scan ultrasound reveals the large intraocular mass.This case highlights that ciliary body masses may not be apparent until quite large. The intraocular melanoma was not seen at the time the subluxed IOL was initially identified. While most uveal melanomas are now treated with radiation therapy, enucleation is indicated for the largest tumors (largest basal diameter >20 mm, thickness >12 mm).6,7 Following primary treatment, patients with uveal melanoma undergo surveillance for both local and distant recurrence. Unfortunately, the risk for distant metastasis approaches 50% and is elevated with ciliary body location.6 There is currently no curative therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma.6,7Given the tumor size, enucleation of the right eye was performed. Pathology confirmed a mixed-type uveal melanoma. Six months after enucleation, liver metastases were identified, presumably related to presence of micrometastases at the time of initial diagnosis and treatment.

[Explanation]
Given the complex clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to order ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). Here's why:

1. Comprehensive imaging: UBM provides high-resolution imaging of the anterior segment, including the cornea, iris, ciliary body, lens, and anterior vitreous. This is crucial in this case, as we need to assess the full extent of the intraocular lens (IOL) subluxation and any associated structural changes.

2. Evaluation of the scleral lesion: The superonasal pigmented scleral lesion is a significant finding. UBM can help evaluate the depth and extent of this lesion, which is essential for determining its nature and potential involvement of deeper structures.

3. Assessment of ciliary body: Given the history of bilateral juvenile cataracts and the current IOL subluxation, there might be underlying ciliary body abnormalities or zonular weakness. UBM is excellent for visualizing these structures.

4. Vitreous involvement: With the noted vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber, UBM can help assess the extent of vitreous involvement and any traction on the retina.

5. Surgical planning: If surgical intervention is needed (such as IOL repositioning or exchange), UBM findings will be invaluable for preoperative planning.

6. Non-invasive: Unlike a biopsy (option C), UBM is non-invasive and carries no risk of spreading a potential malignancy if the scleral lesion is indeed tumorous.

While options A (IOL fixation/exchange) and C (biopsy) might be necessary later, they would be premature without a thorough understanding of the underlying anatomy and pathology. Option D (anterior segment OCT) could be helpful but may not provide as comprehensive information as UBM, especially regarding deeper structures and the scleral lesion.

The presence of left infraduction limitation and corresponding left hypertropia that does not fit the pattern for fourth nerve palsy could be because of partial third cranial nerve palsy. The relevant medical history of hyperprolactinemia makes pituitary apoplexy (ie, sudden hemorrhage within the pituitary gland, often within preexisting pituitary adenoma) and aneurysmal compression of the third nerve the most critical diagnoses to be ruled out. Thus, ordering an urgent computed tomography scan and computed tomography angiography scan of the brain with attention to the sellar region (choice C) would be the most appropriate course of action. Checking thyrotropin and thyroid autoantibody levels and ordering orbital imaging (choice A) would be correct if thyroid eye disease was the suspected culprit. However, sudden onset of headache and nausea is not a typical presentation of thyroid eye disease, making this diagnosis unlikely. While myasthenia gravis can present with vertical binocular diplopia, it would also not explain the sudden onset of headaches and nausea, and other likely signs of myasthenia gravis (eg, orbicularis oculi weakness and variable ptosis fatigable in sustained upgaze) were not present. Thus, ordering acetylcholine receptor antibody level titers (choice B) would not be the most important investigation. Lumbar puncture (choice D) would be the best test to order if subarachnoid hemorrhage were suspected as causing sudden onset of headache and nausea. However, computed tomography scan and computed tomography angiogram imaging are sensitive for identifying aneurysms and detecting blood in the subarachnoid space; thus it should be performed first.The clinical presentation of pituitary apoplexy is highly variable and largely determined by extent of hemorrhage, necrosis, and edema within the pituitary gland. Headache, typically with sudden and severe onset accompanied by nausea and vomiting, is a presenting symptom in more than 70% of patients and likely occurs because of dural traction and/or meningeal irritation secondary to extravasation of blood and necrotic material into subarachnoid space.1,2Vision loss and visual field defects affect 70% of patients with pituitary apoplexy1 due to sudden hemorrhage-related expansion of the pituitary grand and resultant compression of chiasm and prechiasmatic optic nerves. Oculomotor nerve palsies affect half of patients with pituitary apoplexy and occur because of sudden lateral expansion of pituitary tissue into cavernous sinuses, clearly visualized on the computed tomography scan of this patient.3 The third nerve is the most frequently affected.3 Altered consciousness or cerebral ischemia can occur in 15% of cases.4 Frequently, there are no precipitating factors and up to 25% of patients are asymptomatic but hypertension, medications, surgery, coagulopathy, pregnancy and the postpartum period, head injury, radiation, or dynamic testing of the pituitary gland are potential risk factors.5Endocrine dysfunction is an important source of morbidity in patients with pituitary apoplexy and can present before the apoplectic episode, causing menstrual disturbances, fatigue, or galactorrhea, as was the case here. Corticotropic deficiency is the most common3,6 life-threatening hormonal complication, causing hemodynamic instability and hyponatremia and requiring corticosteroid supplementation.4For patients with visual field defects and/or limited ocular motility, transsphenoidal hypophysectomy to decompress the visual pathway is preferred.1 However, if pituitary function remains normal without chiasmal compression or ocular motility, observation can be appropriate.4Computed tomography demonstrated a 1.0 × 1.2-cm high-density pituitary abnormality with evidence of blood within the pituitary gland (Figure), confirming the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary hormone levels were normal, suggesting pituitary apoplexy may have caused infarction of the secretory adenoma, normalizing prolactin level.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to order an urgent computed tomography (CT) scan and CT angiography of the brain.

The patient presents with sudden onset of headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia, which are concerning symptoms that could indicate a serious intracranial pathology. The acute onset and the combination of symptoms raise suspicion for conditions such as:

1. Intracranial mass lesion (e.g., pituitary tumor, given her history of hyperprolactinemia)
2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage
3. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
4. Posterior circulation stroke

The presence of a left hypertropia worse in left gaze and right head tilt suggests involvement of the trochlear nerve (CN IV), which could be due to compression or ischemia.

An urgent CT scan would help rule out acute intracranial hemorrhage or large mass lesions. The CT angiography would provide detailed information about the cerebral vasculature, helping to identify any vascular abnormalities, aneurysms, or areas of ischemia.

While the other options have merit, they are less urgent and do not address the immediate concern of ruling out life-threatening intracranial pathologies:

- Option A (lumbar puncture) could be considered after neuroimaging if subarachnoid hemorrhage is still suspected.
- Option B (thyroid tests and orbital imaging) is more relevant for thyroid eye disease, which is less likely given the acute onset and lack of other thyroid symptoms.
- Option C (acetylcholine receptor antibody titers) would be more appropriate if myasthenia gravis was suspected, but the presentation is not typical for this condition.

Therefore, urgent neuroimaging with CT and CT angiography is the most appropriate next step to evaluate this patient's acute neurological symptoms and guide further management.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

While the most common cause of ptosis in adults is involutional ptosis related to levator dehiscence, other diagnoses should be considered in patients with abnormal clinical findings in addition to ptosis. In such patients, an appropriate workup should be completed prior to surgical repair, making choice A incorrect.Although ptosis that is more notable at night and with fatigue is classically seen with myasthenia gravis, patients with ptosis of other etiologies may report similar symptoms owing to reduced compensatory frontalis action by the end of the day. This patient did not have any neurologic signs or fatiguability on examination, and antiacetylcholine receptor serology findings were negative, making myasthenia gravis less likely and choice B incorrect. Similarly, the patient had normal levator function and extraocular motility, making myogenic ptosis less likely and choice C also incorrect. However, unilateral findings of superior sulcus fullness and increased resistance to retropulsion were concerning for an orbital process, making choice D the most appropriate next step.

Subsequent biopsy and workup demonstrated mantle cell lymphoma without systemic involvement.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with contrast showing a markedly enlarged left lacrimal gland with molding to adjacent ocular structures without bony erosion (main panel, arrowhead). There was also inferior displacement of the left globe with mass effect on the superior rectus-levator complex. A diagnostic biopsy was performed, which revealed mantle cell lymphoma. Three months after the patient completed radiation therapy, repeated MRI showed marked reduction in size of the previously enlarged left lacrimal gland, with near uniform enhancement comparable with that of the right lacrimal gland (left lower insert, arrowhead).Lacrimal gland tumors typically present with progressive proptosis and upper eyelid swelling over the course of 12 months or longer but can present with a shorter duration of symptoms, including ptosis.1-3 On magnetic resonance imaging, lacrimal gland lymphomas classically appear as well-defined masses that conform to the globe and adjacent orbital bones, are mildly hypointense to isointense on T1- and T2-weighted images, and enhance with contrast.3,4 Once a lacrimal gland biopsy confirms the diagnosis, systemic evaluation is performed for staging and treatment planning.4,5Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, representing 2% to 7% of ocular adnexal lymphomas, and is characterized by widespread disease on presentation, an aggressive clinical course, frequent recurrences, and poor survival.6 Current therapeutic options include radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, but systemic therapy may be advantageous even in stage I and II disease because of high risk of relapse.7 Although the prognosis for most ocular adnexal lymphomas is generally good, with a 5-year disease-specific survival of 81%,1,8 5-year disease-specific survival for ocular adnexal mantle cell lymphomas can be as low as 38%.6 Regardless of the initial treatment response, all patients require long-term surveillance for disease recurrence.7This case illustrates how lacrimal gland lymphomas can present as unilateral ptosis and underscores the importance of performing a thorough clinical examination (eg, palpation of periocular soft tissues and resistance to retropulsion) followed by an appropriate workup, which can lead to early detection and treatment of potentially life-threatening conditions.This patient received 24 Gy of radiation to the left lacrimal gland for localized disease.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and examination findings, obtaining orbital imaging with intravenous contrast (option A) is the most appropriate next step. Here's why:

1. Chronic, progressive ptosis: The patient has experienced worsening left-sided ptosis over 9 months, which suggests a slowly growing lesion rather than an acute process.

2. Asymmetry and localized findings: The ptosis is unilateral (left side), and there are additional subtle findings on the left side, including mild fullness in the superior sulcus and increased resistance to retropulsion. These localized changes point towards a space-occupying lesion.

3.

4. No signs of inflammation or infection: The absence of pain, edema, erythema, or tenderness makes inflammatory or infectious causes less probable.

5. Normal ocular examination: The normal visual acuity, extraocular movements, and fundus examination findings suggest that the underlying cause is likely localized to the eyelid or orbit.

Please analyze the following clinical case and the related question:

<clinical_case>
A woman in her 60s with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic migraines presented with 9 months of progressively worsening left-sided ptosis, which was more notable at night and with fatigue. She denied experiencing pain, diplopia, muscle weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, difficulty breathing, or other neurologic deficits.On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally, with normal color vision, visual fields, intraocular pressure, extraocular movements, alignment, and pupils. External examination was notable for left upper eyelid ptosis (Figure 1), with a margin-to-reflex distance 1 of 3.5 mm on the right and 0.5 mm on the left, intact levator function, and no fatiguability on sustained upgaze. There was no evidence of eyelid edema, erythema, or tenderness to palpation. There were no palpable adnexal masses or orbital rim deformities, but there was mild fullness in the left superior sulcus and mildly increased left-sided resistance to retropulsion. However, Hertel exophthalmometry did not reveal any relative proptosis. No lacrimal gland abnormalities or conjunctival masses were seen with upper eyelid eversion. There was no palpable preauricular or cervical lymphadenopathy. Slitlamp and fundus examination findings were normal. Serological testing results for antiacetylcholine receptor antibody were negative.Clinical photograph of both eyes showing left upper eyelid ptosis. Margin-to-reflex distance 1 was 3.5 mm on the right and 0.5 mm on the left.

In this patient, disproportional choroidal exudation in the context of a solid lesion unresponsive to steroid therapy was strongly suggestive of malignancy.The yellow discoloration noted in only 1 eye was unusual and likely reflected a subacute process related to long-standing choroidal fluid buildup.4 Unlike the scleral impregnation with bilateral involvement classically seen in jaundice,5 the ocular coloration changes developed in this patient indicated a local mechanism, mediated by fluid extravasation from the choroidal compartment to the subconjunctival space.4 Therefore, screening for causes of bilirubin elevation, such as liver dysfunction and biliary tract obstruction (choice A), would not be the first step taken.Given the presence of an intraocular mass, primary and secondary neoplasms should be foremost investigated before any treatment consideration. Surgical drainage of the hemorrhagic content (choice B) and management with plaque brachytherapy (choice C) would not be advisable until a final diagnosis was reached because of risks of incomplete disease control and tumor seeding. Based on the characteristics of the lesion on imaging, notably heterogeneous reflectivity, irregular surface, and infiltrative pattern, which typically signal uveal metastasis as opposed to primary melanoma,6 screening for an occult systemic primary cancer should be the first course of action (choice D).Accordingly, the patient underwent full-body imaging studies with computed tomography of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. She was identified with a 6 × 9-cm silent mass at the upper left pulmonary lobe with associated mediastinal adenopathy (Figure 2). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the lung tumor revealed primary adenocarcinoma. Other metastatic lesions were also identified on the thoracic spine.Computed tomography scan reveals a lobular lung tumor (arrowhead).Metastasis is the most common ocular malignancy in the adult population, affecting the choroid in 85% of patients by hematogenous dissemination.6,7 Metastatic implants are visible on fundoscopy as single or multiple light-yellow solid lesions of variable shape usually with associated subretinal fluid.6 Primary sites have been localized, in order of frequency, to breast, lung, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and cutaneous melanoma.7 In a large series, uveal metastasis from lung cancer was more prevalent in men (55%) and mainly unifocal (77%) and unilateral (82%).8 Approximately 40% of individuals had the original tumor discovered only after detecting uveal lesions8 similar to what we observed in this patient. Although choroidal effusion may be a nonspecific finding attributable to metastatic systemic neoplasms,3,6 a threshold of suspicion for underlying malignancy is advisable in the face of any intraocular solid growth.The patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy (entrectinib) and external beam radiotherapy to the mediastinum and orbits (20 Gy, 5 fractions).

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to investigate liver dysfunction and biliary tract obstruction (Option B).

The key features that support this decision are:

1. Subconjunctival yellow discoloration: This is a significant finding that suggests hyperbilirubinemia, which is often associated with liver dysfunction or biliary tract obstruction.

2. Diffuse conjunctival chemosis of yellow hue: This further reinforces the possibility of hyperbilirubinemia.

3. Choroidal effusion and hemorrhage: While these can occur due to various causes, they can also be associated with liver disease, particularly in cases of severe coagulopathy.

4. Absence of systemic symptoms: The patient's review of systems was negative for jaundice, which makes the ocular findings even more important as they may be the first sign of an underlying liver or biliary issue.

While the initial concern was for choroidal melanoma, the yellow discoloration and effusion suggest a systemic cause rather than a primary ocular malignancy. Investigating liver function and the biliary system is crucial because:

1. It can reveal the underlying cause of the ocular symptoms.
2. If liver dysfunction is confirmed, it may explain the choroidal hemorrhage due to potential coagulation abnormalities.
3. Treating the underlying liver or biliary issue may lead to resolution of the ocular symptoms.

The other options are less appropriate at this stage:
A. Ruling out an occult systemic neoplasm is premature without first investigating the more obvious signs of liver dysfunction.
C. Plaque brachytherapy would be inappropriate before confirming the diagnosis, especially given the signs pointing away from melanoma.
D. Draining the hemorrhage is invasive and should not be done before understanding the underlying cause, which could be systemic.

Therefore, investigating liver dysfunction and biliary tract obstruction is the most logical next step in this patient's management.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

The ice test is a quick and effective examination that has been shown to be highly specific and sensitive in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.1-3 Although testing for antibodies (choice A) against the acetylcholine receptor or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase can help confirm a diagnosis of ocular myasthenia gravis, other etiologies must be ruled out, including orbital masses, cavernous sinus syndrome, and isolated oculomotor nerve palsy, some of which may be vision or life threatening.4,5Improvement of the ptotic eyelid is considered the hallmark of a positive ice test result, and initial studies evaluating the ice test revealed that patients with myasthenic ptosis typically demonstrate an improvement of 2 mm or greater in the MRD1.1,2 In contrast, patients with nonmyasthenic causes of ptosis, such as oculomotor nerve palsy and senile levator dehiscence, showed changes in the MRD1 (≤1 mm) that did not meet the threshold for a positive test result.1,2 Although an increase of 1.5 mm in the MRD1 as observed in this patient does not meet the criteria for a positive test result, it was greater than the typical changes observed in previously reported negative test results. Rare cases of false-positive test results have been observed in patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia or cavernous sinus syndrome and after botulinum toxin injection.3,6 Although equivocal findings may lead to an eventual diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, other masquerading diagnoses should be considered prior to intervention (choice D) or repair (choice C).This patient presented with limitation in supraduction consistent with a superior divisional oculomotor palsy. To rule out etiologies with higher morbidity, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits was performed in addition to concomitant antibody testing. The magnetic resonance image revealed a 1.9-cm aneurysm in the right cavernous sinus leading to compression of the right internal carotid artery and oculomotor nerve, as well as a 5-mm aneurysm arising from the internal carotid artery in the left cavernous sinus (Figure 2). Compressive aneurysms along the cavernous, hypophyseal, and ophthalmic segments of the internal carotid artery are a well-described cause of oculomotor nerve palsy that may require neurosurgical or endovascular intervention. Variable diplopia due to aneurysmal causes has rarely been reported and is hypothesized to be due to intermittent hyperfunction of extraocular muscles innervated by the third cranial nerve.7 While rare, superior divisional palsies have been reported in cavernous carotid aneurysms, due to the bifurcation of the nerve at the anterior cavernous sinus into the superior and inferior division.8,9Axial T1-weighted magnetic resonance image of brain and orbits revealed a 1.9-cm aneurysm in the cavernous sinus (arrowhead), causing compression and medial deviation of the right internal carotid artery and subsequent compression of the oculomotor nerve.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step is to begin symptomatic management with a cholinesterase inhibitor. This decision is supported by several key factors in the case:

1. Fluctuating diplopia and worsening ptosis: These symptoms are characteristic of myasthenia gravis (MG), a neuromuscular junction disorder.

2. Positive ice pack test: The 1.5-mm improvement in ptosis after applying an ice pack for 2 minutes is a positive result, strongly suggestive of MG. The ice pack test is a simple, non-invasive diagnostic tool for MG with high specificity.

3. No improvement after previous ptosis repair: This indicates that the ptosis is likely not due to a structural problem, but rather a neuromuscular issue.

4. Absence of other neurological symptoms: The patient doesn't report headache, weakness, or difficulty swallowing, which makes other neurological conditions less likely.

5. Age and medical history: MG can occur at any age, but late-onset MG (after 50 years) is not uncommon.

Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, are the first-line symptomatic treatment for MG. They improve neuromuscular transmission by increasing the availability of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. This treatment can provide rapid symptomatic relief and serve as a diagnostic test - significant improvement with cholinesterase inhibitors further supports the diagnosis of MG.

While serum testing for autoantibodies (option D) would be valuable for confirming the diagnosis, starting symptomatic treatment is more urgent given the patient's symptoms. MRI (option C) and revision ptosis repair (option B) are less appropriate at this stage, as the clinical presentation strongly suggests a neuromuscular rather than structural issue.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

The patient presented 9 months after the last cyclophotocoagulation procedure.At presentation, she was taking dorzolamide-timolol, brimonidine, netarsudil, and latanoprost for her left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 11 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. Examination of the left eye revealed a large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass inferotemporally near the Ahmed valve (Figure 1). There was a left hypertropia of more than 45° by Hirschberg test. The anterior chamber was deep with fine silicone oil bubbles superiorly. The aphakic left eye revealed a well-positioned tube. Cup-disc ratios were 0.7 OD and 0.8 OS. The retina was centrally attached under silicone oil with a stable peripheral tractional retinal detachment.Preoperative appearance of a subconjunctival mass of the left eye after inferior temporal Ahmed valve surgery.Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve What Would You Do Next?",Bleb revision with excision of the mass,Fine-needle aspiration of the mass,Silicone oil removal from the vitreous cavity,Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve,Subconjunctival silicone oil granuloma,D,Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve,"Although neoplasia is in the differential diagnosis of a slow-growing subconjunctival mass (choice B), it is less likely in this case because of the atypical appearance (Figure 1), as well as the temporal relationship of the appearance of the mass after tube-shunt surgery. Silicone oil removal (choice C) was not performed owing to the risk of retinal redetachment. Therefore, choice D was the best option for maximizing both cosmesis and comfort measures because mass excision alone (choice A) would not have minimized further egress of the intraocular emulsified oil through the tube and into the growing subconjunctival mass. Plus, concomitant supplemental diode laser would best preempt future pain owing to uncontrolled high IOPs (choice D).To our knowledge, this is one of the largest subconjunctival silicone oil granulomas described in the literature, and it is a reminder to surgeons that silicone oil can migrate with scleral melt, with globe rupture, through both sutured and unsutured sclerostomies, and with or without a glaucoma implant.1-9 Silicone oil migration is more likely when there is no lens, can occur even with inferiorly placed glaucoma implants, and has been reported for both valved and nonvalved implants.2-5 Silicone oil migration can present as chemosis, eyelid swelling, an eyelid mass, ptosis, an orbital mass, a nasopharyngeal silicone oil polyp, and/or, as in this case, a subconjunctival mass and strabismus.1-9 Silicone oil can also migrate intracranially, with or without an optic nerve pit.8 Silicone oil granuloma formation after retina surgery, with or without a history of tube-shunt surgery, should be considered among postoperative complications. In this case, risk factors for oil migration were being aphakic and having a tube. Also, the oil had been in the eye for more than 2 years, and over time, silicone oil tends to emulsify, which facilitates its ability to migrate.Intraoperatively, the subconjunctival mass appeared to be an encapsulated area of scar tissue encased around silicone oil bubbles. The resected episclera and capsule was a 2.5 × 2.1 × 0.5-cm aggregate of multiple fragments of tan-pink soft tissue with histopathologic findings (Figure 2A) showing an exuberant giant cell reaction to nonpolarizable foreign material and round empty vacuoles of varying sizes, similar to other reports.2,3,6-9 Postoperatively, silicone oil remained in the posterior segment with an approximate 30% fill.A, Histopathologic findings of the surgical specimen of a subconjunctival silicone oil granuloma of the left eye (hematoxylin-eosin, magnification ×100). There are pseudocystic spaces and empty vacuoles of varying sizes with surrounding giant cell reaction, which is consistent with a silicone oil granuloma and past silicone oil tractional retinal detachment repair. B, Postoperative appearance at 1 month after silicone oil granuloma excision, Ahmed valve removal, and diode cyclophotocoagulation of the left eye.Photographs taken 1 month after surgery (Figure 2B) showed resolving eyelid edema and a well-healing inferior temporal conjunctival peritomy with a desirable cosmetic outcome. The large subconjunctival mass of the left eye is noticeably absent. At the last follow-up 2 months after surgery, the patient’s visual acuity was hand motion OS with an IOP of 15 mm Hg while receiving the same preoperative glaucoma medications.In this case, the potential risks to minimize granuloma formation (eg, earlier oil removal, earlier tube removal, longer tube length) would have not justified the small benefit of preventing a rare event, with only more than a dozen similar cases reported in the literature.",Ophthalmology,2022-02-01,2022,2,"A 20-year-old woman presented with complaints of blurred vision in her left eye over several weeks and a growing, bulging left-eye mass.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this complex case is option C: Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve.

This decision is based on several factors:

1. Intractable glaucoma: The patient has a history of difficult-to-control glaucoma in the left eye, requiring multiple interventions including trabeculectomy, Ahmed tube implant, and multiple diode cyclophotocoagulation treatments. Despite these interventions and current use of multiple glaucoma medications, the intraocular pressure (IOP) remains elevated at 20 mm Hg.

2. Presence of a subconjunctival mass: The large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass near the Ahmed valve is concerning. Given its location and the patient's history, it's likely related to the Ahmed valve implant, possibly representing a complication such as encapsulation or foreign body reaction.

3. Limited visual potential: The patient's left eye has light perception vision only, with a history of multiple complications including retinal detachment, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and advanced glaucomatous damage (cup-disc ratio 0.8).

4. Risks of other options: 
   - Silicone oil removal (option A) could lead to retinal redetachment.
   - Fine-needle aspiration (option B) would not address the underlying glaucoma or potential valve-related issues.
   - Bleb revision with excision of the mass (option D) may not be sufficient given the complex history and ongoing glaucoma.

Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation can help lower IOP by reducing aqueous production. Removing the mass and Ahmed valve will address the subconjunctival mass and any potential valve-related complications. This combined approach targets both the glaucoma and the mass, providing a more comprehensive solution for this complex case while avoiding the risks associated with intraocular surgery in an eye with multiple prior interventions and retained silicone oil.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

OM was first described in 1903.1 It can occur at any age and more commonly affects women.2 It commonly presents as painful diplopia or orbital inflammation with chemosis, proptosis, or conjunctival hyperemia. The horizontal recti muscles are most frequently affected, although the superior or inferior recti can also be involved.3 The inflammatory process (Figure 2) appears to be mediated by helper T-cell type 1, with significant elevations in interleukin 12, tumor necrosis factor α, and interferon γ.4 Diagnosis of OM is based on physical examination and radiologic features excluding other etiologies and may require tissue biopsy when features are atypical or response to corticosteroids is inadequate.Left lateral rectus muscle biopsy results show prominent chronic inflammatory infiltrates composed of a mixture of epithelioid histiocytes and small-sized lymphocytes, associated with markedly atrophic residual skeletal muscle fibers (yellow arrowheads) and scattered eosinophils (blue arrowheads) (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×200).Acute idiopathic OM is the most common form of OM and typically affects a single muscle and is corticosteroid responsive. Recurrent OM occurs in 15% of patients and is more common in men. OM is more likely to be recurrent if multiple extraocular muscles are involved on presentation or if there is a lack of response to initial corticosteroid treatment.2,5 In such cases, adverse effects from long-term corticosteroids often necessitate the use of alternative maintenance therapy, such as infliximab, rather than continuing corticosteroids indefinitely (option A).6Autoimmune and infectious causes of OM should be considered in atypical cases and include IgG4-related disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthropathies, vasculitis, Lyme disease, herpes zoster, and cysticercosis. Ocular manifestations occur in 3% of patients with IBD,7 although IBD-associated OM is a rare extraintestinal manifestation, which is more commonly bilateral and recurrent.8Medication-induced OM has been reported, particularly with bisphosphonates and monoclonal antibody therapies, and usually occurs early after commencing treatment. Medication-induced OM improves rapidly with removal of the causative agent9; it usually involves more than 1 extraocular muscle and may have atypical features. Although IBD-associated OM was a possible cause of this patient’s symptoms, the early symptom onset after commencing ustekinumab raised the possibility of medication-induced OM, in which case stopping the potential causative agent is required (option B). To our knowledge, there have been 2 previous cases of OM related to ustekinumab that have been reported on the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System, including in 1 patient with Crohn disease.10Rarely, OM can be a paraneoplastic phenomenon. In this setting, OM is usually bilateral and affects most or all the extraocular muscles; therefore, paraneoplastic disease would be considered less likely in the presented scenario (option C).8 Treatment of the primary lesion typically leads to resolution.OM can be difficult to distinguish from Grave ophthalmopathy; however, the lack of upper eyelid retraction and normal thyroid antibodies would favor OM in this case (option D). Early treatment of OM may prevent extraocular muscle fibrosis and strabismus; therefore, it is important to reach a diagnosis, start corticosteroid treatment, and identify and treat any underlying cause.The patient’s treatment was changed from ustekinumab to vedolizumab for treatment of Crohn disease.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case would be to change therapies for Crohn disease. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical case:

1. Temporal relationship: The patient's symptoms began shortly after changing his Crohn's disease medication from infliximab to ustekinumab (6 weeks prior to presentation).

2. Exclusion of other causes: The case describes normal laboratory findings for several potential causes of orbital inflammation, including thyroid disease, IgG4-related disease, sarcoidosis, and autoimmune conditions.

3. Biopsy results: The orbital biopsy showed chronic inflammation without evidence of malignancy or specific pathology.

4. Response to steroids: The patient's symptoms resolved with prednisone but recurred upon tapering, suggesting an ongoing inflammatory process.

5. Known association: Inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's can have extraintestinal manifestations, including orbital inflammation.

Changing the Crohn's disease therapy addresses the likely root cause of the orbital inflammation. The recent switch to ustekinumab may have triggered this extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease. Reverting to the previous medication (infliximab) or trying a different biologic agent might help control both the intestinal and orbital inflammation.

Options A and B (further thyroid tests and imaging for malignancy) are less appropriate because thyroid function tests were already normal, and the biopsy did not suggest malignancy. Option C (long-term prednisone) would only treat the symptoms without addressing the underlying cause and could have significant side effects if used long-term.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

A patient with a history of drug use and many sexual partners further supports ruling out an infection, particularly syphilis and HIV. Idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis is a common cause of optic nerve edema with abnormal visual function in patients younger than 50 years, although it typically does not present with panuveitis.1 Therefore, beginning methylprednisolone would not be appropriate without proper systemic workup (choice B). Cytomegalovirus optic neuritis should be on the differential diagnosis for any patient with substantial risk factors for HIV/AIDS, although there were no signs suggestive of cytomegalovirus retinitis on examination and therefore treatment with foscarnet is not appropriate (choice C). Intracranial imaging may be warranted in the evaluation of papilledema, but magnetic resonance imaging of the brain would be more appropriate than computed tomography of the head, as it better detects optic neuritis and cerebrospinal fluid outflow obstructions (choice D).1 Additionally, his subsequent blood pressure measurements lowered and his initial reading was felt to be transient in the setting of an emergency visit, and thus, hypertension was not felt to be the causative etiology.Syphilis, tuberculosis, HIV, Lyme disease, and Bartonella are common culprits of infectious optic neuropathies, so a detailed history on sexual practices, drug use, travel history, and exposure to cats should be taken.1 Primary syphilis includes a painless chancre; secondary syphilis includes a macular papular rash involving the palms and soles, condylomata lata, and lymphadenopathy; and tertiary syphilis includes gummas, aortitis, and tabes dorsalis. Ocular syphilis can occur at any stage of the syphilitic infection, and its varying, wide range of clinical presentations makes it known as the “great masquerader.”2,3 Since Treponema pallidum cannot be cultured in vitro, the diagnosis of syphilis relies on treponemal and nontreponemal serologic testing. Nontreponemal testing is generally used as an initial screening test, monitoring therapeutic response to treatment, and includes the rapid plasma reagin and Veneral Disease Research Laboratory (VRDL) tests.4 However, they may be associated with false-positive results in patients with autoimmune diseases, tuberculosis, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, pregnancy, rickettsia infections, and other spirochetal infections.2 Treponemal testing consists of the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption and Treponema microhemagglutin assay; since they are highly sensitive and specific for syphilis, they are traditionally used as confirmatory tests after nontreponemal testing, although they cannot be used to assess treatment response.5,6 Alternatively, the reverse syphilis testing algorithm begins with a treponemal test followed by a confirmatory nontreponemal test. This algorithm has a higher sensitivity in diagnosing primary and secondary syphilis at 98.3% compared with 72.9% via the traditional pathway.7,8HIV testing should be pursued in cases of suspected syphilis because of the high incidence of coinfection (20%-70%).6 Syphilis and HIV are mandatory reportable diseases in all 50 states. On positive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test results and signs of ocular syphilis (especially with retinal or optic nerve involvement), an infectious disease specialist should be consulted and lumbar puncture should be performed with cerebral spinal fluid VRDL testing with repeated lumbar puncture to monitor for successful treatment.5,9,10 The treatment of neurosyphilis is with intravenous aqueous penicillin G for 10 to 14 days; in the case of a penicillin allergy, desensitization (recommended), ceftriaxone, doxycycline, or tetracycline are alternatives.3,4 The visual outcome after treatment is variable, with syphilis uveitis having the most improvement and optic neuritis having poor visual prognosis.3,5,9Fundus autofluorescence did not reveal a classic placoid lesion, but his rapid plasma reagin test and syphilis antibody test results were both positive.

[Explanation]
Given the patient's clinical presentation and medical history, obtaining HIV and syphilis serology results (Option D) is the most appropriate next step. Here's why:

1. Risk factors: The patient has a history of intravenous drug abuse and multiple sexual partners, which are significant risk factors for both HIV and syphilis.

2. Ocular symptoms: The patient presents with bilateral painless vision loss, photophobia, and funduscopic findings (disc edema, flame hemorrhages) that are consistent with ocular manifestations of both HIV-related opportunistic infections and neurosyphilis.

3. Systemic involvement: The patient's hypertension (173/137 mm Hg) could be related to underlying systemic disease, which further supports the need for comprehensive serological testing.

4. Differential diagnosis: While the presentation could be consistent with other conditions like cytomegalovirus retinitis or optic neuritis, ruling out HIV and syphilis is crucial due to their prevalence in high-risk populations and their potential for causing similar ocular manifestations.

5. Treatment implications: Confirming or ruling out HIV and syphilis is essential before initiating any specific treatment, as the management would differ significantly based on these results.

6. Non-invasive and informative: Serological testing is a non-invasive procedure that can provide critical information to guide further management.

Neuroschistosomiasis,B,Neuroschistosomiasis,"Although listeriosis is a major cause of rhombencephalitis, the CSF typically does not show eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, and the patient’s blood and CSF cultures were sterile. Beyond listeriosis, other infections (herpesvirus infections and tuberculosis) and autoimmune diseases (Behçet disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, demyelinating diseases, and paraneoplastic syndromes) may cause rhombencephalitis.1 The patient presented with a nodular lesion with an heterogenous, multinodular, contrast-enhancing pattern consistent with a granulomatous disease (eg, infection by mycobacteria, fungi, parasite, or even sarcoidosis).2,3The differential diagnosis is narrowed largely by the CSF characteristics. Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis is defined as the presence of more than 10 eosinophils/mm3 in CSF and/or eosinophils accounting for more than 10% of cerebrospinal leukocytes.4 The most common cause of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis is invasion of the central nervous system by helminthic parasites, such as Angiostrongylus cantonensis, Gnathostoma species, Schistosoma mansoni, and Taenia solium.5 Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis may present eosinophilia and neuromyelitis-optica spectrum disorders may present some eosinophils in the CSF, but we would not expect sufficient eosinophils to fulfill the definition of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in these diseases.With the history of recent travel to northeastern Brazil, an endemic region for S mansoni, we ordered immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibody tests for this parasite in the patient’s CSF, of which results were positive. We also tested for antibodies in the blood using the enzyme-linked immunoassay  method, of which results were undetermined. Different from antibodies in the CSF, antibody detection in blood samples cannot distinguish between prior and active infection and have limited specificity for the diagnosis of neuroschistomiasis in endemic areas.6Results for Kato-Katz testing for S mansoni eggs were negative. However, this test has low sensitivity, especially when a single sample is used because egg burden in feces may be uneven and may lack sensitivity in the acute phase of infection because it may take up to 2 months for the adult worms to deposit the eggs in the bowel wall.7We believe the present patient fulfills the diagnosis of neuroschistosomiasis according to criteria proposed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention8: (1) typical syndrome as eosinophilic meningoencephalitis is suggestive of an infection caused by helminths, including schistosomiasis, (2) evidence of schistosomiasis demonstrated by the presence of positive immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G  antibodies for S mansoni in the CSF, and (3) a reasonable exclusion of the differential diagnosis.Neuroschistosomiasis can develop during any stage of the infection by S mansoni. However, an intense granulomatous response with clinically significant eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, eosinophilia, patchy pulmonary infiltrates, the presence of immunoglobulin M antibodies in the CSF, the absence of eggs in the Kato-Katz testing, and the presumed exposure are all suggestive of the acute phase of the infection that usually occurs 28 to 90 days after the infection and precedes oviposition.6In Brazil, the most common presentation of neuroschistosomiasis is myeloradiculopathy owing to the parasite migration via the Batson venous plexus. However, case reports and a systematic review of 33 cases published from 1989 to 2019 of cerebral infection with S mansoni showed that brainstem lesions can also occur.9There is a concern for initial worsening of neurologic symptoms with administration of anthelmintic therapy with praziquantel because the egg destruction may lead to further central nervous system inflammation. Although there is a lack of consensus on the optimal treatment of neuroschistosomiasis, many authors believe this complication can be prevented by corticosteroids, usually prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/d, started a few days before the initiation of praziquantel and continued for at least 2 months.10Even with adequate therapy for neuroschistosomiasis, this patient presented with severe dysphagia and was submitted to orotracheal intubation.

[Explanation]
The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Neuroschistosomiasis (Option D). This conclusion is based on several key factors from the clinical case:

1. Travel history: The patient had traveled to northeastern Brazil 2 months before symptom onset. Brazil is an endemic area for schistosomiasis.

2. Neurological symptoms: The patient presented with headache, dysarthria, double vision, dizziness, and mild right-side hemiparesis with hyperreflexia and hemiataxia. These symptoms are consistent with central nervous system involvement, particularly in the brainstem region.

3. MRI findings: The MRI showed a T2-weighted FLAIR hyperintense lesion with heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement in the pons, which is consistent with neuroschistosomiasis.

4. Eosinophilia: The patient's blood test showed an elevated eosinophil count (1703/uL, 16.4% of total leukocytes), which is a characteristic finding in schistosomiasis.

5. CSF analysis: The cerebrospinal fluid showed pleocytosis with a significant proportion of eosinophils (26%), which is highly suggestive of parasitic infection, particularly neuroschistosomiasis.

6. Pulmonary involvement: The CT scan revealed bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates, which can occur in schistosomiasis due to larval migration.

The combination of neurological symptoms, eosinophilia, CSF eosinophilia, travel history to an endemic area, and characteristic MRI findings strongly support the diagnosis of neuroschistosomiasis. This condition occurs when Schistosoma parasites invade the central nervous system, causing focal neurological deficits and inflammatory responses.

A. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder typically affects the optic nerves and spinal cord, not the brainstem.

Differential diagnoses include neuroblastoma, hematoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, hemangioma, cyst, or bleeding diathesis. While bleeding diathesis could cause ecchymosis and subconjunctival hemorrhage (D), the temporal mass indicates that the hemorrhages may represent a more ominous finding. Reassurance (B) or contacting Child Protective Services (C) is inappropriate before further workup. Findings that should prompt Child Protective Services referral include multilayer retinal hemorrhages.Neuroblastoma, a malignancy of neural crest origin, is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. The incidence is 1 per 10 000 live births in the US.1 It commonly occurs in the adrenal medulla. Patients are usually asymptomatic, but may have generalized symptoms or anemia from spontaneous tumor hemorrhage. Symptoms generally occur due to tumor growth or metastases. Sites of metastasis include bone, bone marrow, liver, orbit and spinal cord, which cause bone pain, periorbital ecchymosis and proptosis, and progressive paraplegia.1,2Only 8% of neuroblastoma cases present with orbital signs. In the largest review of cases with orbital involvement, there were 10 patients and periorbital ecchymosis (racoon eyes) was the most common finding, followed by proptosis.3 Other findings included periorbital edema, subconjunctival hemorrhage, vision loss, and decreased ocular motility.3 Neuroblastoma can also cause a paraneoplastic syndrome leading to cerebellar dysfunction and opsomyoclonus.1Diagnostic workup includes computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging, urine homovanillic and vanillylmandelic acid tests, iodine-131-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (I-MIBG) scan for bone involvement, and bone marrow or primary tissue biopsy. Tissue is analyzed for cytogenetic aberrations or molecular markers.1 Loss of 1p, 3p, and 11q, unbalanced gain of 17q, or amplification of MYCN protooncogene indicate poor prognosis.4 Treatment is based on age and extent of spread; this includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.1Prognosis depends on age, stage, and risk stratification; stratification is complex and based on chromosomal aberrations, histopathology, and extent of spread (complete risk stratification is available in the cited reference).5 Neuroblastoma accounts for 15% of cancer-associated deaths in children, and patients older than 2 years have a worse prognosis. High-risk neuroblastoma is relegated to a 30% to 40% survival.2,5 Orbital metastasis are associated with poor prognosis and can be misdiagnosed as orbital fractures, child abuse, benign hemorrhages, or other tumors.3 Ophthalmologists can play a role in diagnosing neuroblastoma and should promptly refer to a pediatrician or oncologist when neuroblastoma is suspected.CT head and orbits showed multiple osseous lesions with intracranial and intraorbital extension (Figure 2).

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation of this 13-month-old boy, the most appropriate next step would be to perform brain and orbital imaging (Option A). This decision is based on several key factors from the case:

1. Persistent symptoms: The bilateral eyelid ecchymosis and edema have been present for 1 month, and the right temporal mass has persisted for 1.5 months. This duration suggests a potentially serious underlying condition rather than a simple trauma-related issue.

2. Presence of a mass: The right temporal mass, which has not changed in size, is a concerning finding that requires further investigation. It could indicate a variety of conditions, including neoplasms or vascular malformations.

Please analyze the following clinical case and the related question:

<clinical_case>
A 13-month-old boy with an unremarkable medical history and no ocular history was brought to the emergency department by his parents for bilateral eyelid ecchymosis and edema for 1 month, as well as a mass on the right temporal area that was persistent for the past month and a half. He had hit the right side of his head on a table 1 month before symptoms developed, but had no other recent trauma. The mass had not changed in size, was not tender, and had no other associated symptoms. His parents had not noticed any change in vision. At bedside, the patient was playful and in no acute distress. On examination, he fixed and followed in each eye. His pupils were equal and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. Both eyes were soft to palpation and his extraocular movements were full. Externally, his examination was notable for bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema, as well as a soft, well-circumscribed mass on the right temporal region (Figure 1). There was no obvious proptosis. He was also noted to have subconjunctival hemorrhage temporally on the right eye. Otherwise, findings of his anterior examination and dilated fundoscopic examination were normal.External photographs show bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema, temporal subconjunctival hemorrhage of the right eye, and a right temple mass (asterisk).Reassurance and treatment with cool compresses and artificial tears

Given the rate of aggressive progression and risk of vision loss to the left eye, the best decision is to proceed with biopsy of the right optic nerve. Complete surgical excision was not possible because of the involvement of the tumor at the chiasm; the biopsy was to evaluate the grade and immunohistochemistry of the tumor prior to starting radiation. Performing the biopsy via a transorbital (choice A) rather than transcranial route would allow radiation to start more expeditiously. Transcranial biopsy (choice B) is not preferred because of longer recovery and potential delay of radiotherapy. Chemotherapy and/or radiation prior to knowing the grade of the tumor (choice C) would not be preferred. Observation of a tumor with chiasmal involvement places the patient at significant risk for visual loss on the left side (choice D). Tumor at the chiasm, described as “masslike expansion,” would potentially threaten the entering fibers from the left optic nerve.A biopsy was performed of the right optic nerve for immunohistochemical analysis and to assess if biologic therapies could be offered. The patient was evaluated with Genetics and Oncology; no additional personal features or family history of neurofibromatosis, type 1, were observed. The pathology revealed tumor cells with round to ovoid nuclei and a K967 proliferation of 20% to 30%, consistent with pilocytic astrocytoma with anaplastic transformation.Pilocytic astrocytomas affect approximately 4.8 persons per 1 million in adults and account for approximately 3% to 5% of all childhood central nervous system tumors; approximately 2% of pilocytic astrocytomas have anaplastic features.1-3 Anaplastic features are diagnosed primarily with morphological appearance, including multiple mitoses in a single high-powered field, vascular endothelial proliferation, high Ki67 proliferation index (up to 35% in some tumors), and palisading necrosis.1,4While pilocytic astrocytoma carries a World Health Organization (WHO) grade I diagnosis, anaplastic pilocytic astrocytoma is WHO grade III.5 WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytomas are slow growing, well circumscribed without invasion to surrounding tissue, and rarely require surgical intervention; in contrast, WHO grade IV pilocytic astrocytomas have more aggressive features with poorer outcomes.1,5 Previous tumor sequencing of anaplastic pilocytic astrocytomas has shown associations with BRAF mutation, p16 loss, and absence of p53 mutation.6,7 Radiotherapy is an option in this older patient; in children, adverse effects to the central nervous system may be prohibitive.7Tissue obtained during biopsy was used for a tumor DNA/RNA panel, which revealed high tumor mutation burden with multiple variants in cancer genes including NF1, NOTCH1, and P53, confirming the anaplastic nature of the tumor. The patient underwent focal radiation therapy. Repeated MRI 3 months later showed interval decrease in the cisternal portion of the tumor and the right side of the optic chiasm.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to perform a transorbital biopsy of the right optic nerve for grading and immunohistochemistry. This decision is based on several key factors:

1. Diagnostic uncertainty: Despite initial treatment for presumptive optic neuritis, the patient's condition did not improve. The second MRI revealed findings suggestive of an optic nerve glioma, which is a different diagnosis requiring a different treatment approach.

2. Need for definitive diagnosis: A biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of optic nerve glioma and to determine its grade and molecular characteristics. This information is crucial for planning appropriate treatment.

3. Treatment planning: The results of the biopsy, including grading and immunohistochemistry, will guide the selection of the most effective treatment strategy. Different grades of gliomas may require different approaches, such as surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.

4. Avoiding unnecessary aggressive treatment: Without a definitive diagnosis, more aggressive treatments like transcranial resection (option A) or immediate chemotherapy/radiation (option C) could be premature and potentially harmful.

5. Progression of symptoms: The patient's vision has deteriorated to no light perception in the right eye. While this is concerning, it does not preclude the need for a biopsy to guide further management and protect the left eye.

6. Preservation of options: A biopsy is the least invasive option that provides crucial information. It allows for more informed decision-making regarding subsequent treatments, whether they be surgical, medical, or observational.

By choosing a transorbital biopsy, we can obtain the necessary diagnostic information to guide appropriate treatment while minimizing risks associated with more aggressive interventions at this stage.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

A persistently growing unilateral subcutaneous periorbital lesion in an adult should raise concern for neoplasm and be promptly biopsied for histopathologic evaluation (choice B). Conservative management with warm compresses and eyelid massage (choice A) is appropriate for benign lesions arising from clogged meibomian or sebaceous glands, such as a chalazion or hordeolum, which typically present along the eyelid margins. Incision and drainage (choice C) is appropriate for an abscess, which often presents with fluctuance, local erythema, and systemic signs. Observation is only appropriate for benign conditions (choice D), which cannot be definitively diagnosed from physical examination alone.In this patient, histopathology showed a large, well-circumscribed focus of polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (Figure 2) staining positive for S100, CD68, and Sox10. These findings were consistent with a granular cell tumor (GCT), a rare, often benign, tumor of Schwann cell origin occurring mainly in the head and neck, with orbital or periorbital involvement in approximately 3% of cases.1 Tumors develop during the fourth and sixth decades of life, with female predilection.2Photomicrograph (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×40) of granular cell tumor wherein the lesion is composed of bland polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (arrowhead). These cells stained positively with S100 and CD68, while the nuclei stained positively with Sox10.Histologically, GCTs are composed of nests of polygonal cells with small, round nuclei and abundant cytoplasm.3 Cytoplasms contain eosinophilic granules that are periodic acid–Schiff positive.4 The vast majority of GCT lesions stain positive for S100, neuron‐specific enolase, Sox10, and CD68, but negative for epithelial, muscle, and melanin markers.2 Approximately 1% to 3% of all GCTs are malignant, characterized by rapid growth and high rates of recurrence or morbidities.2 Differentiation between malignant and benign GCTs is made by the presence of mitotic activity, necrosis, increase in nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, vesicular nuclei, spindling of cells, and pleomorphism,5 none of which were present in the histopathology from this patient.Clinically, GCTs present as a slow-growing, well-demarcated, unilateral lesion.6 Common manifestations include pain surrounding the lesion as seen in this patient, diplopia from extraocular motility restriction, and proptosis for deeper lesions.2 Lesions with intraorbital location or extension should be assessed with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to aid in diagnosis and surgical planning.7The treatment for GCT is complete surgical excision, irrespective of whether the lesion is benign or malignant.6 If malignant, tumors can metastasize or become locally destructive; adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy are used, although their roles are unclear at this time.8 The local recurrence rate of GCT after complete excision is less than 7%.2,9As a general principle, a progressively enlarging subcutaneous periorbital mass in an adult is typically caused by infection, inflammation, or a neoplasm.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be a trial of conservative management with warm compresses and eyelid massage (Option D).

The patient presents with a small (3-mm), subcutaneous, firm, mobile, and noncompressible lesion near the lateral canthus of the right eye. The lesion has grown gradually over 2 months and is tender to palpation. There are no signs of infection (no redness, warmth, or discharge), no vision changes, and no history of trauma. The rest of the ocular examination is normal.

Given these characteristics, the lesion is most likely consistent with a chalazion, which is a benign, localized inflammation of the meibomian gland. Chalazia often respond well to conservative management, which includes warm compresses and gentle massage of the eyelid. This approach helps to soften the blocked gland contents and promote drainage.

Conservative management is the first-line treatment for suspected chalazia and should be attempted before considering more invasive procedures. It is non-invasive, carries no risks, and can often resolve the issue without the need for surgical intervention.

Observation (Option A) alone is not appropriate as the lesion is symptomatic (tender) and has been growing.

An excisional biopsy (Option B) would be premature at this stage, given the benign appearance of the lesion and the absence of suspicious features for malignancy (such as ulceration, telangiectasia, or rapid growth).

Incision and drainage (Option C) would also be too aggressive as an initial approach, especially without first attempting conservative management.

Therefore, a trial of conservative management with warm compresses and eyelid massage is the most appropriate next step in this case.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Neuroimaging is indicated to identify a potential culprit lesion of which the etiology is broad and includes neoplastic, vascular, trauma, and postsurgical causes.1 It is a diagnostic dilemma when a patient presents with a homonymous visual field defect without an obvious abnormality on neuroimaging. In this case, measuring blood glucose levels to investigate hyperglycemia would be the next best step considering the patient’s reported lethargy and polydipsia (choice B). Measure C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (choice A) would not be the preferred option since a vasculitis and secondary infarct was not supported by the history or neuroimaging findings.2 A lumbar puncture (choice C) was not recommended as the next step since the presentation was not consistent with a meningeal process based on the history, examination, and MRI findings. Given his CT and MRI already ruled out vascular and neoplastic causes, magnetic resonance angiography (choice D) was unlikely to add any additional information and would not be the next recommended step.Nonketotic hyperglycemia (NKH) is characterized by severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolality, and intracellular dehydration with little or no ketoacidosis. Patients with NKH may have neurologic manifestations depending on the location of brain involvement and include seizure, homonymous hemianopia, and hyperkinetic movement disorders.3 Various positive visual phenomena including colored objects, photopsias, and complex visual hallucinations have been reported as part of homonymous visual field defects associated with hyperglycemia.1,3-6 While patients with a known history of type 2 diabetes may have homonymous hemianopia as a sign of NKH indicating poor glycemic control, it is much less common for an isolated homonymous hemianopia to be the presenting sign of type 2 diabetes like in this case.1,3,4,6-8 The pathophysiology of cerebral injury from hyperglycemia is unclear; proposed mechanisms include an increase in reactive oxygen species, altered neurotransmitter function, and intracellular dehydration.9Neuroimaging usually reveals cortical hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences and subcortical T2 hypointensity.10 In contrast, CT scans are usually unremarkable in neurological complications of NKH.5 The reversibility of MRI changes and lack of significant restricted diffusion (excluding an ischemic etiology) suggests an epileptic etiology for the hemianopic visual field defect.3,5,6 Seizures are common in patients with NKH, the majority of which are partial motor seizures. However, occipital lobe seizures have also been demonstrated on electroencephalogram (EEG), MRI, and visual evoked potentials.3-5 Stayman et al6 reported 3 patients with hyperglycemia with recurrent ictal discharges originating from the contralateral posterior quadrant on video EEG and occipital lobe hypermetabolism on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.Recognition of hyperglycemia as the underlying metabolic disorder causing the homonymous hemianopia is crucial for initiation of appropriate management with insulin therapy and adequate hydration. As this is a provoked seizure, maintenance antiepileptic therapy is not necessary since management primarily depends on correction of the hyperglycemia. This case highlights a rare cause of homonymous visual field defects. Consideration of an ictal etiology in the patient with hyperglycemia presenting with intermittent homonymous visual field defects is important for prompt initiation of treatment and to avoid unnecessary investigations.The patient’s bloodwork results revealed a random glucose level of 473.87 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555) and a hemoglobin A1c level of 11.8% (normal <6%; to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01). His homonymous hemianopia was thought to reflect seizure activity in the context of hyperglycemia. He was admitted to the hospital for optimization of his blood glucose levels and a routine EEG was obtained and was normal, although a clinical event was not captured during the recording. However, he noticed immediate cessation of colored images around the visual field defect on receiving intravenous lorazepam. His blood glucose levels normalized with subcutaneous insulin, metformin, and gliclazide and his visual field defect resolved after 4 days.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and findings, measuring blood glucose levels (option A) is the most appropriate next step. Here's why:

1. Symptoms suggestive of hyperglycemia: The patient reports feeling lethargic and experiencing polydipsia (excessive thirst), which are classic symptoms of hyperglycemia.

2. Visual disturbances: The patient's primary complaint is visual field defects. While these could be due to various causes, hyperglycemia can lead to neurological symptoms, including visual disturbances. In particular, the description of colors surrounding the dark area could be consistent with migraine-like phenomena, which can occur in the setting of metabolic disturbances such as hyperglycemia.

3. Normal initial imaging: The CT scan was normal, and the MRI showed only subtle abnormalities. This makes vascular causes (which would be investigated by MRA) less likely as the primary issue.

4. Risk factors: The patient has a history of dyslipidemia, which is often associated with metabolic syndrome and diabetes.

5. Potential for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state: The combination of visual disturbances, lethargy, and polydipsia raises concern for a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, which can present with neurological symptoms and requires urgent diagnosis and treatment.

6. Non-invasive and quick: Measuring blood glucose is a simple, non-invasive test that can quickly provide crucial information to guide further management.

While the other options (MRA, lumbar puncture, and inflammatory markers) might be considered later in the diagnostic process, checking blood glucose is the most urgent and potentially revealing next step given the clinical picture. If hyperglycemia is confirmed, it would explain many of the patient's symptoms and guide immediate treatment, potentially reversing the visual symptoms and preventing further complications.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is glaucoma tube surgery (Option A). This decision is based on several critical factors in the clinical presentation:

1. Acute vision loss: The patient has experienced a sudden drop in visual acuity in the left eye to light perception only, indicating a severe and urgent condition.

2. Extremely elevated intraocular pressure (IOP): The left eye has an IOP of 54 mm Hg, which is dangerously high and requires immediate intervention to prevent further optic nerve damage.

3. Large cystic iris stromal lesion: The lesion has significantly enlarged, causing iris-cornea touch and shallow anterior chamber, which are contributing to the elevated IOP and compromising the eye's anatomy.

4. History of primary open-angle glaucoma: The patient already has a history of glaucoma, making her optic nerve more susceptible to damage from elevated IOP.

5. Failure of current glaucoma medications: The patient's current glaucoma medications (dorzolamide and brimonidine) are clearly insufficient to control the IOP in this acute situation.

Glaucoma tube surgery would provide a reliable and long-term solution for IOP control in this complex case. It would create an alternative pathway for aqueous humor drainage, bypassing the compromised anterior chamber angle. This approach would address both the immediate threat to vision from the extremely high IOP and provide ongoing management for her pre-existing glaucoma.

The other options are less suitable:
- YAG laser (B) might provide temporary relief but doesn't address the underlying anatomical issues and could potentially cause further complications.
- Biopsy (C) is not urgent given the previous negative fine-needle aspiration and would not address the immediate threat to vision from high IOP.
- Observation (D) is inappropriate given the acute vision loss and dangerously high IOP, which require immediate intervention.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

It has been shown to have a dose-associated toxicity including polyarthralgia/arthritis, aphthous stomatitis, skin pigmentation, and uveitis.2 Signs and symptoms of anterior uveitis with or without hypopyon, intermediate uveitis, and posterior uveitis or panuveitis may occur between 2 weeks and 7 months following the start of therapy. Symptoms can present with dosage as low as 300 mg/d.3,4 Symptoms have been shown to worsen with increasing dose. Most cases resolve within 1 to 2 months of discontinuation of rifabutin and administration of topical corticosteroids. Published reports of rifabutin-associated uveitis have all been associated with concurrent medications like clarithromycin and fluconazole. These medications elevate serum rifabutin levels by inhibition of the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 system that metabolizes rifabutin. This patient was taking concurrent clarithromycin as part of her MAC infection treatment.5,6 Patients with rifabutin-associated uveitis have excellent visual prognosis, and most return to 20/30 visual acuity 3 weeks after initiating topical corticosteroid treatment, in some cases without requiring medication cessation.7The initial clinical presentation of this patient was complicated by the recent history of trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. The constellation of conjunctival hyperemia, anterior chamber cellular reaction, hypopyon, and poor view of fundus in the context of trabeculectomy was highly suspicious for bleb-related infectious endophthalmitis. On clinical examination, the patient did not have a bleb leak or obvious blebitis. However, diagnosis of bleb-related endophthalmitis could not be excluded based on our clinical findings. Studies have shown that blebitis without bleb leak and blebitis with bleb leak present at a similar incidence (0.10% vs 0.11%).8 Bleb-related endophthalmitis is one of the most serious sight-threatening late sequelae of trabeculectomy surgery for glaucoma. Treatment is extremely time sensitive. Therefore, in this clinical scenario, it was important for the patient to undergo immediate aqueous sampling to rule out infectious etiology and receive immediate hyperemia of intravitreal antibiotics.The patient was referred back to her infectious disease specialist for discontinuation of rifabutin and consideration for alternative treatment of her MAC infection.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to review and adjust systemic medications and treat with topical corticosteroids. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical case:

1. Recurrence pattern: The patient experienced a similar acute vision loss in the left eye two months after the initial episode in the right eye. This suggests a systemic cause rather than a localized infection.

2. Medical history: The patient has a history of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection and is on multiple systemic medications (clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifabutin). These medications, particularly rifabutin, are known to cause uveitis as a side effect.

3. Previous treatment outcome: The initial episode in the right eye was treated as endophthalmitis with vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotics. However, the culture results were inconclusive (very light growth of S. aureus, suspicious for contaminant), suggesting that the initial diagnosis of infectious endophthalmitis might have been incorrect.

4. Current presentation: The left eye shows signs of inflammation (conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon) without a clear infectious source.

Given these factors, it's more likely that the patient is experiencing drug-induced uveitis rather than infectious endophthalmitis. Rifabutin, in particular, is known to cause bilateral uveitis with hypopyon. 

By reviewing and adjusting the systemic medications (potentially reducing or discontinuing rifabutin if possible), we can address the root cause of the inflammation. Topical corticosteroids will help manage the acute inflammatory symptoms in the eye.

This approach is less invasive than a vitrectomy and avoids unnecessary antibiotic use, which is important given the patient's complex medical history and previous antibiotic exposure.

Please analyze the following clinical case and the related question:

<clinical_case>
A 72-year-old woman presented with new-onset decreased vision in the right eye. Her ocular history included pseudoexfoliation syndrome and glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the right eye. Past ocular surgery included uncomplicated trabeculectomy in the right eye treated with mitomycin C (3 months prior) and no ocular surgery history in the left eye. Her medical history included pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia. Computed tomography scan 2 months prior exhibited reactivation and she started treatment with clarithromycin (1000 mg/d), ethambutol (15 mg/kg/d), and rifabutin (300 mg/d).Best-corrected visual acuity was hand motions OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressures were 4 mm Hg ODand 13 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye showed substantial conjunctival hyperemia and substantial cellular response in the anterior chamber (2 to 3+) along with a 1-mm hypopyon. There was no leak at the trabeculectomy bleb (negative Seidel test). B-scan ultrasonography showed no retinal detachment or mass. Presumed diagnosis of bleb-related infectious endophthalmitis was made and she was referred for treatment. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed, including vitreous sampling, and showed very light growth of Staphylococcus aureus in 1 colony on 1 plate, which was highly suspicious for contaminant. Intravitreal amikacin and vancomycin were administered after vitreous sampling was performed. Postoperatively, the patient initiated treatment with topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. Her visual acuity returned to 20/30.Two months later, she presented again with a similar acute vision loss in the left eye (counting fingers). Anterior segment examination showed conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon (Figure).Slitlamp photograph showing conjunctival hyperemia and hypopyon (arrowhead) of the left eye.Pars plana vitrectomy with hyperemia of intravitreal antibioticsReview and adjust systemic medications and treat with topical corticosteroids

</options>",6.262796878814697,"content=""A\n\n[Explanation]\nThe most appropriate next step in this case is to review and adjust systemic medications and treat with topical corticosteroids. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical case:\n\n1. Recurrence pattern: The patient experienced a similar acute vision loss in the left eye two months after the initial episode in the right eye. This suggests a systemic cause rather than a localized infection.\n\n2. Medical history: The patient has a history of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection and is on multiple systemic medications (clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifabutin). These medications, particularly rifabutin, are known to cause uveitis as a side effect.\n\n3. Previous treatment outcome: The initial episode in the right eye was treated as endophthalmitis with vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotics. However, the culture results were inconclusive (very light growth of S. aureus, suspicious for contaminant), suggesting that the initial diagnosis of infectious endophthalmitis might have been incorrect.\n\n4. Current presentation: The left eye shows signs of inflammation (conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon) without a clear infectious source.\n\nGiven these factors, it's more likely that the patient is experiencing drug-induced uveitis rather than infectious endophthalmitis. Rifabutin, in particular, is known to cause bilateral uveitis with hypopyon. \n\nBy reviewing and adjusting the systemic medications (potentially reducing or discontinuing rifabutin if possible), we can address the root cause of the inflammation. Topical corticosteroids will help manage the acute inflammatory symptoms in the eye.\n\nThis approach is less invasive than a vitrectomy and avoids unnecessary antibiotic use, which is important given the patient's complex medical history and previous antibiotic exposure.

His presentation was concerning for leukemic optic nerve infiltration. Also considered were hypertensive papillopathy, an intracranial mass with intracranial hypertension, an intracranial hemorrhage with Terson syndrome, and inflammatory or infectious sources of bilateral atypical optic neuritis. Urgent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits was ordered (choice C), and high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was started. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage without optic nerve enlargement or enhancement, findings that did not suggest leukemic optic nerve infiltration.1 A lumbar puncture demonstrated red blood cells, a mildly elevated opening pressure of 31 cm H2O, and cytology findings of malignant cells consistent with CML with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Given the intracranial hemorrhage with both intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages, a diagnosis of Terson syndrome was made.Terson syndrome occurs when intraocular hemorrhage presents in patients with intracranial hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury. The intraocular hemorrhage can occur in the vitreous, subhyaloid, intraretinal, or subretinal spaces.2 Rupture of small retinal venules secondary to increased intracranial pressure is the leading proposed mechanism. The source of increased venous pressure is debated and thought to be attributable to either direct compression of the central retinal vein from optic nerve–sheath hemorrhage or increased orbital venous pressure from increased intracranial pressure.2,3Although there was no leukemic optic nerve infiltration, an appropriate workup revealed previously unsuspected subclinical CNS involvement of CML. Extramedullary CNS involvement of CML is rare but can occur because of poor blood-brain barrier penetration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.3 Leukemic optic nerve infiltration is uncommon in CML but should be ruled out when any suspicion occurs, since it warrants emergency treatment. This often includes radiotherapy, since the optic nerves are considered pharmacologic sanctuaries from chemotherapy.4,5Contacting radiation oncology (choice B) without first initiating a workup to confirm suspected leukemic infiltration is inappropriate. After ruling out leukemic infiltration, methylprednisolone was discontinued and intrathecal chemotherapy was started. The patient was observed and reassured that his visual acuity could improve when the hemorrhages resolved, since most patients with Terson syndrome achieve 20/30 visual acuity or better.6 Reassurance prior to confirming the diagnosis (choice D) is inappropriate. Pars plana vitrectomy may be performed in cases of nonresolving hemorrhage.7 Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (choice A) is not indicated in Terson syndrome.Intracranial hemorrhage is the second most common complication, after infection, among adults with hematologic malignant conditions, and it is often the presenting sign of CNS involvement.8 Terson syndrome has been described in the context of systemic CML but not with concurrent CNS involvement.9 This case represents the rare occurrence of Terson syndrome leading to the diagnosis of extramedullary CML in the CNS.This patient underwent intrathecal chemotherapy with a subsequent bone marrow transplant.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and the patient's medical history, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits.

The patient presents with bilateral blurry vision, floaters, and peripapillary hemorrhages in both eyes. These symptoms, combined with his history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) refractory to multiple treatments, raise suspicion for central nervous system (CNS) involvement of his leukemia.

An MRI of the brain and orbits would be crucial for several reasons:

1. Rule out CNS leukemia: CML can occasionally involve the CNS, including the optic nerves. An MRI can detect leukemic infiltration of the optic nerves or other CNS structures.

2. Evaluate for other causes: The MRI can help identify other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as intracranial hemorrhage or space-occupying lesions, which could be complications of his underlying disease or treatment.

3. Guide further management: The results of the MRI will inform the next steps in the patient's care, potentially influencing the planned bone marrow transplant or necessitating additional interventions.

4. Assess optic nerve involvement: The MRI can provide detailed images of the optic nerves, helping to determine if there is direct involvement or compression causing the observed retinal changes.

While the other options might be considered later, they are not the most appropriate next step without first obtaining more diagnostic information through imaging. Observation (B) would be inappropriate given the severity of symptoms and underlying disease. Intravitreal injections (A) or radiation therapy (D) would be premature without first understanding the full extent of the problem through imaging.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Episcleritis causes congestion of superficial episcleral vessels, which constrict when exposed to phenylephrine, whereas scleritis causes congestion of deeper vessels, which are not significantly affected by phenylephrine.1Scleritis is often associated with a systemic disease, so further investigation is recommended prior to starting treatment (choice C).2 Differential diagnosis includes autoimmune causes (rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatous polyangiitis, relapsing polychondritis, etc) and infections (syphilis, herpes viruses, etc).1,2 Work-up should be tailored to clinical presentation and review of systems and includes serum autoantibody testing (rheumatoid factor, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, etc), sarcoidosis screening, syphilis testing, urinalysis, and others.1-3 Nodular and diffuse anterior scleritis often respond to oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (choice A).2 Corticosteroids (choice B) and systemic immunosuppression are recommended for patients who do not respond or necrotizing scleritis.1,3 Topical corticosteroids (choice D) can reduce inflammation, but systemic treatment is often required.1Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum and has 4 stages.4 The primary stage presents with a nontender chancre at the site of inoculation.1 Secondary syphilis is characterized by a skin rash that resolves with or without treatment.1 Untreated patients develop latent syphilis and 30% of these patients progress to tertiary syphilis, characterized by gumma, cardiovascular involvement, and neurosyphilis.5 All cases of syphilis must be reported to the public health department for contact tracing.6Ocular involvement occurs in 10% of patients with secondary or tertiary syphilis, and uveitis is the most common finding.5 Scleritis is usually seen in tertiary syphilis.7 Other manifestations of ocular syphilis include interstitial keratitis, chorioretinitis, papillitis, and Argyll Robertson pupil (light-near dissociation).1 Patients with HIV infection are at an increased risk of neurosyphilis and bilateral ocular involvement.8Serologic testing for syphilis includes nontreponemal tests (ie, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] and rapid plasma reagin) and treponemal tests (ie, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed and T pallidum particle agglutination).1 In the US, patients are usually tested using a nontreponemal screening test followed by a treponemal test to confirm positive results.9 However, some researchers advocate for initial screening with a treponemal test owing to the reduced sensitivity of nontreponemal tests during late stages of the disease.10 Because ocular syphilis often occurs in the tertiary phase, all patients with ocular involvement should undergo lumbar puncture with VDRL testing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to evaluate for neurosyphilis. This test lacks sensitivity and, therefore, a reactive CSF-VDRL result confirms the diagnosis but a negative test result does not exclude it.7Patients with tertiary syphilis are treated with 10 to 14 days of intravenous penicillin. Systemic corticosteroids may be added to prevent a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (a febrile reaction occurring in response to the release of endotoxins after initiation of treatment).7All laboratory test results (including antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and urinalysis) were negative except for syphilis IgG and rapid plasma reagin. Lumbar puncture showed a positive CSF-VDRL. The patient received a 14-day course of intravenous penicillin, which resulted in resolution of eye pain and redness within a few days (Figure 2).Slitlamp examination of the right and left eyes 1 week after finishing a 14-day course of intravenous penicillin shows resolution of redness in both eyes.",Ophthalmology,2021-10-01,2021,10,"A 68-year-old man presented to the clinic with bilateral eye redness and pain for the past 6 months.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and patient history, the most appropriate next step would be to conduct a laboratory work-up for infectious and autoimmune diseases (Option C).

The patient presents with bilateral eye redness and pain lasting for 6 months, which is suggestive of scleritis. The lack of blanching with phenylephrine confirms that the redness is due to deep scleral inflammation rather than superficial conjunctival injection. The chronicity of symptoms, bilateral involvement, and tenderness to touch further support this diagnosis.

Several factors in this case warrant a thorough laboratory investigation:

1. HIV status: Although the patient's HIV is well-controlled, HIV-positive individuals are at increased risk for various infectious and autoimmune conditions that can cause scleritis.

2. Sexual history: The patient's history of unprotected sexual contact with multiple partners increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections that can cause ocular inflammation, such as syphilis.

3. Systemic associations: Scleritis can be associated with various systemic autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis) or infections (e.g., tuberculosis, syphilis).

4. Chronicity and severity: The long-standing nature of the symptoms and their bilateral presentation suggest a potentially serious underlying condition that requires identification before treatment.

A laboratory work-up would help identify any underlying systemic conditions and guide appropriate treatment. This may include tests for syphilis (RPR, VDRL), tuberculosis (QuantiFERON-TB Gold), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and others as clinically indicated.

Starting treatment with NSAIDs, topical corticosteroids, or oral corticosteroids (Options A, B, and D) without identifying the underlying cause could potentially mask symptoms of a serious infection or systemic disease, delaying proper diagnosis and treatment.

This process localizes to the left cavernous sinus where the sixth nerve, trigeminal nerve, and sympathetic fibers travel in proximity: third-order sympathetic fibers from the hypothalamus exit the internal carotid artery adventitia and pass alongside the sixth nerve as it courses through the cavernous sinus. The trigeminal ganglion is located in the Meckel cave, a dura-lined cavity lateral to the cavernous sinus, where the peripheral trigeminal divisions originate. Divisions V1 and V2 are pure sensory nerves, whereas V3 also carries motor nerves involved in mastication, explaining impaired chewing and drooling in this patient. All 3 divisions enter the cavernous sinus after exiting the Meckel cave. While brainstem lesions can cause multiple cranial neuropathies, slow progression of symptoms without accompanying neurological deficits make this unlikely in this case.In this patient, high-resolution neuroimaging is the next best step (option C). CT angiography (option A) can reveal vascular abnormalities of the cavernous sinus but will not identify subtle nonvascular lesions. Here, long-standing trigeminal numbness suggests a compressive etiology best visualized on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lumbar puncture (option B) can rule out infectious, neoplastic, or inflammatory processes but would not localize the pathology. Elevated inflammatory markers (option D) may suggest giant cell arteritis, which can rarely present with sixth nerve palsy. However, slow-evolving symptomatology in this patient and trigeminal nerve involvement essentially rule out this diagnosis.Brain MRI demonstrated an expansile lesion at the left cavernous sinus and the Meckel cave with extension into the pterygopalatine fossa and foramen ovale (Figure 2). Radiographic characteristics were consistent with trigeminal ganglion schwannoma with compression of adjacent structures. Subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed normal composition and cytology.Gadolinium-enhanced T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrates signal hyperintensity in the left cavernous sinus and left Meckel cave with no abnormal signal seen on T1 imaging. The optic nerves and orbits are intact bilaterally.Intracranial schwannomas are the most common benign intracranial tumor in adults following meningiomas and pituitary tumors.1 Occurrence may be sporadic or in association with neurofibromatosis type 2, and malignant transformation is very rare.2,3 Treatment entails surgical resection4,5 or, increasingly, stereotactic radiosurgery.6 Despite radiosurgery, approximately one-third of cases may progress and symptomatic improvement is seen in fewer than 50% owing to the challenging tumor location.7 As in the present case, trigeminal schwannomas are often misdiagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia is a distinct syndrome characterized by short, recurrent episodes of sharp pain. Atypical cases may feature prolonged facial pain.8 In contrast, trigeminal schwannomas frequently present with chronic facial parasthesias.9 Diplopia is also common due to cavernous sinus involvement.5,9 To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of trigeminal schwannoma presenting with abducens palsy and Horner syndrome.Ophthalmologists must assess for Horner syndrome in patients with new abducens nerve palsy, as this suggests cavernous sinus pathology and necessitates urgent contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain. Recognizing atypical headache syndromes can help ophthalmologists identify cases requiring further investigation.The patient underwent radiotherapy in an attempt to reduce tumor burden.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Acute onset of neurological symptoms: The patient presents with sudden-onset bilateral horizontal diplopia and left-sided upper eyelid ptosis, suggesting an acute neurological event.

2. Multiple cranial nerve involvement: The clinical findings indicate involvement of multiple cranial nerves:
   - CN III (oculomotor): Left upper eyelid ptosis and limited eye movement
   - CN VI (abducens): No abduction of the left eye
   - CN V (trigeminal): Reduced sensation in left V1-V3 distribution and decreased corneal sensation
   - CN VII (facial): Mild flattening of the nasolabial fold

3. Horner's syndrome: The smaller left pupil, especially in the dark, suggests Horner's syndrome, which can be caused by lesions affecting the sympathetic pathway.

4. History of trigeminal neuralgia: The patient's history of left-sided facial pain, previously diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia, may be related to the current presentation.

5. Normal recent CT: While a recent CT was reported as normal, MRI with contrast is more sensitive for detecting soft tissue abnormalities, especially in the brainstem and skull base.

Given these findings, an MRI with contrast would be the most informative next step. It can help identify potential causes such as:
- Brainstem infarction or hemorrhage
- Cavernous sinus thrombosis or inflammation
- Skull base tumors or metastases
- Demyelinating diseases

MRI is superior to CT for visualizing the brainstem, cranial nerves, and surrounding structures, making it the optimal choice for further investigation in this complex neurological presentation. The contrast enhancement will help in detecting any inflammatory or neoplastic processes that might be causing the patient's symptoms.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Indeed in this case, urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin (β2M) testing (choice B) revealed normoglycemic glycosuria and increased β2M levels (6.6 mg/24 h; reference range, 0.02-0.37), suggestive of tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome (TINU).1 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits (choice C) was not indicated as urgent investigation, because the observed optic disc edema was most likely secondary to the intraocular inflammation rather than a central nervous system dysfunction. However, MRI of the brain and orbits was performed electively and did not show any abnormalities. Finally, observation (choice D) in symptomatic and active uveitis is not recommended.TINU is a rare cause of uveitis accounting for less than 2% of cases of uveitis and mostly affecting young patients with a median age at onset of 15 years.2,3 Prevalence of TINU may be underestimated because of lack of recognition mainly in patients without evidence of kidney dysfunction or when proper laboratory testing is not performed at the first presentation.4 Diagnosis requires both tubulointerstitial nephritis, suggested by kidney dysfunction and urinalysis, and uveitis. Notably, both kidney and eye disease can be asymptomatic and have independent progression.2 Kidney dysfunction, whose clinical presentation is usually nonspecific (rash, arthralgia, and fever), is the result of an acute kidney injury that can eventually lead to chronic kidney disease.2,5 Urinalysis may be positive for proteinuria, glycosuria, and cells, while urinary β2M is increased in the vast majority of cases.4 Kidney biopsy is the definitive diagnostic procedure to confirm tubulointerstitial nephritis. Hettinga et al,1 though, have shown that increased urinary β2M, combined with increased serum creatinine levels, is a reliable marker with high positive and negative predictive values for the diagnosis and monitoring of TINU. Other causes of uveitis with possible kidney involvement, such as sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, should always be excluded.1,2,6Uveitis onset is variable but usually occurs 3 months after the onset of nephritis, and younger patients are more likely to develop a chronic course of uveitis (more than 3 months), despite proper treatment.2,7 Although second-eye involvement can occur after presentation, uveitis is most commonly bilateral anterior.3 Posterior ocular involvement or panuveitis are less common, although the optic disc may be involved in almost half of the patients at presentation.3-5,7,8 Photophobia, loss of vision, and painful and red eye are the main presenting symptoms.The mainstay of treatment of TINU is topical and systemic corticosteroid therapy, which provides overall favorable outcomes. A close ophthalmic follow-up is recommended over the first year after the diagnosis, since recurrences are common and the use of immunomodulatory therapy is often needed.2,4This patient presented with unilateral anterior uveitis and bilateral posterior ocular involvement, indicating that TINU may have a broad clinical presentation. Therefore TINU should be always considered as a possible cause of uveitis in pediatric population.A kidney biopsy to confirm the diagnosis was deemed unnecessary because of the morbidity of the procedure. The patient was given a tapering course of oral steroid and topical treatment of anterior uveitis. Both the uveitis and the kidney function dramatically improved after treatment. Optic disc edema improved 1 week after the start of oral steroid treatment and the patient was later switched to mycophenolate mofetil as a steroid-sparing agent.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and findings, ordering a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is the most appropriate next step for this patient. Here's why:

1. Bilateral optic disc swelling: The patient presents with swelling of the optic discs in both eyes, which is more pronounced in the right eye. This bilateral involvement suggests a potentially serious underlying condition that requires further investigation.

2. Anterior uveitis: The patient has signs of anterior uveitis in the right eye (conjunctival hyperemia, ciliary congestion, anterior chamber flare, and keratic precipitates), which could be associated with various systemic conditions.

3. Elevated serum creatinine: The patient's serum creatinine level is significantly elevated (1.57 mg/dL), indicating potential kidney dysfunction. This, combined with the ocular findings, raises suspicion for a systemic condition affecting both the eyes and kidneys.

4. Age and atypical presentation: At 14 years old, this presentation is unusual and warrants thorough investigation to rule out serious underlying conditions such as intracranial masses, demyelinating diseases, or systemic inflammatory disorders.

5. Incomplete diagnosis: While the ocular findings are well-documented, the underlying cause remains unclear. An MRI can help identify or rule out conditions such as optic neuritis, intracranial hypertension, demyelinating diseases, or space-occupying lesions that could explain the bilateral optic disc swelling and associated symptoms.

6. Guide further management: The results of the MRI will be crucial in determining the appropriate treatment plan and whether additional systemic workup is necessary.

Starting treatment without further investigation (option B) could potentially mask an underlying serious condition. Observation alone (option A) is not appropriate given the concerning findings. While a urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin test (option D) might be helpful given the elevated creatinine, it should not be prioritized over neuroimaging in this case.

Medical history was positive for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with cochlear origin as determined by an otolaryngologist and headache since age 35 years. She had no history of longer-term use of medications. There was no family history of hearing and vision loss in all immediate family members. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/63 OS. Her pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment was unremarkable.

Fundus autofluorescence revealed a fairly symmetric loss of autofluorescence in the macula and in the regions surrounding the optic disc (Figure). In proximity of these areas of reduced autofluorescence, a speckled fundus autofluorescence pattern of alternating spots of increased and decreased autofluorescence was also noted.

While age-related macular degeneration is the most common disorder associated with macular atrophy, macular atrophy may be also the result of medications-associated retinal toxicity, ocular inflammation, and genetically determined retinal dystrophies. A detailed collection of medical and family history is mandatory as initial workup in cases of macular atrophy.Mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes syndrome (MELAS) represents a clinical entity associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.1,2 As with  other mitochondrial disorders, MELAS is maternally inherited and is characterized by incomplete penetrance.1-3 MELAS is due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. Specifically, the MT-TL1 mitochondrial gene (OMIM 590050) is the most frequently mutated and, in particular, the most frequent is the point mutation m.3243A>G/MT-TL1.4,5 Besides the full-blown MELAS,1,2 this disorder may have variable clinical expressivity with a broad spectrum of manifestations.4,5 This variability is partially related to the phenomenon of heteroplasmy, defined as the coexistence of wild-type and mutated mtDNA copies in the same cell. As distinct cells and tissues may have different heteroplasmy percentages, the phenotypic expression may vary among patients.6-10The retinopathy associated with MELAS has heterogeneous presentations, and De Laat et al10 differentiated the MELAS-associated retinopathy in 4 stages, as follows: (1) presence of fine pigment changes, (2) evidence of yellowish or mildly pigmented deposits, (3) outer retina and RPE atrophy outside the fovea; and (4) atrophy involving the fovea.For these reasons, when a middle-aged patient presents with a macular atrophy associated with neurologic manifestations, the suspect of a mitochondrial disease (MELAS or maternally inherited diabetes and deafness) is mandatory. First, a detailed family history should be collected. However, family history may be unrevealing because mitochondrial disorders may have incomplete penetrance, and de novo mutations, although uncommon, may also occur. Second, blood tests for lactic acidosis and genetic testing should be performed. Nonetheless, the diagnosis can be complicated as heteroplasmy may be a cause of false-negative blood genetic testing to identify mtDNA mutations in leukocytes. Therefore, genetic testing should be replicated on other epithelial or postmitotic tissues (eg, urinary epithelial cells, buccal mucosa, or skeletal muscle) in cases of high suspicion and negative results on blood cells. In this patient, blood test results were negative for both lactic acidosis and presence of mitochondrial gene mutations. However, the subsequent genetic testing on urinary epithelial cells was positive for m.3243A>G mutation (52% of heteroplasmic load) and a diagnosis of MELAS-related syndrome was made.Prescribing laboratory testing to investigate causes of intraocular inflammation (choice A) would not be the preferred answer because a bilateral macular atrophy is an uncommon presentation for uveitis, especially in a patient without other ocular signs of inflammation. A genetic testing for pattern dystrophy (choice B) was not recommended as the next step as this disease is not usually associated with neurologic disorders (ie, headache and hearing loss). A genetic testing for Stargardt disease (choice D) would not be the next recommended step because of the presence of atrophy around the optic disc, which is unusual in Stargardt disease.The patient was extensively informed about her condition and the prognosis.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be genetic testing to rule out a mitochondrial disease. This decision is supported by several key factors in the case:

1. Bilateral macular atrophy: The patient presents with bilateral macular atrophy, which is a common feature in mitochondrial diseases affecting the retina.

2. Sensorineural hearing loss: The patient has a history of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with cochlear origin. The combination of vision and hearing loss is characteristic of certain mitochondrial disorders, particularly Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome.

3. Headaches: The patient reports headaches since age 35, which can be another neurological manifestation of mitochondrial diseases.

4. Fundus autofluorescence pattern: The speckled pattern of alternating spots of increased and decreased autofluorescence is consistent with mitochondrial retinal dystrophies.

5. Optical coherence tomography findings: The bilateral atrophy of the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium is consistent with mitochondrial-related retinal degeneration.

6. Absence of family history: While there's no family history of hearing and vision loss, mitochondrial diseases can occur sporadically or have variable penetrance due to heteroplasmy.

7. Age of onset: The onset of symptoms in adulthood is consistent with some mitochondrial disorders.

Genetic testing for mitochondrial disease would help confirm the diagnosis and guide management. It would also provide valuable information for genetic counseling.

What Would You Do Next?",Pars plana vitrectomy,Laser barricade,Observation,Genetic testing for the RS1 gene,Macular retinoschisis in the setting of glaucomatous optic atrophy,C,Observation,"The patient’s decreased vision was due to macular retinoschisis, an abnormal splitting of the neuroretina associated with glaucomatous optic atrophy. Observation (choice C) is correct because the patient noted only mild distortion, and retinoschisis can remain stable1 or resolve spontaneously2,3 in up to 40% of cases.3 Schisis can resolve after vitrectomy,1 so surgery (choice A) could be pursued if symptoms worsened. Barrier laser (choice B), as described by Prinzi et al,4 has been used to treat retinoschisis in glaucoma; however, peripapillary laser photocoagulation carries risk of vision loss and the patient had only a 2-line decrease in vision. Testing for the RS1 gene (choice D) would be indicated if X-linked retinoschisis was suspected; however, this disease appears almost exclusively in boys.Retinoschisis is rare in patients with glaucoma, with a reported rate of 5.9%3 in 1 study. In this study, retinoschisis in glaucoma originated from the optic disc and overlapped with retinal nerve fiber layer defects, suggesting that schisis correlates with glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve head. Similarly, patients with schisis had worse visual field mean deviations compared with patients without.3 Approximately one-third of eyes with schisis also had an acquired optic disc pit (aODP).3 The relationship between glaucoma, aODPs, and retinoschisis is unclear. aODPs may represent areas of increased susceptibility owing to damage from glaucoma5 and could be an entry point for liquified vitreous to enter the retina, initiating retinoschisis.6 Therefore, the presence of an aODP in a patient with glaucoma could increase the likelihood of retinoschisis development. The patient had an optic disc pit that was visible on OCT imaging at the time of schisis onset (Figure 1B).The contribution of IOP to retinoschisis in glaucoma is not well understood. In 1 study, patients with glaucoma with retinoschisis at the initiation of the study had higher IOPs than patients without retinoschisis.3 However, retinoschisis has also been reported in normal tension glaucoma,7 suggesting high IOP is not a requisite for retinoschisis development. Patients who developed retinoschisis over time did not have changes in IOP before and after retinoschisis development, suggesting IOP fluctuations are not causative.3 Interestingly, resolution of retinoschisis was associated with either trabeculectomy or the initiation of IOP-lowering medications. Similarly, there are case reports of retinoschisis resolving after glaucoma surgery.1,8 In this patient, IOP had been well controlled prior to schisis development and no trigger could be identified, suggesting that it was the result of chronic glaucomatous damage rather than an acute process.In conclusion, the development of macular retinoschisis is associated with glaucoma and can cause decreased visual acuity in a patient with glaucoma, even with well-controlled IOP. Mild vision loss can be managed conservatively with observation.The patient was monitored with serial OCT imaging, which showed gradual improvement of the schisis over an 18-month period (Figure 2), with residual persistence along the nasal edge of the macula and return of visual acuity to baseline of 20/40 OU. The patient’s glaucoma continued to be successfully managed medically.Optical coherence tomography of macula at 18-month follow-up demonstrating retinoschisis involving fovea, improved from patient’s initial presentation but not resolved, with persistent schisis nasal to the fovea (arrowhead).",Ophthalmology,2021-09-01,2021,9,"A 70-year-old woman with an ocular history of primary open-angle glaucoma on latanoprost, bilateral trabeculectomies, and argon laser trabeculoplasties presented with several months of worsening vision in the left eye.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate next step would be observation (Option D). Here's the medical explanation for this decision:

1. Diagnosis: The patient's OCT findings, particularly the ""schiticlike separation of the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers extending from the temporal edge of the optic nerve head to the fovea,"" are consistent with optic pit maculopathy. This is further supported by the mention of an optic pit in the OCT of the optic nerve head.

2. Condition stability: The patient's symptoms have developed over several months, and her visual acuity, while slightly decreased, is still relatively good at 20/60 in the affected eye. This suggests a slowly progressing condition.

3. Lack of urgent intervention need: Optic pit maculopathy can sometimes resolve spontaneously, and immediate intervention is not always necessary, especially when visual acuity is relatively preserved.

4. Risks vs. Benefits: More invasive options like pars plana vitrectomy (Option A) carry surgical risks and should be considered only if the condition worsens or significantly impacts the patient's quality of life.

5. Inappropriate options: Genetic testing for the RS1 gene (Option B) is not relevant as this is typically associated with X-linked retinoschisis, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation. Laser barricade (Option C) is not a standard treatment for optic pit maculopathy.

Given these factors, observation is the most appropriate next step. This allows for monitoring of the condition's progression without exposing the patient to unnecessary risks. If the condition worsens or if visual acuity significantly decreases, more aggressive treatment options can be considered at that time.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

IVCM (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph 3 with Rostock Cornea Module; Heidelberg) of the anterior stroma (Figure 1B) revealed a collection of hyperreflective septate branching hyphae, compatible with filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus, Fusarium, and rarely Purpureocillium lilacinum (PL). The diagnosis of filamentous fungal keratitis was made, and therapy was started with topical voriconazole (choice C), in addition to oral voriconazole.Vancomycin (choice A) is commonly used as empirical therapy for moderate to severe corneal infections, since gram-positive bacteria are a frequent etiologic microbe. However, IVCM findings suggested a fungal etiology for this ulcer. Fluconazole (choice B) is an azole antifungal agent with great efficacy against yeast, such as Candida species. Filamentous fungi are better treated with voriconazole or natamycin. Lastly IVCM demonstrated the presence of hyphae, which are elongated branching structures, unlike acanthamoeba, which typically presents as hyperreflective double-walled cystic lesions. Therefore, polyhexamethylene biguanide and propamidine isethionate were not indicated (choice D).PL (formerly known as Paecilomyces lilacinus) is a filamentous fungus found throughout the world in decomposing plants and soil.1 In a series of 28 patients with PL keratitis,2 CL use represented the biggest risk factor, present in 71% of patients. Thus, even in the absence of trauma with organic material or corneal surgery, CL use should raise the suspicion for filamentous keratitis. Other known risk factors include trauma1 and immunosuppression.3 However, 1 study found PL keratitis was most common in individuals with an absent ocular history.4 Prognosis is variable and better when linked to a timely diagnosis. Presentations may range from rapidly resolving keratitis to endophthalmitis requiring enucleation.3 Importantly, patients presenting 2 weeks after onset of disease, or who had received prior steroids, carry a significantly worse visual prognosis.2 Thus, for ulcers recalcitrant to initial treatment, we recommend prompt referral to a cornea specialist.Unlike other filamentous fungi, PL does not reliably respond to commonly used topical antifungals such as natamycin and amphotericin B; thus, early diagnosis is critical to direct accurate treatment. Effective treatment regimens may include topical voriconazole, oral terbinafine, and oral voriconazole.3 In refractory cases, oral posaconazole has also shown efficacy.5 The role of IVCM is crucial to rapidly diagnose fungal etiologies. Prior studies of patients with microbial keratitis demonstrated that confocal microscopy had a diagnostic sensitivity of 71% to 94% and a specificity of 78% to 89.6% for fungal keratitis.6,7In summary, P lilacinum is a rare, yet potentially devastating corneal pathogen if not diagnosed early. IVCM, if available to the clinician, should be performed on suspected microbial keratitis, especially when cases progress despite empirical treatments or have negative culture results.After 1 week of treatment with topical and oral voriconazole, corneal edema was significantly decreased, the epithelium had healed, and conjunctival hyperemia was improving.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate empirical treatment while awaiting the results of repeated corneal cultures is option C: Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and propamidine isethionate.

The key factors that support this decision are:

1. History of contact lens wear: The patient has a history of daily soft contact lens use, which is a significant risk factor for Acanthamoeba keratitis.

2. Recent freshwater exposure: The patient had recently been swimming in a freshwater lake prior to the onset of the ulcer. Acanthamoeba is commonly found in freshwater environments.

3. Recalcitrant nature of the ulcer: The case describes a ""recalcitrant central corneal ulcer"" that did not respond well to initial treatment with besifloxacin and loteprednol.

4. Clinical presentation: The patient's symptoms worsened after initial improvement, which is characteristic of Acanthamoeba keratitis. The presence of stromal infiltrate and microcystic corneal edema are also consistent with this diagnosis.

5. Negative initial cultures: The initial negative cultures for bacteria suggest that the infection is likely not bacterial in nature.

6. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM): Although the specific IVCM findings are not described, the fact that IVCM was performed suggests a high suspicion for Acanthamoeba keratitis, as this imaging technique is particularly useful for detecting Acanthamoeba cysts in the corneal stroma.

Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and propamidine isethionate are the first-line treatments for Acanthamoeba keratitis. These agents are effective against both the trophozoite and cyst forms of Acanthamoeba. Starting this treatment empirically while awaiting culture results is crucial, as early treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis significantly improves outcomes and reduces the risk of severe corneal damage.

The other options (voriconazole, vancomycin, and fluconazole) are less appropriate in this case. Voriconazole and fluconazole are antifungal agents, while vancomycin is an antibiotic. Given the clinical presentation and risk factors, these treatments are less likely to be effective against the suspected Acanthamoeba infection.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

A 2 × 2-mm stromal opacity was noted paracentrally with no epithelial defects. The anterior chamber demonstrated 1+ cell. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OS. Corneal cultures for bacteria, fungi, and acanthamoeba were repeated, and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was performed on the stromal infiltrate (Figure 1B).

</options>",7.06163477897644,"content='Answer - C\n\n[Explanation]\nBased on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate empirical treatment while awaiting the results of repeated corneal cultures is option C: Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and propamidine isethionate.\n\nThe key factors that support this decision are:\n\n1. History of contact lens wear: The patient has a history of daily soft contact lens use, which is a significant risk factor for Acanthamoeba keratitis.\n\n2. Recent freshwater exposure: The patient had recently been swimming in a freshwater lake prior to the onset of the ulcer. Acanthamoeba is commonly found in freshwater environments.\n\n3. Recalcitrant nature of the ulcer: The case describes a ""recalcitrant central corneal ulcer"" that did not respond well to initial treatment with besifloxacin and loteprednol.\n\n4. Clinical presentation: The patient\'s symptoms worsened after initial improvement, which is characteristic of Acanthamoeba keratitis. The presence of stromal infiltrate and microcystic corneal edema are also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n5. Negative initial cultures: The initial negative cultures for bacteria suggest that the infection is likely not bacterial in nature.\n\n6. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM): Although the specific IVCM findings are not described, the fact that IVCM was performed suggests a high suspicion for Acanthamoeba keratitis, as this imaging technique is particularly useful for detecting Acanthamoeba cysts in the corneal stroma.\n\nPolyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and propamidine isethionate are the first-line treatments for Acanthamoeba keratitis. These agents are effective against both the trophozoite and cyst forms of Acanthamoeba. Starting this treatment empirically while awaiting culture results is crucial, as early treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis significantly improves outcomes and reduces the risk of severe corneal damage.\n\nThe other options (voriconazole, vancomycin, and fluconazole) are less appropriate in this case. Voriconazole and fluconazole are antifungal agents, while vancomycin is an antibiotic. Given the clinical presentation and risk factors, these treatments are less likely to be effective against the suspected Acanthamoeba infection.' response_metadata={'id': 'msg_vrtx_01GJA5ak2NKEBnRQUZLfe4RF', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 683, 'output_tokens': 555}} id='run-b5040cbd-838c-42b0-b714-9c3e80fee066-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 683, 'output_tokens': 555, 'total_tokens': 1238}",0.0

With negative laboratory findings for autoimmune or inflammatory disease, there is no indication to start high-dose corticosteroids (choice C). The patient had persistent visual field deficits despite acetazolamide use, which requires further investigation beyond monitoring with serial testing (choice D). A repeated lumbar puncture (choice B) revealed an opening pressure of 18 cm H2O, an IgG level of 6.6 mg/dL (normal range, 0.5 to 5.9 mg/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01), and 4 oligoclonal bands (normal range, 0 to 1). Throughout this workup, the patient began to develop new neurological symptoms, including persistent left cranial nerve V numbness, paresthesia, fatigue, cold intolerance, throbbing headache, and bradyphrenia (ie, slowing of cognition).A repeated brain magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venogram of the head showed no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis but identified multifocal enhancing and nonenhancing signal abnormalities of the brain at the callososeptal interface, juxtacortical regions, basal ganglia, and brainstem. In light of these findings and given the cerebrospinal fluid serology results, the patient was urgently referred for neuroinflammatory evaluation. A few weeks later, the patient was hospitalized after developing sudden-onset confusion. During his hospitalization, an extensive workup of serum and cerebrospinal fluid studies for infectious, autoimmune, and demyelinating diseases was performed. Within the context of this patient’s clinical course, a brain biopsy that showed histopathologic features suspicious for vasculitis helped determine the diagnosis (Figure 2).The brain biopsy revealed very mild perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammation with inflammatory cell infiltration, composed mainly of histiocytes and T cells, few B cells, and scattered neutrophils and distortion of the cortical vessel wall (black arrowhead).Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is a rare idiopathic disorder characterized by vasculitis confined to the brain and spinal cord. The clinical spectrum of PACNS remains poorly understood given its diverse and nonspecific clinical manifestations.2 Headache is the most common symptom, occurring in roughly 60% of patients. Ocular abnormalities occur in 41% of cases, including visual-field defect (18%), diplopia (14%), blurred vision or decreased visual acuity (11%), and papilledema (4.3%).3,4 Diagnosing PACNS frequently involves a combination of clinical findings: an unexplained neurological deficit, laboratory workup that rules out secondary causes of central nervous system vasculitis, imaging findings, and/or histopathologic features of vasculitis on brain biopsy.2,5,6 Treatment of PACNS includes induction therapy of high-dose glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide with periodic reassessment of neurologic symptoms and neuroimaging for treatment response. Maintenance therapy with a corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent, such as azathioprine, is typically started after 4 to 6 months. Favorable response to treatment is reportedly greater than 80%.4,7The patient’s cognitive function showed remarkable improvement following induction of glucocorticoids in combination with cyclophosphamide at 7-month follow-up.",Ophthalmology,2021-08-01,2021,8,"A 58-year-old man with a history of hypertensive retinopathy presented with acute-onset, painless vision loss in his right eye accompanied by tinnitus and severe intermittent headaches.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to continue acetazolamide and repeat Humphrey visual fields test and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retinal nerve fiber layer in 3 months.

This decision is based on several factors:

1. Initial presentation and diagnosis: The patient initially presented with symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), including optic nerve edema and an elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture. This clinical picture is consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

2. Current status: After 4 months of treatment with acetazolamide, the patient has shown improvement. His visual acuity has improved from 20/400 to 20/50 in the right eye, and the optic nerve edema has resolved, although there is residual optic nerve pallor.

3. Exclusion of other causes: Extensive workup, including imaging and serological tests, has ruled out other potential causes of optic neuropathy.

4. Current treatment: Acetazolamide is the standard first-line treatment for IIH. The patient has shown improvement on this medication, suggesting it is effective.

5. Need for follow-up: While the patient has improved, he still has residual visual deficits and optic nerve pallor. Regular follow-up is crucial to monitor the progression of the condition and the effectiveness of the treatment.

Continuing acetazolamide and repeating visual field testing and OCT in 3 months allows for:
- Ongoing treatment of the underlying condition (IIH)
- Monitoring of visual function through visual field testing
- Assessment of structural changes in the optic nerve through OCT

This approach provides a balance between active treatment and careful monitoring, allowing for adjustments in management if needed based on objective measures of visual function and structure.

The other options are less appropriate:
A. High-dose corticosteroids are not typically used for IIH and could potentially worsen the condition.
B. While blood pressure control is important in a patient with hypertensive retinopathy, it is not the primary issue here.
C. A repeated lumbar puncture is not necessary at this point, given the patient's improvement and the initial diagnostic workup.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

He denied any difficulty with his speech, swallowing, weakness, or sensory changes.He presented to the emergency department, and the emergency department physician reported a normal neurological examination result apart from the right-sided ptosis and limited eye movements. He was referred to ophthalmology and had a visual acuity of 20/20 OU. Both pupils were equal sizes and reactive to light. He was found to only have a complete limitation of elevation of his right eye and a limitation of abduction in his left eye (Figure). He was orthophoric in primary position, and there were no eyelid twitches. Orbicularis oculi strength was reduced on both sides. A dilated fundus examination had normal results bilaterally.

This combination of examination findings cannot be localized in the central nervous system, because there is involvement of the levator muscle and superior rectus on the right (innervated by cranial nerve III) and the lateral rectus on the left (innervated by cranial nerve VI). This should raise concern for ocular myasthenia gravis, and a readily accessible test in the clinic is an ice pack test or rest test, which should result in an improvement in the ptosis, as was seen in this patient. His palpebral fissure measured 1 mm before ice was applied and 6 mm 5 minutes after the application of ice. The ice test has been reported to have a sensitivity of 0.94% and specificity of 0.97% in ocular myasthenia1 and is based on the principle that cooler temperatures result in reduced acetylcholinesterase activity.1 It involves placing ice on the involved eyelid for at least 2 minutes and comparing the pretest to posttest measurements. The test is considered to have positive results when there is an increase in the size of the palpebral fissure compared with the pretest measurement.This patient had no symptoms of giant cell arteritis, such as headache, scalp tenderness, or jaw claudication, and he was relatively young for this condition, which is why choice A was not the next best option. Neuroimaging would not be the next best step, because his examination findings could not be localized. Computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography would be indicated in a third nerve palsy, but this patient did not have this, which is why choice B was not correct. He had no orbital signs (eg, proptosis, conjunctival chemosis, eyelid retraction), and an orbital lesion would not explain the ptosis, which is why choice C was not correct.Ocular myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction confined to the ocular muscles. In ocular myasthenia gravis, autoantibodies develop against the acetylcholine receptors (commonly) or other associated proteins at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigability.2 Patients typically present with ptosis and diplopia that is worse with muscle use, with normal pupil reactions. While more than 85% of patients with the systemic variant have detectable autoantibodies in their serum, patients with the ocular variant have 45% to 60% sensitivity with the same test.3 In seronegative ocular myasthenia gravis, single-fiber electromyography may be used to evaluate neuromuscular transmission.4 In this patient, serum acetylcholine receptor antibody tests had negative results, but single-fiber electromyography was highly suggestive of a postsynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder.Initial therapy for ocular myasthenia gravis consists of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as 30 to 150 mg of pyridostigmine 3 to 4 times daily.5 Many patients need additional immunosuppression for full clinical remission, including prednisone, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil.6 Approximately two-thirds of patients with ocular myasthenia gravis will progress to systemic disease,7 and patients should be counseled on seeking medical attention if they have clinically significant sequelae, such as difficulty breathing.The patient’s ptosis and diplopia mildly improved with 60 mg of pyridostigmine 3 times daily, and prednisone daily was started at 10 mg and titrated up to 40 mg, resulting in complete remission. At his 6-month follow-up, a slow taper of prednisone was initiated because he continued to have no ptosis and normal ocular motility.",Ophthalmology,2021-07-01,2021,7,"A 54-year-old man presented with a 3-day history of right ptosis and double vision.

[Explanation]
The ice pack test is the most appropriate next step in this clinical scenario. The patient's presentation strongly suggests ocular myasthenia gravis (MG), a localized form of myasthenia gravis affecting the extraocular muscles and eyelids.

Key features supporting this diagnosis include:
1. Fluctuating symptoms (initially worse at the end of the day)
2. Ptosis and diplopia
3. Limited eye movements
4. Reduced orbicularis oculi strength bilaterally
5. Otherwise normal neurological examination

The ice pack test is a simple, non-invasive, and quick diagnostic tool for ocular myasthenia gravis. It involves applying an ice pack to the affected eye for 2-5 minutes. In patients with MG, cold temperature improves neuromuscular transmission, potentially leading to temporary improvement in ptosis.

While other options like imaging studies (A and D) or blood tests (B) might be considered in the diagnostic workup, they are not the most immediate or specific next step for confirming the suspected diagnosis of ocular myasthenia gravis. The ice pack test provides a rapid, bedside assessment that can guide further management and more specific testing, such as acetylcholine receptor antibody tests or electromyography with repetitive nerve stimulation.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

The pneumonia responded to antibiotic therapy, while the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels normalized.Trigeminal trophic syndrome is a rare disease following peripheral or central damage to the fifth cranial nerve.1,2 Unilateral ulcers in the sensory distribution of the trigeminal nerve are characteristic.2 The ulcers are most frequently located in the area supplied by the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, that is, on the nasal ala, cheek, and upper lip, sparing the nasal tip.2 Hypoesthesia is often combined with paresthesia in the form of a burning, crawling, and itching sensation. As a result, self-inflicted lesions develop, secondary to unconscious traumatic rubbing and scratching.2 Like skin ulcers from external trauma in general, they typically have sharply demarcated, pauci-inflammatory borders and can be geometrically shaped. There is also the lack of a primary lesion such as pustule, vesicle, or inflammatory papule.In this patient, trigeminal trophic syndrome developed as a complication of an iatrogenic embolic stroke secondary to coronary angiography, affecting the trigeminal nuclei in the brainstem. Other possible causes include medical interventions, such as trigeminal nerve ablation or removal of the gasserian ganglion for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, tumors (astrocytoma or meningioma), infections (herpes zoster, syphilis, or leprosy), and syringobulbia.2 The time between nerve damage and the appearance of ulceration ranges from a few weeks to several years.1,2 In the cases documented so far, the age of the patients ranged from 14 months to 94 years, and women were affected somewhat more often than men.2Careful history and physical examination are essential for making the correct diagnosis. We refrained from obtaining a skin biopsy in this patient as the history and neurological findings were in keeping with the clinical diagnosis, and the results of the neuroimaging studies fitted the expected area of infarction. However, in less clear-cut cases, a biopsy should be considered to exclude malignancy, vasculitis, and other differential diagnoses. Histology from an ulcer due to trigeminal trophic syndrome would show a nonspecific inflammatory reaction.3Because of the rarity of trigeminal trophic syndrome, there are no standardized therapy guidelines. It is important to explain to patients that the ulcers are self-induced. To avoid further injury, patients should keep their fingernails short and wear cotton gloves at night.2 Occlusive dressings are also helpful.1 Carbamazepine or gabapentin may be prescribed to combat paresthesia.2 Plastic surgery may become necessary to cover large cutaneous defects.1Giant cell arteritis is a systemic vasculitis of the large and medium vessels that can lead to scalp necrosis.4 However, the resulting ulceration is usually limited to the frontotemporal region and is accompanied by headache, visual disturbances, and jaw claudication. These symptoms were absent in this patient. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level in this patient were likely due to pneumonia and resolved with antibiotic treatment.Herpes zoster involving the trigeminal nerve may also result in necrosis and facial erosions. Unlike the clinical presentation in this patient, trigeminal zoster is typically limited to only one division of the fifth cranial nerve. In addition, the protracted and progressive course would be unusual in an immunocompetent patient.Finally, pyoderma gangrenosum should be considered in the context of sudden-onset progressive ulceration. However, the typical features, including undermined violaceous edge and pain, were not present in this patient.",Neurology,2021-07-01,2021,7,"A 66-year-old man presented with multiple progressive ulcers on the right side of his face that had developed over the past 3 months (Figure, A).

[Explanation]
The most appropriate diagnosis for this case is Trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS). This condition is characterized by the development of facial ulcers following damage to the trigeminal nerve or its central sensory connections. Several key features of this case support this diagnosis:

1. Unilateral facial ulcers: The patient presents with multiple progressive ulcers limited to the right side of his face, which is a hallmark of TTS.

2. Neurological deficit: The patient experiences hypoesthesia (decreased sensation) on the right side of his face, indicating trigeminal nerve involvement.

3. Recent neurological event: The patient suffered a posterior circulation stroke involving the brainstem, which likely affected the trigeminal nerve pathway. TTS often occurs following stroke, particularly those affecting the brainstem.

4. Timing: The ulcers developed approximately 2 weeks after the stroke, which is consistent with the typical onset of TTS following a neurological insult.

5. Absence of other symptoms: The patient denies headache, jaw pain, or visual disturbances, which helps rule out other conditions like giant cell arteritis.

While the elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) might suggest an inflammatory condition, these can also be elevated in the context of recent stroke and concurrent pneumonia.

Trigeminal herpes zoster (B) is less likely as it typically presents with a painful vesicular rash following a dermatomal distribution and would not persist for 3 months. Pyoderma gangrenosum (C) usually affects the lower extremities and is associated with systemic diseases not mentioned in this case. Giant cell arteritis (D) typically presents with headache, jaw claudication, and visual symptoms, which are absent in this patient.

Given the clinical presentation, recent stroke affecting the brainstem, and the characteristic unilateral facial ulcers with sensory deficit, Trigeminal trophic syndrome is the most fitting diagnosis.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

He had systemic hypertension, which occurs in most patients with endogenous hypercortisolism,1,2 and elevated intraocular pressure, which has been reported in endogenous hypercortisolism and can be caused by corticosteroid use.3,4 His hemoglobin A1c level was elevated (6.8%), which is consistent with impaired glucose metabolism in endogenous hypercortisolism.2Fluorescein angiography showed multiple areas of late pinpoint leakage and guttering, which is patchy, mottled hyperfluorescence caused by gravity-related descending tracts of subretinal fluid (Figure 1). These fluorescein angiography findings are typical of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), which is characterized by serous detachment of neurosensory retina/retinal pigment epithelium (Figure 2) and choroidal hyperpermeability. The leakage on fluorescein angiography is most consistent with active CSC, whereas the patches of mottled fluorescence are more typical of chronic CSC.Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) of the right eye indicating detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium (arrowhead) (A).

The left eye (not shown) had similar findings.The patient denied corticosteroid exposure; given the possibility of hypercortisolism of unknown cause, he was referred to the endocrinology unit for further evaluation. Cortisol testing (choice C) was performed and showed elevated 8 am plasma cortisol (15.2 µg/dL; to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 27.588). Overnight challenge with 1 mg of dexamethasone resulted in an 8 am plasma cortisol of 17.8 µg/dL, confirming hypercortisolism. Adrenocorticotropic hormone levels were not suppressed, raising suspicion for a central cause of hypercortisolism. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling confirmed a central source of adrenocorticotropic hormone, and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pituitary microadenoma.The differential diagnosis for this case included CSC associated with exogenous, or rarely, endogenous hypercortisolism, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy or pathologic myopia with choroidal neovascularization, and paraproteinemia. However, the patient’s relatively young age and lack of drusen were not consistent with age-related macular degeneration. Moreover, the patient lacked polypoidal lesions on indocyanine green angiography findings, making polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy less likely. The patient did not have myopia, making pathologic myopia unlikely. Intravitreal injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent (choice A) would be an appropriate treatment for CSC with choroidal neovascularization but not in this patient without choroidal neovascularization.5,6 Bilateral retinal pigment epithelium detachments can also be found in paraproteinemia, although the patient had normal blood cell counts and did not report any B-signs of malignancy. Therefore, bone marrow biopsy (choice D) was not indicated.Neither oral spironolactone (choice B), a mineralocorticoid antagonist, nor eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, improve visual acuity in patients with CSC.7,8 A workup for underlying causes of hypercortisolism (choice C) should be considered prior to retinal management of CSC in a patient with Cushingoid appearance. Risk factors for CSC include corticosteroid use in any form.9 CSC is rarely caused by endogenous hypercortisolism.10 Ophthalmologists should be cognizant that while Cushing syndrome is most commonly caused by corticosteroid-containing medications, it may also result from an adrenocorticotropic hormone–secreting pituitary tumor (Cushing disease).The patient underwent transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary microadenoma.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to draw morning plasma cortisol levels (Option D). This decision is based on several key factors in the case:

1. Central obesity: The external photograph (Figure 1A) shows central obesity, which is a characteristic feature of Cushing's syndrome.

2. Ocular findings: The patient presents with bilateral blurry vision, elevated intraocular pressure (>21 mm Hg on multiple visits), and fluorescein angiography showing multiple areas of late pinpoint leakage and patches of mottled hyperfluorescence in both eyes. These findings are consistent with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), which can be associated with elevated cortisol levels.

3. Medical history: The patient has a history of hypertension and left adrenalectomy, both of which can be associated with endocrine disorders, particularly those affecting the adrenal glands.

4. Absence of other risk factors: The patient denies corticosteroid use, sleep apnea, or type-A personality, which are common risk factors for CSCR. This absence of typical risk factors raises suspicion for an underlying endocrine disorder.

Drawing morning plasma cortisol levels is crucial to evaluate for Cushing's syndrome, which could explain both the ocular findings (CSCR) and the systemic features (central obesity, hypertension). Cushing's syndrome is characterized by excessive cortisol production, which can lead to various systemic and ocular manifestations.

The other options are less appropriate in this context:
- Option A (Intravitreal anti-VEGF injection) is not the first-line treatment for suspected CSCR, especially without confirming the underlying cause.
- Option B (Bone marrow biopsy) is not indicated as there are no signs suggestive of paraproteinemias.
- Option C (Oral spironolactone) could be considered for CSCR treatment, but it's premature without first investigating the underlying cause.

Therefore, drawing morning plasma cortisol levels is the most appropriate next step to investigate the potential underlying endocrine disorder causing the patient's ocular and systemic symptoms.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy,B,Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy,"Evidence of motor dysfunction in multiple cranial nerves, marked distal muscle weakness and atrophy, and significant neurogenic lesions on muscle biopsy indicate axonal damage of multiple nerves or lesions of motor nuclei of the brainstem and spinal anterior horn. Meanwhile, facial sensory disturbance and the absence of the blink reflex suggests trigeminal nerve involvement. Juvenile and insidious onset and unrelenting gradual disease progression are indicative of genetic, degenerative, and metabolic diseases.Lesions with sensory and motor neuron involvement, including syringomyelia and syringobulbia, Sjögren syndrome, vasculitis, certain metabolic disorders, and immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy were precluded by negative laboratory, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological results. The normal lipid profile excluded Tangier disease, a rare autosomal recessive disorder with variants in the ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 gene (ABC1), characterized by reduced high-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein A through I.1 Multiple axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, in conjunction with pyramidal signs, may be linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2 with KIF5A, GDAP1, SPG11, MFN2, and GJB1 variants2; however, facial and trigeminal nerve involvement is rare. The involvement of upper and lower motor neurons may be linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); however, clinical symptoms related to sensory involvement and the absence of the blink reflex could not be explained by an ALS diagnosis.The clinical, electrophysiological, and biopsy results of this patient were most consistent with a diagnosis of facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN).3 Although uncommon, adolescent onset and signs suggesting upper motor neuron involvement have been reported in FOSMN.4-6FOSMN is a rare primary neurodegenerative disease first described by Vucic et al3 in 2006. The mean (range) age at onset of this disease is approximately 55 (38-83) years, with a single case of childhood-onset reported.6 Furthermore, the course and prognosis can vary significantly. This syndrome typically begins with sensory and motor symptoms associated with areas innervated by the trigeminal nerve and spreads to the bulbar, neck, and arms in a rostrocaudal direction.3 In some cases, patients initially report bulbar symptoms, such as dysarthria and dysphagia.4 As the disease progresses, cramps, fasciculations, and bulbar symptoms present, and patients with upper motor neuron impairment usually progress more rapidly.5 The abnormal blink reflex manifests with a delayed or absent R2 response and provides useful evidence for diagnosis.3 Reduced amplitudes of sensory nerve action potential were generally observed in the nerve conduction study, and chronic neurogenic changes and denervation-reinnervation changes were observed on electromyography.3 Neurogenic damage discovered in muscle biopsy, neuronal loss, and reactive gliosis are observed not only in the motor nucleus but also in the sensory nucleus and spinal trigeminal tract.3 The diagnosis of FOSMN is mainly based on the patient’s medical history and clinical presentation.To our knowledge, the pathogenesis and causative genes remain to be explored. Because of the presence of autoantibodies in several patients, the participation of immune mechanisms should be considered.7 As neuropathological studies of patients with FOSMN found transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)–positive glial inclusions8 and a heterozygous D90A-SOD1 variant was discovered in a patient9—although whether the variant in this patient was pathogenic or a polymorphism is unclear—there may be a connection to ALS. However, compared with the cortical hyperexcitability observed in ALS, the cortical excitability in patients with FOSMN is normal,10 suggesting that FOSMN may be a variant of ALS.",Neurology,2021-07-01,2021,7,"A 19-year-old man presented with 4 years of facial numbness and 3 years of progressive dysarthria and dysphagia.

[Explanation]
The clinical presentation and findings in this case are most consistent with Facial Onset Sensory and Motor Neuronopathy (FOSMN). This rare neurological disorder is characterized by the following features, which are present in this patient:

1. Onset with facial sensory symptoms: The patient presented with 4 years of facial numbness, which is typically the initial symptom in FOSMN.

2. Progressive involvement of motor functions: The patient developed dysarthria and dysphagia after 1 year, followed by arm weakness and hand atrophy, and then leg weakness. This pattern of progression from facial onset to bulbar and limb involvement is characteristic of FOSMN.

3. Sensory and motor deficits: The patient exhibits reduced facial touch and vibration sensitivity, as well as muscle weakness and atrophy in multiple areas.

4. Absence of reflexes: Corneal reflexes and bilateral biceps and triceps reflexes were absent, which is consistent with FOSMN.

5. Normal imaging and laboratory findings: MRI and various blood tests were normal, which helps rule out other conditions.

6. Electrophysiological findings: The nerve conduction study showed reduced compound muscle action potential and sensory nerve action potential, indicating axonal damage, which is consistent with FOSMN.

7. Chronic neurogenic changes: The muscle biopsy demonstrated severe neurogenic damage, supporting the diagnosis of FOSMN.

The other options are less likely:
- Juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) typically has a more rapid progression and doesn't usually present with sensory symptoms.
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2 usually has a more symmetrical presentation and doesn't typically affect facial nerves early in the disease course.
- Tangier disease is a rare genetic disorder of lipid metabolism that can cause neuropathy, but it usually presents with other systemic symptoms and abnormal lipid profiles, which are not present in this case.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, progression, and findings, Facial Onset Sensory and Motor Neuronopathy (FOSMN) is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

The differential diagnosis for these findings in the macula includes inherited retinal disorders (eg, X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, Goldmann-Favre syndrome), medications (eg, antimicrotubular agents), vascular insults (eg, retinal vein occlusion), and trauma. In this case, the presence of an epiretinal membrane with pathologic myopia was suggestive of foveoschisis. Visualization can be supplemented by en face images and vitreoretinal interface segmentation. Myopic foveoschisis, typically with associated features, including staphyloma,1 can be associated with substantial visual acuity loss that may not always be correctable with surgical intervention. These problems are often compounded by other visual acuity loss from pathologic myopia, such as myopic degeneration in the posterior pole, in addition to epiretinal proliferation or dense remnants of cortical vitreous following posterior vitreous detachment. Foveoschisis does not always have to be accompanied by epiretinal membrane, and the causative mechanism of myopic foveoschisis remains unknown.1Given mild visual impairment for this patient, observation was elected (choice D) instead of opting for surgical peeling (choice A). Surgery is warranted if there is substantial visual impairment, assessed through BCVA and metamorphopsia by Amsler grid testing. Judgment involves determining the effect on function by considering the patient’s occupation and activities of daily living. It is often reasonable to monitor for clear disease progression before proceeding with vitrectomy and membrane peeling. Many cases are successful with both epiretinal and internal limiting membrane peeling for reducing recurrence.2Periocular steroids (choice B) may benefit macular edema arising from diabetes or inflammatory conditions, but they are unlikely to be helpful for this causative mechanism of retinoschisis. Carbonic anhydrase inhibition (choice C) with either topical dorzolamide or oral acetazolamide is known to help macular edema associated with retinitis pigmentosa, but it is not typically used for retinoschisis.Spontaneous resolution of foveoschisis without intervention has been reported, independent of the status of the posterior hyaloid.1,3-5 Release of epiretinal membrane and posterior hyaloid may follow known age-associated changes at the vitreomacular attachment interface.6 Close observation is therefore reasonable in select cases, depending on impairment and overall clinical context. Additional research is needed to further characterize the natural history of this condition, including frequency of progression, spontaneous resolution, and recurrence.Four years after presentation and electing observation, the patient returned with resolution of the foveoschisis and release of posterior hyaloid. She achieved 20/20 OU visual acuity, which was sustained 9 years later (Figure 2).A, Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showing resolution of the foveoschisis and release of the posterior hyaloid and epiretinal membrane.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate next step would be observation without considering intervention unless visual acuity deterioration is found (Option C).

The patient presents with mild, long-standing blurred vision and slight metamorphopsia in the right eye, with a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/25. This indicates that her vision is only mildly affected, and her daily functioning is likely not significantly impaired.

The optical coherence tomography (OCT) reveals an epiretinal membrane and foveoschisis, which are common findings in highly myopic eyes. While these findings explain her symptoms, they do not necessarily warrant immediate surgical intervention given the mild nature of her visual complaints and good visual acuity.

Surgical intervention, such as vitrectomy with membrane peeling (Option B), carries risks including cataract formation, retinal detachment, and potential worsening of vision. Given the patient's relatively good vision and mild symptoms, the risks of surgery may outweigh the potential benefits at this time.

Observation is a reasonable approach in this case because:
1. The patient's vision is only mildly affected (20/25 BCVA).
2. The condition appears to be stable and long-standing.
3. There is no evidence of rapid progression or severe vision loss.

The recommendation to observe and intervene only if visual acuity deteriorates allows for monitoring of the condition while avoiding unnecessary risks associated with more aggressive treatments. If the patient's vision worsens significantly or if she develops more severe symptoms, then surgical intervention could be reconsidered at that time.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Cobalamin C deficiency,B,Cobalamin C deficiency,"This teenager presented with subacute-onset spastic gait and homocysteine elevation. Homocysteinemia can be acquired or inherited with or without methylmalonic acidemia. His age, normal vitamin and folate levels, and lack of intrinsic factor antibodies suggested an inherited metabolic disorder. Elevation of methylmalonic acid (MMA) narrowed the differential diagnosis.Methylmalonic acidemia with homocysteinemia is caused by defects in the absorption, transportation, and metabolism of cobalamin.1 Normally, after entering the cell, cobalamin is reduced to cobalamin II through functions of cobalamin F, J, C, and D. Next, cobalamin II is converted to methyl-cobalamin, remethylating homocysteine to methionine. Alternatively, cobalamin II can be converted to adenosyl-cobalamin, a cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Blocking this step results in accumulation of L-methylmalonyl-CoA metabolites, which include MMA and methyl citrate acid. Therefore, any defect affecting conversion of cobalamin to cobalamin II will cause simultaneous elevations in homocysteine and MMA, leading to neuronal and endothelial dysfunctions. A cobalamin C (CblC) deficiency (choice B) is most likely. Hereditary spastic paraplegia (choice A) can present with spastic gait, encephalopathy, and seizure but cannot explain the abnormal biochemical results. Cystathionine β-synthase and methionine synthase catalyze conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine and methionine, respectively. Although defects in cystathionine β-synthase (choice C) or cobalamin G or methionine synthase (choice D) can cause homocysteinemia, neither leads to elevated MMA because adenosylcobalamin is unaffected.Whole-exome genetic sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variations (exon 4: p.Arg161Gln; p.Trp203Ter) in the patient’s MMACHC gene, confirming late-onset CblC deficiency. Folate, methyl-cobalamin, and levocarnitine were prescribed. One month later, the homocysteine level was 4.08 mg/L and his gait had slightly improved. The slow recovery may have been because of delayed diagnosis.Deficiency in CblC is autosomal recessive. It is the most common intracellular cobalaminopathy, with an incidence estimated at 1 per 3920 individuals in Shandong province, China; 1 per 60 000 in California; and 1 per 37 000 in the US Hispanic population.2,3 Early-onset forms typically manifest as poor feeding, lethargy, developmental delay, and microcephaly in the neonatal period. Late-onset forms present in adolescence or adulthood and are often triggered by dehydration, vegan diet, infection, or pregnancy. Clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and include encephalopathy, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, dystonia, ataxia, gait abnormality, thromboembolic events, cytopenia, chronic kidney disease, and optic nerve atrophy. Severity varies from no symptoms to multisystemic involvement.4 Neuroradiological features are nonspecific and may include cerebral atrophy, edema, leukoencephalopathy, infarction, corpus callosum thinning, and abnormal signals in the basal ganglia region. Spinal cord imaging features may mimic subacute combined degeneration, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, and syringomyelia.5 Biochemical abnormalities provide important diagnostic clues. Organic acid profiling is characterized by elevations in MMA and methyl citrate acid. Since carnitine binds acyl residues to aid the excretion of propionyl-CoA, patients may show increases in propionyl carnitine levels (>5 μmol/L) and propionyl carnitine–acetyl carnitine ratio (>0.25) (Figure 2).6 Confirmatory diagnosis requires gene sequencing. Treatment is aimed at decreasing MMA levels, promoting homocysteine-to-methionine conversion, and accelerating acyl carnitine clearance. Long-term use of parenteral hydroxocobalamin, methyl-cobalamin, or betaine; folate; and L-carnitine is warranted.4 Available treatments may be region-specific, and a metabolic physician should be consulted. Protein restriction is not recommended. Urine MMA and serum homocysteine levels should be monitored. Diagnosing a late-onset CblC deficiency is challenging because of its rarity and heterogeneity. This case highlights the value of screening for methylmalonic acidemia when facing spastic gait of unknown cause and importance of early treatment to avoid irreversible neurological complications.Serum amino acid and acyl carnitine analysis using the tandem mass spectrometry method showed increased propionyl carnitine levels (7.6 μmol/L) and propionyl carnitine/acetyl carnitine ratio (0.65) in the patient sample (A) vs a normal control (B). cps indicates counts per second.",Neurology,2021-06-01,2021,6,"A 13-year-old boy with an unsteady gait was referred for evaluation.

[Explanation]
The most likely diagnosis for this 13-year-old boy is Cobalamin G or methionine synthase deficiency. This conclusion is based on several key factors from the clinical case:

1. Symptoms: The patient presents with neurological symptoms including unsteady gait, lower limb weakness, cognitive impairment, and spasticity. These are consistent with a disorder affecting the central nervous system, particularly the spinal cord.

2. Dietary trigger: The symptoms began after a 15-day vegetarian diet, suggesting a potential nutritional deficiency, particularly related to vitamin B12 (cobalamin).

3. Laboratory findings:
   - Elevated homocysteine level (8.85 mg/L; reference, <2.03 mg/L)
   - Methylmalonic acidemia detected in urine organic acid analysis
   - Normal B12 levels

4. Imaging: MRI showed a hyperintense T2-weighted signal in the cervical spinal cord, which is consistent with a metabolic disorder affecting the spinal cord.

5. Normal B12 levels: Despite the symptoms suggesting B12 deficiency, the patient's B12 levels were normal. This points to a problem with B12 metabolism rather than a simple deficiency.

Cobalamin G deficiency (also known as methionine synthase deficiency) is a disorder of intracellular cobalamin metabolism. It leads to functional B12 deficiency despite normal serum B12 levels. This condition results in elevated homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, which matches the patient's laboratory findings.

The combination of neurological symptoms, elevated homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, normal B12 levels, and the spinal cord changes on MRI are most consistent with Cobalamin G deficiency. This disorder can present with a wide range of neurological symptoms, including those observed in this patient.

While other options like hereditary spastic paraplegia or cystathionine β-synthase deficiency might explain some aspects of the case, they don't fully account for all the clinical and laboratory findings, particularly the methylmalonic acidemia.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

His medical and family histories were unremarkable. His walking had become unsteady, and he was less talkative. On examination, he scored 24 on a Mini-Mental State Examination, with impairments in temporal and spatial orientation, calculation, and short-term memory. Horizontal nystagmus was observed. His lower limb strength was 4 of 5 proximally and 5− of 5 distally, with increased muscle tone. Patellar reflexes were brisk. Ankle clonus and Babinski signs were present bilaterally. His gait was spastic (Video). Blood test results indicated normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 126 g/L; reference, >130 g/L [to convert to grams per deciliter, multiply by 0.1]), borderline folate elevation (2.15 ng/mL; reference, >2 μg/L [to convert nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.266]), and an increased homocysteine level (8.85 mg/L; reference, <2.03 mg/L [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 7.397]). Results of stool analysis; liver and kidney function tests; myocardial enzyme, electrolyte, ammonia, trace element, and B12 levels; thyroid function, arterial blood gas, antinuclear antibodies, and intrinsic factor antibody tests; and an infection panel test were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild cerebral atrophy and a hyperintense T2-weighted signal in the cervical spinal cord. Electromyography results were normal. Electroencephalography showed diffuse background slowing with scattered epileptiform discharges. Urine organic acid analysis indicated methylmalonic acidemia. A serum amino acid analysis was nondiagnostic (Figure 1). Cerebrospinal fluid was normal.Urine organic acid analysis using the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry method revealed increased methylmalonic acid levels in the patient sample (A) vs a normal control (B). cps indicates counts per second.

</options>",6.67037034034729,"content=""A\n\n[Explanation]\nThe most likely diagnosis for this 13-year-old boy is Cobalamin G or methionine synthase deficiency. This conclusion is based on several key factors from the clinical case:\n\n1. Symptoms: The patient presents with neurological symptoms including unsteady gait, lower limb weakness, cognitive impairment, and spasticity. These are consistent with a disorder affecting the central nervous system, particularly the spinal cord.\n\n2. Dietary trigger: The symptoms began after a 15-day vegetarian diet, suggesting a potential nutritional deficiency, particularly related to vitamin B12 (cobalamin).\n\n3. Laboratory findings:\n   - Elevated homocysteine level (8.85 mg/L; reference, <2.03 mg/L)\n   - Methylmalonic acidemia detected in urine organic acid analysis\n   - Normal B12 levels\n\n4. Imaging: MRI showed a hyperintense T2-weighted signal in the cervical spinal cord, which is consistent with a metabolic disorder affecting the spinal cord.\n\n5. Normal B12 levels: Despite the symptoms suggesting B12 deficiency, the patient's B12 levels were normal. This points to a problem with B12 metabolism rather than a simple deficiency.\n\nCobalamin G deficiency (also known as methionine synthase deficiency) is a disorder of intracellular cobalamin metabolism. It leads to functional B12 deficiency despite normal serum B12 levels. This condition results in elevated homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, which matches the patient's laboratory findings.\n\nThe combination of neurological symptoms, elevated homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, normal B12 levels, and the spinal cord changes on MRI are most consistent with Cobalamin G deficiency. This disorder can present with a wide range of neurological symptoms, including those observed in this patient.\n\nWhile other options like hereditary spastic paraplegia or cystathionine β-synthase deficiency might explain some aspects of the case, they don't fully account for all the clinical and laboratory findings, particularly the methylmalonic acidemia."" response_metadata={'id': 'msg_vrtx_01CrN3PcBLq1DMBgTYPELFzh', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 848, 'output_tokens': 483}} id='run-9bbb7e1c-30a1-47d0-9187-476a1b6e8a2a-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 848, 'output_tokens': 483, 'total_tokens': 1331}",0.0

Because the optic nerve may have variable degrees of temporal pallor in cone dystrophy, cone disorders should be included in the differential diagnosis. Optic atrophy is usually accompanied by CACNA1F congenital stationary night blindness,1 or it can be a late manifestation of retinitis pigmentosa. However, patients with congenital stationary night blindness typically have normal fundus and negative ERGs in scotopic response. Spinocerebellar ataxia and SSBP1 variant also cause OA and variable retinal degeneration.2,3Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed and revealed novel compound heterozygous NBAS c.3493del:p.(Val1165Serfs*31) c.5740C>T:p.(Arg1914Cys) variants. The 2 variants were in-trans, confirmed by trio WES, and are likely pathogenic.4 Results of further workups, including peripheral blood smear examination, showed bilobulated granulocytes (Figure 2) and hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG, 524.4 mg/dL [normal range, 800-1800 mg/dL]; IgA, 19.0 mg/dL [normal range, 105-500 mg/dL]; to convert IgG and IgA to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10); however, liver enzyme levels were normal.Peripheral blood smear shows bilobulated granulocytes, referred to as Pelger-Huët anomaly.The NBAS gene encodes a component protein of the syntaxin 18 complex and is involved in Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum transport.5﻿ NBAS gene mutations cause either infantile liver failure syndrome (OMIM 616483) or short stature, OA, Pelger-Huët anomaly (SOPH) syndrome (OMIM 614800) depending on the location of the variants.6 The NBAS gene has 3 functional domains as follows: beta-propeller domain and Sec39 domain, plus an unknown function of the C-terminal. The novel C-terminal variant discovered in the patient is the same amino acid residue p.(Arg1914His) known to be a founder mutation in the Yakut population.7 To our knowledge, hepatic dysfunction has never been reported in patients carrying the homozygous p.(Arg1914His) variant,7 but variable hepatic involvements have been observed in patients with compound heterozygous NBAS variants.8 A SOPH syndrome diagnosis is based on the clinical constellation of short stature, senile facial appearance, OA, Pelger-Huët anomaly, and normal intelligence.The key feature in this case is the extreme short stature, progeroid appearance, and cone dystrophy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (choice A) was deferred because the patient had no neurologic signs or symptoms. Wolfram syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Although growth hormone deficiency has been reported in Wolfram syndrome, checking the blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels (choice B) are inappropriate given the absence of diabetes and hearing impairment at his age.9 Moreover, visual acuity in Wolfram syndrome is typically worse then 20/200. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 also causes variable degrees of cone dystrophy and OA,3 but trinucleotide repeat sequencing (choice C) was deferred because the patient had no ataxia. Therefore, WES is the most appropriate next step.The ophthalmologic manifestation of SOPH syndrome is characterized by OA and color vision loss. Other ophthalmologic manifestations, including horizontal nystagmus, retinal dystrophy, foveal hypoplasia, gray sclera, and corneal opacity, were also reported.7,8,10 Vision loss and OA can be initial manifestations in SOPH syndrome. Recognition of syndromic features and a high index of suspicion can identify the underlying causes of OA. In addition, the NBAS gene should be included in the targeted workup for both OA and cone dystrophy.During the 5 years of follow-up, the patient’s visual acuity was maintained.

[Explanation]
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) is the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient presents with a complex clinical picture that suggests a genetic disorder:

1. Reduced visual acuity since childhood
2. Short stature (-3.6 SD)
3. Progeroid appearance
4. Optic atrophy and retinal changes
5. Abnormal ERG results
6. No family history of similar conditions

The combination of optic atrophy, cone dysfunction (as evidenced by the ERG results and color vision deficiency), short stature, and progeroid appearance points towards a rare genetic syndrome. Common causes of optic atrophy, such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, have already been ruled out.

Whole-exome sequencing is a comprehensive genetic test that can identify mutations in a wide range of genes, including those associated with rare syndromes. It is particularly useful in cases where the clinical presentation is complex and doesn't fit a single, well-defined genetic disorder.

The other options are less appropriate:

B. Checking blood glucose and HbA1c is not indicated as there are no symptoms suggestive of diabetes.

C. Trinucleotide repeat sequencing for spinocerebellar ataxia is not warranted as the patient doesn't show neurological symptoms typical of this condition.

D. Brain MRI might be considered later, but it's not the most informative next step given the likely genetic etiology of the condition.

Whole-exome sequencing offers the best chance of identifying the underlying genetic cause of this patient's complex presentation, which could lead to a definitive diagnosis and inform genetic counseling and management.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

However, these microbiology studies were obtained while the patient was receiving broad-spectrum topical antibiotic therapy. Initial culture results were obtained from the referring physician (choice A), which grew Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The patient then disclosed that his partner recently had a penile ulcer. He was immediately treated with saline lavages and single doses of intramuscular ceftriaxone sodium, 1 g, and oral azithromycin, 1 g, for gonococcal keratoconjunctivitis.Although this patient was initially transferred with concern for a traumatic ruptured globe, the history of prior tree trauma was a red herring. The persistent purulence and corneal stromal necrosis raised concern for infection. Yield of ocular surface cultures are decreased when samples are obtained with concurrent topical antimicrobial therapy.1 This case also emphasizes the potential importance of follow-up on primary data. When patients are transferred between institutions with different medical record systems, information can be lost. Serologic workup for autoimmune keratitis (choice B) is not the preferred answer because the hyperpurulence and beefy conjunctival injection would be atypical for this sterile inflammatory presentation. Starting empirical treatment for acanthamoeba (choice C) is incorrect because hyperpurulence is unusual in acanthamoeba keratitis, and the patient had no freshwater risk factors or history of contact lens wear. With progressive corneal necrosis, returning to the operating room for therapeutic keratoplasty (choice D) may have been required; however, the initial best step in management is to obtain confirmative diagnosis.Gonorrheal keratoconjunctivitis is due to infection with N gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative diplococcus. In populations other than neonates, transmission mostly occurs via direct sexual contact with infective secretions or indirectly via fomite transmission.2 A study in Ireland found the prevalence of gonococcal conjunctivitis to be 0.19 cases per 1000 patients evaluated for eye emergencies, with the majority in young adult males.3Treatment of gonorrheal keratoconjunctivitis is both systemic and local. Recommended systemic treatment includes administration of intramuscular ceftriaxone, 1 g, in a single dose.4,5 Systemic azithromycin, 1 g, in a single dose or oral doxycycline, 100 mg twice a day for 7 days, is also added owing to frequent coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis.6 Topical treatment is ancillary and can include a fluoroquinolone, macrolide, and/or saline lavages.3,7 Gonorrhea is a reportable disease. Notification of risk of this disease and treatment of all sexual partners is necessary.Gonococcal keratoconjunctivitis may lead to serious ocular complications. Corneal stromal necrosis can occur, as with this case, in a fulminant fashion. Treatment of corneal stromal necrosis depends on the size and extent of stromal involvement and whether perforation of the cornea is present. Medical management of corneal stromal necrosis includes systemic antigonorrheal antibiotic therapy and anticollagenase medications. Surgical management for descemetoceles and perforations may include glue, amniotic membrane transplant, therapeutic lamellar, or full-thickness corneal and conjunctival flaps. In this case, corneal gluing was pursued because the area of perforation was small.The diagnosis of gonococcal keratoconjunctivitis should be considered in individuals who present with markedly purulent conjunctivitis with or without genital symptoms. History may not be forthcoming. Presentation classically includes conjunctival injection, eyelid edema, hyperpurulent discharge, and preauricular lymphadenopathy. With prompt, effective treatment, the infection can be eradicated and complications, such as corneal melt and perforation, can be avoided.After treatment with intramuscular ceftriaxone, 1 g, oral azithromycin, 1 g, gentle saline lavage, and topical moxifloxacin, 0.5% four times a day, this patient’s anterior chamber reformed, the corneal epithelial defect decreased in size, and iris structures were visible owing to improvement in the corneal infiltrate.

[Explanation]
In this complex case of a 65-year-old HIV-positive man with severe eye infection following trauma, obtaining the initial culture results from the referring physician is the most appropriate next step.

The patient's condition has worsened despite broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, including topical and systemic antibiotics. The fact that all subsequent microbiology cultures were negative is concerning, as it suggests that the initial empiric treatment may not have been targeting the correct pathogen.

Given the patient's immunocompromised status (CD4 count of 112 cells/mm3) and the history of trauma from a tree branch, there's a high risk of opportunistic or atypical infections. The initial cultures taken at the outside hospital could provide crucial information about the causative organism, which might be resistant to the current treatment or require a different approach altogether.

Obtaining these results before proceeding with more invasive procedures (like therapeutic keratoplasty) or initiating treatment for other potential causes (like acanthamoeba) is essential for guiding appropriate therapy. It could reveal an unusual or resistant pathogen that requires specific targeted treatment.

While therapeutic keratoplasty might eventually be necessary given the corneal perforation and ongoing necrosis, it's premature without first understanding the underlying infection. Similarly, empirical treatment for acanthamoeba or pursuing an autoimmune workup should not be prioritized before reviewing the initial culture results.

In summary, obtaining the initial culture results is the most logical next step to guide further management and potentially avoid unnecessary procedures or treatments.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder associated with Sjögren syndrome,C,Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder associated with Sjögren syndrome,"The initial clinical suspicion for GCA was high given the patient’s classic presentation—a woman older than 65 years with sequential bilateral vision loss accompanied by scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, weight loss, and musculoskeletal pain suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica. Expedited evaluation and treatment are critical in suspected GCA. Initial laboratory workup should include ESR, CRP, and platelet count tests. Chan et al1 found that these 3 tests have similar sensitivity (range, 65%-71%) and specificity (range, 57%-62%) for GCA. The gold standard of GCA diagnosis is TAB, but the sensitivity is only 77%.2 Empirical treatment should not be delayed for TAB because the positivity rate is similar after up to 4 weeks of systemic corticosteroid therapy.3 In this clinically suspicious patient with ESR elevation but normal CRP level and platelet count and negative TAB results, GCA remained a plausible diagnosis to justify continued corticosteroid therapy.Vision loss secondary to arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is generally substantial and irreversible despite corticosteroid therapy,4 and treatment aims to reduce visual morbidity rather than restore vision. Accordingly, this patient underwent empirical treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy with the intent to preserve the remaining right eye vision.This patient’s improvement in vision was unexpected and challenged the working diagnosis of GCA (choice B). The patient also lacked the chalky optic nerve edema classically seen in GCA. On the contrary, this patient appeared to have a corticosteroid-responsive optic neuritis. A differential diagnosis might include demyelinating disease (eg, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease [MOGAD]) and inflammatory processes (eg, neurosarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome [SS]). Investigation for alternative diagnoses was pursued. The evidence of dry-eye disease on examination and incidental bilateral parotid gland cysts on neuroimaging suggested underlying SS. Of note, parotid cysts are not specific to SS and can also be seen in benign lymphoepithelial lesions (as occur in HIV infection), sarcoidosis, Warthin tumor, and obstructive sialadenitis.5 Serologic test results were positive for anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La, and anti–aquaporin 4 antibodies. The patient subsequently underwent cervical and thoracic spine magnetic resonance imaging, which showed contiguous signal abnormality in the spinal cord from T1 to T3 (Figure 2). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) associated with SS (choice C). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti–aquaporin 4 antibody (as used in this patient) has 97% specificity for NMOSD, and serum cell-based assays have up to 99% specificity.6 Bilateral non–arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (choice A) would be unlikely in this patient who lacked the disc-at-risk configuration—crowded small nerve head with small cup-disc ratio.7T2-weighted sagittal magnetic resonance image shows increased signal (arrowhead) from T1 to T3. No corresponding contrast enhancement was appreciated. These findings are compatible with a prior demyelinating lesion from neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder may occur in association with other autoimmune diseases. Co-occurrence with SS has been described, and in patients with this co-occurrence, onset of NMOSD may precede sicca symptoms.8 Other autoimmune disorders associated with NMOSD include systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, systemic sclerosis, and sarcoidosis.8 A causal association unifying comorbid autoimmune disease and NMOSD has not been established, and it is unknown if the association is better explained by genetic tendency toward autoimmunity.8 In contrast, co-occurring autoimmune disease is rare with MOGAD (choice D)9; indeed, serological testing for MOGAD was negative in this case.Initial therapy for acute episodes of NMOSD is intravenous corticosteroids. Refractory episodes may be treated with plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin.8,10 Long-term therapy uses immunosuppression. First-line immunosuppressive agents include azathioprine, rituximab, and mycophenolate mofetil. Second-line agents include methotrexate, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide.10The patient was treated with immunosuppressive therapy (initially methotrexate sodium and later mycophenolate mofetil) with concurrent slow taper of oral prednisone.

[Explanation]
The diagnosis in this case is most likely Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) associated with Sjögren syndrome. This conclusion is based on several key factors:

1. Bilateral optic nerve involvement: The patient experienced sequential bilateral vision loss, which is characteristic of NMOSD.

2. MRI findings: The MRI showed abnormal signal and contrast enhancement within the intraorbital midportion of both optic nerves, which is consistent with NMOSD.

3. Negative temporal artery biopsy: Despite initial suspicion of giant cell arteritis (GCA), the temporal artery biopsy was negative, ruling out this diagnosis.

4. Response to steroid treatment: The patient's vision improved significantly after steroid treatment, which is often seen in NMOSD.

5. Associated autoimmune condition: The presence of parotid gland cysts on MRI suggests the possibility of Sjögren syndrome, an autoimmune condition that can be associated with NMOSD.

6. Age and gender: NMOSD is more common in women and can occur in older adults, fitting this patient's profile.

While the initial presentation with scalp tenderness and jaw claudication suggested GCA, the negative biopsy and normal CRP make this diagnosis less likely. The bilateral nature of the optic nerve involvement, along with the MRI findings and associated autoimmune features, strongly support the diagnosis of NMOSD associated with Sjögren syndrome.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Magnesium depletion,C,Magnesium depletion,"Magnesium and calcium replacement therapy were started immediately. Thiamine was also administered. Clinical evolution was favorable with progressive improvement of symptoms, normalization of metabolic parameters, and radiological resolution of the MRI abnormalities.The lack of family history and the speed of onset and advanced age suggested acquired ataxia. The recent history of arrhythmia and seizures indicated an extraneurological involvement, and the transient episodes of tetaniform rigidity suggested neuromuscular hyperexcitability. Notably, downbeat nystagmus can be caused by lesions at the craniocervical junction, diseases of the lower brainstem and cerebellum, or metabolic disturbances, including vitamin B1, vitamin B12, or magnesium deficiencies.1 Therefore, vitamin deficiencies and ionic alterations were considered as explanations for the cerebellar dysfunction and cardiac dysfunction.2 However, neuromuscular hyperexcitability with tetaniform rigidity made ionic disturbances the first diagnostic suspicion because of its association with metabolism of calcium and magnesium. The patient’s history of alcohol use could have been associated with toxic effects or vitamin deficiency–related ataxia, but alcohol intake had stopped more than 10 years earlier.The critically low serum magnesium levels explained the progressive mental disorder and cerebellar ataxia, downbeat nystagmus, transient episodes of tetaniform rigidity, seizures, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and general syndrome. The exclusion of other plausible etiologies and the regression of clinical and radiological alterations after magnesium replacement therapy support the diagnosis of reversible cerebellar ataxia associated with hypomagnesemia.This patient was taking 2 drugs that can lower magnesium levels: a PPI and a loop diuretic. The use of PPIs impairs absorption of magnesium by intestinal epithelial cells.3 The concomitant use of PPIs and diuretics further increases the risk of hypomagnesemia. PPIs were immediately suspended after hypomagnesemia detection.Hypomagnesemia has been detected in up to 12% of hospitalized patients, and in 60% of patients in the intensive care unit setting.4 Its clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to life-threatening arrhythmias, and can include neurological symptoms, hypertension, hipocalcemia, and hypokalemia.5 Early neurological disturbances include neuropsychiatric problems and neuromuscular hyperexcitability with Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign, tremors, fasciculations, and tetany. It can also cause headaches, seizures, fatigue, and malaise.5Vertical nystagmus is a rare but diagnostically useful sign of severe hypomagnesemia. In the absence of a structural lesion of the cerebellar and vestibular pathways, the only other recognized metabolic etiology is Wernicke encephalopathy.1 However, there was no malnourishment, active alcohol use, or evidence of other predisposing conditions associated with Wernicke encephalopathy, and MRI findings were not typical. The lack of a prompt response to intravenous thiamine administration also countered this diagnosis, although the response to thiamine may be less evident in the presence of hypomagnesemia.6Hypomagnesemia associated with ataxia and reversible cerebellar hyperintensities has been described on a few occasions.7 The typical neuroradiological pattern of hypomagnesemia is characterized by cerebellar hyperintense lesions involving the cerebellar vermis. Lesions restricted to cerebellar nodulus are extremely rare. Isolated nodular infarctions are characterized by an abrupt onset of symptoms, typically isolated vestibular syndrome.8 The neuroimaging differs from the MRI presented in this patient because of the presence of characteristic diffusion restriction.8The pathogenesis of cerebellar dysfunction probably relates to the stabilizing role of magnesium on the vascular endothelium. Critically low magnesium levels mimic the vascular endothelial dysregulation seen in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome leading to cerebral edema of the posterior circulation territories.9Magnesium is not part of the routine electrolyte panel in most hospitals. Hypomagnesemia constitutes a rare and treatable cause of cerebellar ataxia, but one that needs to be specifically thought of. In such cases, early diagnosis and management are essential to avoid permanent cerebellar impairment.

[Explanation]

The most appropriate diagnosis for this case is magnesium depletion. This conclusion is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Symptoms: The patient presented with progressive unsteadiness, malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms are consistent with magnesium deficiency, which can affect multiple organ systems.

2. Neurological signs: The patient exhibited confusion, dysarthria, appendicular dysmetria with truncal ataxia, and downbeat nystagmus. These cerebellar and neurological symptoms are known manifestations of severe hypomagnesemia.

3. Laboratory findings: The most significant finding is the severely low serum magnesium level of 0.3 mg/dL (normal range: 1.8-2.5 mg/dL). This profound hypomagnesemia is the key diagnostic indicator.

4. Associated electrolyte abnormalities: The patient also had hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, which often accompany magnesium depletion due to the interrelated metabolism of these electrolytes.

5. MRI findings: The brain MRI showed hyperintensity in the cerebellar nodule, which resolved after magnesium replacement (as mentioned in the figure description).

6. Exclusion of other causes: The extensive workup, including tests for various antibodies, onconeural markers, and other potential causes of cerebellar dysfunction, were negative.

7. Risk factors: The patient's history of alcohol use, although stopped 10 years prior, and the use of proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole) are known risk factors for magnesium depletion.

The resolution of MRI findings after magnesium replacement strongly supports this diagnosis. While the patient had a history of alcohol use, the long period of abstinence makes toxic cerebellar degeneration less likely. The negative antibody tests and imaging studies rule out paraneoplastic cerebellar disease. Thiamine deficiency, while a possibility in patients with a history of alcohol use, does not fully explain the severe hypomagnesemia and associated electrolyte abnormalities.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

This conclusion is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:\n\n1. Symptoms: The patient presented with progressive unsteadiness, malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms are consistent with magnesium deficiency, which can affect multiple organ systems.\n\n2. Neurological signs: The patient exhibited confusion, dysarthria, appendicular dysmetria with truncal ataxia, and downbeat nystagmus. These cerebellar and neurological symptoms are known manifestations of severe hypomagnesemia.\n\n3. Laboratory findings: The most significant finding is the severely low serum magnesium level of 0.3 mg/dL (normal range: 1.8-2.5 mg/dL). This profound hypomagnesemia is the key diagnostic indicator.\n\n4. Associated electrolyte abnormalities: The patient also had hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, which often accompany magnesium depletion due to the interrelated metabolism of these electrolytes.\n\n5. MRI findings: The brain MRI showed hyperintensity in the cerebellar nodule, which resolved after magnesium replacement (as mentioned in the figure description).\n\n6. Exclusion of other causes: The extensive workup, including tests for various antibodies, onconeural markers, and other potential causes of cerebellar dysfunction, were negative.\n\n7. Risk factors: The patient's history of alcohol use, although stopped 10 years prior, and the use of proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole) are known risk factors for magnesium depletion.\n\nThe resolution of MRI findings after magnesium replacement strongly supports this diagnosis. While the patient had a history of alcohol use, the long period of abstinence makes toxic cerebellar degeneration less likely. The negative antibody tests and imaging studies rule out paraneoplastic cerebellar disease. Thiamine deficiency, while a possibility in patients with a history of alcohol use, does not fully explain the severe hypomagnesemia and associated electrolyte abnormalities."" response_metadata={'id': 'msg_vrtx_01BRuMjoiNgGSDUt4aMjYhYy', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 1241, 'output_tokens': 483}} id='run-34431cea-f8e3-40fb-8237-2e63b29fabd6-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1241, 'output_tokens': 483, 'total_tokens': 1724}",1.0

It is characterized by progressive vision loss along with electroretinographic, visual field abnormalities, and the presence of circulating ARAs. Autoimmune retinopathy can be categorized as paraneoplastic (pAIR), which includes cancer-associated retinopathy and melanoma-associated retinopathy, or nonparaneoplastic in the absence of a malignant neoplasm.1,2Diagnosis remains a challenge because of its variable presentation and fundus appearance, which may be initially normal or with minimal unrevealing alterations despite central vision loss and a severely decreased visual field.1,2 Moreover, in contrast with previous reported cases,3,4 the patient did not show any systemic symptoms that would have been helpful toward the diagnosis.A differential diagnosis might include heritable retinal degenerations, because clinical findings in AIR, including peripheral visual field loss, reduced electroretinogram waveforms, retinal pigmented epithelium atrophic changes, pigment migration, and photoreceptor loss on optical coherence tomography, can be suggestive of heritable diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa.5 In this case, molecular analysis for heritable retinal degenerations (choice B) would not have been the preferred next step because the patient had no family history of inherited ocular diseases and did not experience typical symptoms, such as nyctalopia, photophobia, or dyschromatopsia. Furthermore, the relatively rapid progression of photoreceptor loss was not typical for retinitis pigmentosa and no bone spicule-like pigmentary changes were present during the fundus examination.The presence of circulating ARAs is important in the pathophysiology and diagnosis of AIR, although it is not pathognomonic, as they have been identified in other retinal diseases, such as uveitis,6 in patients with systemic autoimmune disorders,7 and in healthy controls.8 Given the absence of standardized diagnostic criteria, it has been proposed that an AIR diagnosis should require serum positivity for ARAs associated with progressive loss of visual acuity, visual field defects, and abnormal responses on electroretinography, in the absence of fundus lesions or degenerative retinal disease that might explain these pathologic findings.1,2Therefore, given the clinical features found in the patient, investigating the presence of ARAs (choice C) was considered to be the most suitable next step to confirm the diagnostic suspicion of AIR. Furthermore, because serum positivity for ARAs and visual symptoms may be present many years before detecting malignant neoplasms in patients with pAIR,9,10 an oncologic workup was deemed appropriate for clarifying the paraneoplastic nature of the AIR.Obtaining a diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous and aqueous sampling for cytologic analysis (choice D) would not have provided useful information for definitively clarifying the diagnosis and would not have guided us toward the detection of malignant neoplasms.Obtaining a temporal artery biopsy specimen because of suspicion of Horton disease (choice A) would not have been the proper management option. In fact, the patient did not experience typical symptoms, such as headache, jaw claudication, sensitivity on the scalp, or prominent temporal arteries.The patient underwent antiretinal antibody testing that demonstrated reactivity to multiple ARAs. She was referred to the oncology department to undergo a systemic workup for malignant neoplasms and was found to be affected by stage IV, poorly differentiated, gastric adenocarcinoma with multiple metastasis to the abdominal and supraclavicular lymph nodes. She started palliative chemotherapy with FLOT regimen (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel).

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to investigate serum positivity for antiretinal antibodies and obtain an extensive workup to rule out a malignant neoplasm.

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a possible autoimmune retinopathy, which can be associated with underlying malignancies (paraneoplastic syndrome). Several factors support this decision:

1. Age and onset: The patient is 65 years old with a relatively rapid onset of bilateral vision loss over 6 months, which is atypical for hereditary retinal degenerations but consistent with autoimmune retinopathy.

2. Lack of family history: The patient denies any family history of inherited ocular diseases, making a genetic cause less likely.

3. Clinical findings: The fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and OCT findings are consistent with retinal degeneration, which can be seen in autoimmune retinopathy.

4. Electroretinography results: Decreased scotopic and photopic responses support diffuse retinal dysfunction, which is characteristic of autoimmune retinopathy.

5. Negative initial workup: The extensive workup for infectious or inflammatory causes was unrevealing, necessitating further investigation into less common etiologies.

Investigating for antiretinal antibodies is crucial in diagnosing autoimmune retinopathy, and a comprehensive workup to rule out malignancy is essential, as some cases of autoimmune retinopathy are paraneoplastic. This approach will help identify any underlying systemic condition that may be causing the retinal degeneration and guide appropriate treatment.

The other options are less appropriate:
- Option A (vitrectomy) is too invasive at this stage and unlikely to provide diagnostic information.
- Option C (genetic testing) is less likely given the patient's age and lack of family history.
- Option D (temporal artery biopsy) is not indicated as the patient's presentation is not typical for giant cell arteritis (Horton's disease).","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

What Would You Do Next?",Forced duction testing,Magnetic resonance imaging,Reversed fixation test,Genetic testing,Dissociated horizontal deviation,C,Reversed fixation test,"The term dissociated horizontal deviation (DHD) was originally used to describe a unique form of intermittent exotropia in which the measured exodeviation was larger with 1 eye fixating than the other.1-4 In some cases, the exodeviation resolves or converts to a large esodeviation when the patient fixates with the nonpreferred eye. Associated clinical findings include latent nystagmus, dissociated vertical divergence, and sensorial suppression of the nonfixating eye, indicating that DHD develops only when binocular visual input is preempted early in life.3-6 Some cases arise spontaneously, but most patients have undergone previous bimedial recessions.5Originally attributed to unequal convergence damping of latent nystagmus,1,2 it is now clear that this variable exodeviation is driven by a change in the sensory balance of visual inputs from both eyes.7 In patients with DHD, monocular fixation induces a dissociated esodeviation (greater during fixation with the nonpreferred eye) that is usually superimposed on an exotropic resting position of the eyes (as found under nondepolarizing general anesthesia). Thus, when the baseline vergence position of the eyes is orthotropic, DHD can generate an esodeviation of variable amplitude in both eyes. Gräf et al8 described this phenomenon in a patient who presented with unilateral accommodative esotropia. This patient’s eyes were aligned when examined under nondepolarizing anesthesia (Figure 2), confirming that DHD must arise from excessive esotonus during conditions of monocular fixation. The oscillopsia resulted from her latent nystagmus, which manifested during periods of intense fixation and esodeviation.Clinical photograph of the patient’s eyes while she was under nondepolarizing paralyzing anesthesia shows the orthotropic position of the eyes under conditions of noninnervation.The initial confirmatory test for DHD is the reversed fixation test (choice C).9 After measuring the horizontal deviation in the nonfixating eye using alternate cover testing, the occluder is shifted back to the nonfixating eye, which normally shows no movement because the horizontal deviation has already been neutralized by the prism. In DHD, however, a horizontal movement of the fixating eye is seen, showing the presence of fixation-dependent innervation.9,10The differential diagnosis of intermittent esotropia in adulthood includes decompensating esotropia (often caused by early presbyopia, necessitating excessive accommodative effort), anisometropia, and DHD. Retinoscopy ruled out anisometropia. An esodeviation produced by excessive accommodative effort owing to early presbyopia would be symmetrical in both eyes. Forced duction testing (choice A) was not indicated as ocular rotations were full. The absence of diplopia and the presence of latent nystagmus showed that this esotropia arose from a long-standing strabismus rather than a new-onset neurologic condition. Magnetic resonance imaging (choice B) was therefore not warranted. An increase in the exodeviation during periods of inattention (ie, nonfixation) is a useful clinical clue to the diagnosis of DHD.10 In this patient, resolution of the esodeviation (due to suspension of dissociated esotonus) was seen during periods of nonfixation. Genetic testing (choice D) was not indicated as infantile strabismus is rarely hereditary, and she had no family history of strabismus.The patient was treated with small bilateral lateral rectus resections, which produced a consecutive exotropia.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to perform a reversed fixation test. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Intermittent esotropia: The patient presents with intermittent inward turning of the eyes, particularly the right eye.

2. Asymmetry in deviation: There's a notable difference in the degree of esotropia when fixing with the left eye versus the right eye, as shown in the insets of Figure 1.

3. Dissociated vertical divergence (DVD): This is observed when the patient is fixing with her preferred left eye.

4. History of strabismus surgery: The patient had previous surgery for crossed eyes as a child.

The reversed fixation test is particularly useful in cases of asymmetric strabismus and when there's a suspicion of a primary versus secondary deviation. This test helps differentiate between primary and secondary deviations by comparing the magnitude of deviation when each eye fixates.

In this case, the test would involve:
1. Measuring the deviation with the patient fixing with her preferred left eye.
2. Then measuring the deviation while the patient fixes with her non-preferred right eye.

This test can help determine if the larger left esotropia observed during right eye fixation is due to a primary deviation or if it's a larger secondary deviation. This information is crucial for surgical planning if intervention is deemed necessary.

The other options are less appropriate:
A. Genetic testing is not indicated as there's no family history of strabismus.
B. Forced duction testing is typically used to assess mechanical restrictions, which are not the primary concern here.
C. MRI is not necessary as there are no neurological symptoms or signs suggesting intracranial pathology.

Therefore, the reversed fixation test (D) is the most appropriate next step in evaluating this complex case of intermittent esotropia with asymmetric deviation.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Primary localized conjunctival amyloidosis is a rare but well-described entity, most frequently affecting the palpebral conjunctiva and superior fornix.1 The diagnosis of amyloidosis is based on its characteristic histologic features that help differentiate it from other conditions, such as malignant neoplasms (lymphoma, squamous, or sebaceous cell carcinomas) and inflammatory disorders (pyogenic granuloma, sarcoidosis). Clinically, it is most easily distinguished from a more defined, pedunculated, and highly vascular pyogenic granuloma. Amyloid characteristically stains with Congo red and exhibits apple-green birefringence on polarization microscopy examination (Figure 2). Therefore, an incisional biopsy should be performed (choice D) for diagnostic purposes. This can also provide symptomatic relief by debulking the conjunctival mass with an estimated recurrence rate of less than 30%.1 A complete excisional biopsy (choice B) may be performed for solitary or more confined lesions, but it is less suitable for diffuse involvement of the conjunctiva as in this case.1,2 Unlike inflammatory conditions, localized conjunctival amyloidosis does not respond to corticosteroid therapy (choice A). Lubricants can provide temporary symptomatic relief; however, surgical debulking remains the mainstay of therapy. If orbital amyloidosis causes substantial ptosis, proptosis, or eye movement restrictions, further surgical intervention and targeted external beam radiotherapy may be considered.3,4Amyloid deposits in the conjunctival stroma staining with Congo red (original magnification ×100) and exhibiting apple-green birefringence under polarized light (original magnification ×200; inset).Histologic examination confirmed conjunctival amyloidosis of no specific subtype in this patient. More than 20 different types of amyloid protein have been described. Secondary amyloidosis occurs in the context of systemic conditions, leading to the accumulation of AA amyloid derived from the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A. In primary amyloidosis, immunoglobulin light-chain–derived protein (AL) deposits in tissues. The condition may be localized or associated with an underlying plasma cell disorder. In a small proportion of patients, systemic AL amyloidosis may eventually progress to multiple myeloma,5 whereas systemic AL amyloidosis may subsequently develop in approximately 1% of patients with multiple myeloma; this development confers a poor prognosis.6Conjunctival amyloidosis is usually primary and localized, with no systemic associations.1,4 However, a basic examination to rule out systemic disease is recommended.1 Investigations typically include a complete blood cell count, bone profile, kidney and liver function tests, urinalysis, and serum and urine electrophoresis.1 Presence of monoclonal gammopathy warrants further hematologic assessment by performing a bone marrow biopsy to exclude underlying multiple myeloma and other blood dyscrasias. Finally, ordering imaging of the orbits is useful to determine the extent of the condition, including any orbital involvement.2,4Performing the incisional biopsy sufficiently debulked the lesion to alleviate the patient’s ocular symptoms. At the 6-month follow-up, the conjunctival appearance remained stable. Systemic examination findings, including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits, bone marrow aspirate, and transthoracic echocardiogram, were unremarkable. Despite an elevated IgM level, no underlying plasma cell dyscrasia was identified. The patient continues to receive regular examinations from the oculoplastics service and has been referred to the National Amyloidosis Center.",Ophthalmology,2021-04-01,2021,4,"A 73-year-old man was referred to our service for assessment of a slow-growing conjunctival lesion in the left eye.

[Explanation]
In this case, an incisional biopsy of the lesion (option B) is the most appropriate next step. Here's why:

1. Presentation: The patient has a slow-growing conjunctival lesion with distinctive characteristics (yellow-pink polypoidal papules, velvety yellow appearance) that has been present for 3 months.

2. Abnormal serum findings: The patient has raised monoclonal IgM bands and an abnormal κ/λ light-chain ratio, suggesting a possible underlying hematological disorder.

3. Diagnostic necessity: Given the unusual appearance of the lesion and the abnormal serum findings, a tissue diagnosis is crucial to determine the nature of the lesion and guide further management.

4. Biopsy type: An incisional biopsy is preferred over a complete excisional biopsy (option A) because:
   a) The lesion is diffuse and involves both the inferior and superior palpebral conjunctiva, making complete excision challenging and potentially harmful.
   b) An incisional biopsy can provide sufficient tissue for diagnosis while being less invasive.

5. Other options:
   - MRI (option C) might be considered later but is not the immediate next step without a tissue diagnosis.
   - Lubricating drops and topical corticosteroids (option D) would be symptomatic treatment without addressing the underlying cause.

An incisional biopsy will provide the necessary histopathological information to guide further management, which may include systemic workup for lymphoproliferative disorders or other hematological conditions, given the abnormal serum findings.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

The patient was born in Canada and was small for gestational age, but had no apparent visual, auditory, or cardiac issues at birth. In early adulthood, when joining the military, the patient was tested and informed of her serologic rubella immunity. This patient’s presentation with early-onset hearing loss, granular retinal pigmentary mottling with punctate hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation (“salt and pepper”), and irregularly distributed speckled fundus autofluorescence changes is consistent with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).Although the patient used pentosan polysulfate, her cumulative exposure was relatively low; in a series of 35 cases of pentosan polysulfate maculopathy, the median (range) cumulative exposure was 1.61 kg (0.44-4.32 kg).1 In addition, her pattern of fundus autofluorescence abnormality, with loosely spaced speckled hypoautofluorescence, did not resemble pentosan polysulfate maculopathy, which typically manifests a symmetric dense pattern of hypoautofluorescent and hyperautofluorescent spots centered on and involving the fovea (choice A).1,2 This case is not consistent with age-related macular degeneration (choice B) given the absence of drusen and the unique fundus autofluorescence abnormalities. She had no family history of macular disease, and her imaging results were not consistent with the classic phenotypes of pattern dystrophy (choice C), which encompass a variety of presentations typically featuring more prominent, discrete, and symmetric pigmentary changes centered on the fovea.Congenital rubella syndrome occurs by transplacental transmission of the rubella virus, initially described as a triad of neonatal deafness, cardiac anomalies, and cataracts.3,4 Most affected infants have no detected abnormality at birth, but nearly all eventually display variable multiorgan involvement (commonly auditory, ophthalmic, and endocrine) in early childhood owing to persistent viral replication.5 In a 20-year follow-up of 125 patients with CRS, ocular disease was most prevalent, affecting 78% of the patients, and, of these, 53% also had hearing loss.5 Retinopathy was the most common ophthalmic manifestation, although other reported findings included microphthalmia, glaucoma, corneal clouding, and strabismus.5,6 A potential complication of rubella retinopathy is choroidal neovascularization, which has been reported in numerous cases but without known incidence.6 Amsler grid testing may aid in early detection of choroidal neovascularization. However, Amsler grid testing has relatively poor sensitivity and specificity when used in patients with age-related macular degeneration, and it is unknown how effective it is in patients with rubella retinopathy.While the incidence of rubella has decreased since the introduction of vaccination programs in 1969, mothers pregnant prior to that introduction were potentially still exposed, and there are occasionally imported cases.7 Industrialized countries are experiencing more outbreaks given growing antivaccination movements.7,8 The incidence of rubella is approximately 1.3 of 100 000 population worldwide and 0 of 100 000 population in the US.9 From 2004 to 2012, there were 79 cases of primary rubella in the US and 6 cases of CRS, all from mothers who traveled in Africa during pregnancy.4,10 Congenital rubella syndrome will remain an important clinical challenge given its endemic nature in developing nations, globalization, and antivaccination trends.Notably, rubella retinopathy is a clinical diagnosis. Serologic immunity can occur with vaccination or after infection; therefore, proving a remote previous infection is challenging. However, proper diagnosis is important given the potential serious and multiorgan involvement.Results of the patient’s cardiac workup were normal. She was advised to discuss with her prescribing physician whether she should discontinue pentosan polysulfate given her potential heightened risk for pentosan polysulfate maculopathy in the setting of CRS retinopathy.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to inform the patient that she has changes from drug toxicity. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical case:

1. The patient has been taking pentosan polysulfate (Elmiron) for 4½ years, with a cumulative dose of 324 g. Pentosan polysulfate is known to cause maculopathy in some patients, especially with long-term use.

2. The fundus examination revealed mild retinal pigment epithelium mottling and scattered, deep punctate, hypopigmented lesions. These findings are consistent with pentosan polysulfate-associated maculopathy.

3. Optical coherence tomography showed trace irregularity to the outer retinal bands, which is also consistent with early pentosan polysulfate toxicity.

4. Fundus autofluorescence imaging demonstrated irregularly distributed speckled hypoautofluorescence in the posterior pole of each eye, a characteristic finding in pentosan polysulfate maculopathy.

5. The patient was specifically referred for pentosan polysulfate maculopathy screening, indicating a pre-existing concern about this potential complication.

In an analysis of approximately 12 000 patients referred to a tertiary care center with uveal melanoma over a 25-year period, 1739 (14%) proved to be pseudomelanoma.2 Of these, the most common pseudomelanomas included choroidal nevus (851 [49%]), peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorioretinopathy (139 [8%]), and congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium (108 [6%]).2 Much less commonly, compression by an orbital mass (3 [0.2%]) was noted, as in this case with compression by a radial scleral sponge.Several features in this case suggest that the intraocular mass represents compression by an external device, likely a radial sponge from the previous scleral buckle surgery. The chorioretinal atrophic scar over its apex suggests previous cryotherapy, and the abrupt echodense appearance with shadowing on ultrasonography suggests a foreign body, such as an indentation sponge. Thus, choice D is correct, as a suspected correlation to previous retinal surgery would be revealing. These features suggest a radial sponge presenting as pseudomelanoma; therefore, performing a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (choice A) or applying radioactive iodine I 125 plaque radiotherapy (choice B) would not be necessary. Ordering magnetic resonance imaging (choice C) could be helpful if the medical records denied a scleral buckle, as this would document a nonenhancing mass external to the globe, unlike melanoma, which generally shows gadolinium enhancement within the globe.Scleral buckle can closely simulate choroidal melanoma clinically, but it can be differentiated by buckle features showing lack of flow on fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography, echodensity with shadowing on ultrasonography, and lack of gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging. The hydrogel variant of scleral buckle can even more closely resemble choroidal melanoma because it slowly swells over time, demonstrating pseudoenlargement.3 Some intraocular tumors exhibit echodensity on ultrasonography, including choroidal nevus, metastasis, osteoma, scleritis, sclerochoroidal calcification, retinoblastoma, and retinal astrocytic hamartoma.Despite the benign nature of the scleral buckle in this case, the clinician should recognize that choroidal melanoma can occur overlying scleral buckle, and the differentiation can be challenging.4 In this patient, observation was advised, and the radial sponge remained.The patient was reassured as to the benign nature of this lesion and observation was provided.",Ophthalmology,2021-03-01,2021,3,"An 89-year-old asymptomatic woman presented to a new eye care professional for a routine examination.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to suspect an association with prior ocular surgery. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical case:

1. Patient's surgical history: The patient underwent cataract surgery, YAG capsulotomy, and retinal detachment repair with scleral buckle and pneumatic retinopexy in the left eye about 30 years ago. This extensive surgical history is significant and could be related to the current findings.

2. Presence of a scleral buckle: The case mentions a ""360° encircling band with overlying retinal atrophy,"" which is consistent with a scleral buckle from previous retinal detachment surgery.

3. Characteristics of the mass: The mass is described as ""variably pigmented"" and ""abruptly elevated,"" which could be consistent with a buckle-related foreign body granuloma rather than a typical choroidal melanoma.

4. Ultrasonography findings: The mass is described as ""echodense, with posterior shadowing,"" which is more characteristic of a dense foreign body or surgical material than a typical melanoma.

5. Absence of typical melanoma features: The case specifically notes the absence of drusen, orange pigment, or subretinal fluid, which are often associated with choroidal melanomas.

Given these factors, it's crucial to first consider the possibility that the observed mass is related to the patient's previous ocular surgeries, particularly the scleral buckle, before pursuing more invasive diagnostic or treatment options. This approach aligns with the principle of considering the patient's full medical history and avoiding unnecessary interventions.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

As the most common vasculitis of older adults in North America, giant cell arteritis (GCA) has become the poster child of the arteritic form of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Well established as visually morbid—with an approximate 8% rate of permanent vision loss and a 50% rate of fellow eye involvement—and responsive to corticosteroid therapy, GCA has a low threshold for diagnosis and treatment.1 However, the prevailing criteria for diagnosing GCA (the 1990 American College of Rheumatology classification) is relatively nonspecific, having a specificity of 91.3%.2 Other vasculitides, including eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, polyarteritis nodosa, and Takayasu arteritis, are all cited as misclassifications for GCA in the original article by Hunder et al.2Classic histopathologic findings of GCA include marked narrowing of the arterial lumen by concentric intimal fibroplasia and transmural infiltrate of lymphocytes and macrophages (with or without giant cells), leading to fragmentation, multilamination, and segmental loss of the internal elastic lamina. In chronic cases, a fibrous or fibrovascular scar is present at the level of the internal elastic lamina and frequently involves the tunica media. Examination results of the patient’s temporal artery biopsy specimen were notable for chronic lymphocytic inflammation confined to the adventitia without an appreciable granulomatous component in the vessel wall or breaks in the internal elastic lamina. Although these findings are nondiagnostic for temporal arteritis, they should prompt additional tissue sampling to definitively exclude GCA and call to mind alternative etiologies of adventitial inflammation.3,4 Intravitreal corticosteroid therapies have not been shown to significantly improve visual acuity in patients with ischemic optic neuropathy (choice A).5Patients with clinically diagnosed GCA and partial or absent symptomatic response to corticosteroid therapies should be considered for alternative diagnoses. This includes amyloid deposition in the vessel wall, which may contribute to vision loss via vascular occlusion induced by the amyloid deposit itself or in combination with an inflammatory infiltrate. In the patient, temporal artery amyloidosis was discovered after 1 month of stable vision with persistently elevated inflammatory markers, emblematic of the diagnostic delay frequently seen in these cases. Factors contributing to delay include histopathologic examination misdiagnosis of amyloid as “intimal thickening” or “fibromyxoid change,” and partial clinical improvement with corticosteroid therapy.6 Failure to recognize systemic disease has potentially grave implications, as amyloid light chain amyloidosis has an estimated 30% mortality rate within 18 months.7Patients with temporal artery amyloidosis have a plasma cell dyscrasia in approximately 80% of cases, often in the setting of plasma cell myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and, less frequently, mature B-cell lymphomas.6 Thus, systemic workup for underlying hematolymphoid dyscrasia is warranted and GCA-indicated medications, such as tocilizumab (choice B), are inappropriate. The standard laboratory evaluation includes complete blood cell count with differential and serum and urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation (choice C) for monoclonal immunoglobulin. In addition, a positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan, bone survey, and bone marrow biopsy are performed for comprehensive oncologic examination. According to consensus guidelines, performing a liver biopsy is not indicated (choice D) unless end-organ dysfunction is suspected.8Approximately 1 week after the diagnosis of temporal artery amyloidosis, the patient developed a left footdrop and was hospitalized for uncontrolled atrial fibrillation. Results of a stroke workup were negative for evidence of cerebrovascular accident. Laboratory studies were notable for an elevated ESR of 130 mm/h and mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10). Serum protein electrophoresis testing with immunofixation showed marked elevation of IgM (5214 mg/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01]) and free κ light chains (1200 mg/L; reference, 3.3-19.4 mg/L). Examination of the bone marrow biopsy specimen showed a 60% involvement by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, confirming the diagnosis of IgM-associated monoclonal gammopathy, or Waldenström macroglobulinemia.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate next step would be to order serum and urine protein electrophoresis (Option A). This decision is supported by several key factors from the case:

1. Misdiagnosis of temporal arteritis: The initial diagnosis of temporal arteritis was incorrect. The biopsy review revealed amyloid deposits instead of the typical findings of giant cell arteritis.

2. Presence of amyloid: The temporal artery biopsy showed ""abundant transmural deposits of amorphous eosinophilic acellular material that was congophilic and exhibited apple-green birefringence under polarized light, consistent with amyloid deposits.""

3. Immunohistochemical findings: The biopsy also showed ""IgM and λ light chain restriction,"" which is suggestive of a plasma cell dyscrasia or lymphoproliferative disorder.

4. Persistent inflammation: Despite corticosteroid therapy, there was ""persistent elevation of the ESR and C-reactive protein levels,"" indicating that the underlying condition was not responding to the treatment for temporal arteritis.

Given these findings, particularly the presence of amyloid deposits and the light chain restriction, it is crucial to investigate for systemic amyloidosis, which is often associated with plasma cell dyscrasias such as multiple myeloma or other lymphoproliferative disorders.

Serum and urine protein electrophoresis are essential tests to detect and characterize monoclonal proteins (M-proteins) that are often present in these conditions. These tests can help identify the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy, which is frequently associated with amyloidosis.

The other options are less appropriate:
- Option B (liver biopsy) is too invasive as an initial step and not indicated without further systemic evaluation.
- Option C (intravitreal corticosteroids) would not address the underlying systemic condition.
- Option D (tocilizumab therapy) is used for giant cell arteritis, which has been ruled out by the biopsy findings.

Therefore, ordering serum and urine protein electrophoresis is the most appropriate next step to further investigate the underlying cause of the amyloidosis and guide subsequent management.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Endothelial keratoplasty (choice D), would not be the first step without determining underlying pathology or trying less invasive procedures. Additional treatment with topical agents (choice B) would not be preferred as the patient experienced decreased vision despite 8 weeks of topical therapy.Corneal edema after cataract surgery occurs because of failure of the corneal endothelial pump. Any condition that compromises endothelial cell density, such as endothelial dystrophies, anterior-segment dysgenesis, chronic anterior uveitis, glaucoma, and prior anterior-segment surgical procedures, may potentiate endothelial decompensation after surgery.1Corneal edema in the early postoperative phase is generally secondary to an intraoperative injury to the endothelium and/or DM.1 Inadvertent stripping of DM intraoperatively results in DMD.2 The preoperative risk factors include age older than 65 years, dense nuclear sclerosis, preexisting endothelial dysfunction, and history of DMD in the contralateral eye. The intraoperative risk factors are a shallow anterior chamber and misdirected stream of viscoelastic or fluid creating a plane between posterior stroma and the DM.3 The most common site of DMD (87.5% of cases) is at the main corneal incision and is associated with insertion and removal of instruments. Incidence of vision-impairing DMD varies between 0.044% and 0.5% of cases.4Thorough slitlamp examination is the first step in identifying DMD. A bright, thin slit beam shows a clear optical space between the stroma and DM indicating a DMD. When visualization is limited, AS-OCT can help identify the location and anatomic configuration of the DMD.5Classification of DMD is based on the extent of separation from posterior stroma into planar (≤1 mm) or nonplanar (>1 mm)6; based on location into central or peripheral; based on origin into rhegmatogenous owing to a tear of DM or tractional with fibrotic component; and based on anatomic configuration into bullous, which presents as a smooth bulge, or complex, which has rolls or scrolled edges.7There are several options for management of DMD; the optimal procedure depends on the extent of corneal edema and location of DMD. Observation with administration of topical corticosteroids and hyperosmotic agents may be adequate in localized DMD because spontaneous reattachment can occur. Surgical intervention is often required in cases with central DMD with scrolled edges. Descemetopexy using intracameral injection of sterile air or gas (14% perfluoropropane or 20% sulfur hexafluoride) for tamponade followed by appropriate positioning for at least 24 hours to allow the air or gas to cover the area of the DM break has been shown to result in successful reattachment.8-10 In case of persistent edema, corneal transplant may be required.The patient underwent air descemetopexy.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to perform an endothelial keratoplasty (Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty or Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty).

This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical case:

1. Persistent symptoms: The patient has experienced blurred vision for 8 weeks post-cataract surgery, with no improvement despite current treatment with topical prednisolone acetate.

2. Clinical findings: The examination reveals grade 2 to 3 diffuse central corneal edema and folds in the right eye, which is consistent with endothelial dysfunction. This is further supported by the significantly increased central corneal thickness in the right eye (957 μm) compared to the left eye (547 μm).

3. Duration of symptoms: The persistence of symptoms for 8 weeks suggests that this is not a transient post-operative corneal edema, which typically resolves within a few weeks.

4. Failure of medical management: The patient has already been on topical corticosteroids without improvement, indicating that further medical management is unlikely to resolve the issue.

5. Visual acuity: The patient's best-corrected visual acuity in the right eye is significantly reduced (20/80) compared to the left eye (20/20), indicating a need for more definitive treatment.

Endothelial keratoplasty is the preferred treatment for endothelial dysfunction causing corneal edema, especially in cases of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy, which is likely the diagnosis here given the history of recent cataract surgery. This procedure replaces only the diseased endothelial layer, allowing for faster visual recovery and lower risk of rejection compared to full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty.

Given the chronic nature of the symptoms, the failure of current medical management, and the clear clinical signs of endothelial dysfunction, proceeding with endothelial keratoplasty is the most appropriate next step to restore corneal clarity and improve the patient's vision.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

An 82-year-old man with an ocular history significant for bilateral nuclear sclerotic cataracts presented to the Cornea Service at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, Florida, with a history of blurred vision in the right eye after phacoemulsification cataract extraction 8 weeks earlier. Current ophthalmic medications included topical prednisolone acetate, 1%, in the right eye 6 times per day. The patient reported no improvement with the treatment. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils were reactive without relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 11 mm Hg in the left eye. A slitlamp biomicroscopic examination of the right eye revealed grade 2 to 3 diffuse central corneal edema and folds (Figure 1). The anterior chamber was deep and the posterior chamber intraocular lens was in good position within the capsular bag. Although the view to the posterior pole of the right eye was hazy owing to corneal edema, dilated fundus examination findings were unremarkable. Examination of the left eye revealed a few guttate. The central corneal thickness by ultrasound pachymetry was 957 μm in the right eye and 547 μm in the left eye.Slitlamp biomicroscopic photographs of the right eye show central corneal edema with diffuse illumination (A) and with slitbeam illumination (B).Provide medical management with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline solution for an additional 3 monthsPerform an endothelial keratoplasty (Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty or Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty)

</options>",6.598739385604858,"content=""Answer - A\n\n[Explanation]\nThe most appropriate next step in this case is to perform an endothelial keratoplasty (Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty or Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty).\n\nThis decision is based on several key factors from the clinical case:\n\n1. Persistent symptoms: The patient has experienced blurred vision for 8 weeks post-cataract surgery, with no improvement despite current treatment with topical prednisolone acetate.\n\n2. Clinical findings: The examination reveals grade 2 to 3 diffuse central corneal edema and folds in the right eye, which is consistent with endothelial dysfunction. This is further supported by the significantly increased central corneal thickness in the right eye (957 μm) compared to the left eye (547 μm).\n\n3. Duration of symptoms: The persistence of symptoms for 8 weeks suggests that this is not a transient post-operative corneal edema, which typically resolves within a few weeks.\n\n4. Failure of medical management: The patient has already been on topical corticosteroids without improvement, indicating that further medical management is unlikely to resolve the issue.\n\n5. Visual acuity: The patient's best-corrected visual acuity in the right eye is significantly reduced (20/80) compared to the left eye (20/20), indicating a need for more definitive treatment.\n\nEndothelial keratoplasty is the preferred treatment for endothelial dysfunction causing corneal edema, especially in cases of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy, which is likely the diagnosis here given the history of recent cataract surgery. This procedure replaces only the diseased endothelial layer, allowing for faster visual recovery and lower risk of rejection compared to full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty.\n\nGiven the chronic nature of the symptoms, the failure of current medical management, and the clear clinical signs of endothelial dysfunction, proceeding with endothelial keratoplasty is the most appropriate next step to restore corneal clarity and improve the patient's vision."" response_metadata={'id': 'msg_vrtx_01CKGKKYmKJqNpX3s8mhrKvL', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 798, 'output_tokens': 477}} id='run-0e2e19f3-32c2-4630-bec4-34b3fbc39d93-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 798, 'output_tokens': 477, 'total_tokens': 1275}",0.0

Her chief complaint was acute onset of blurry vision in the right eye. She described intermittent foggy vision and the appearance of “a hair moving across the vision of her right eye” for the past few weeks. Her most recent hemoglobin A1c level was 8.3%, and 2 months prior to her visit, she had restarted diabetes medications. Her medications included metformin and glimepiride.

Diabetic papillopathy can classically be differentiated from NVD by its radially oriented telangiectasias, which do not extend into the vitreous, while NVD has a random branching pattern and can extend into the vitreous.1,2 Diabetic papillopathy has a favorable prognosis, and most cases resolve spontaneously within 4 to 8 months.1,2 Small observational studies have reported improvement of optic disc edema with intravitreal or periocular steroids,3 vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (choice C),4 or panretinal photocoagulation (choice D).5 However, there appear to be no strong data for such treatments, and diabetic papillopathy can typically be observed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (choice B) can be considered if compressive optic neuropathy or papilledema is suspected; unilateral papilledema cases have been reported but are uncommon.6 While it is not unreasonable to rule out these conditions with imaging, the absence of an afferent pupillary defect or other neurological deficits make these diagnoses less likely.Diabetic papillopathy was first described in 1971 in young patients with type 1 diabetes and has since been described in older patients with type 2 diabetes.1,2,7 It is characterized by unilateral or bilateral optic disc edema with normal or mildly abnormal visual acuity and spontaneous resolution in most cases. Risk factors include a small cup-disc ratio, long-standing diabetes, and rapid improvement with metabolic control.1,2,8 Patients may be asymptomatic or report nonspecific vision complaints, such as mild blurring or distortion of vision. Ophthalmoscopic examinations reveal focal or diffuse optic disc edema, peripapillary hemorrhages, and characteristic dilated telangiectatic vessels overlying the optic nerve head. The preretinal hemorrhages seen in this patient are possible but rare with diabetic papillopathy and are more characteristic of NVD. Fluorescein angiography classically reveals early hyperfluorescence and late leakage around the optic nerve head.1,2Recent studies suggest that optical coherence tomography angiography may be helpful in differentiating diabetic papillopathy from NVD.9 Optical coherence tomography angiography in this case showed abnormal vessels limited to the optic disc without extension into the vitreous, supporting a diagnosis of diabetic papillopathy (Figure 2).Optical coherence tomography angiography with superficial segmentation of the right optic nerve at presentation, showing vessels limited to the optic disc without extension into the vitreous. The temporal disc edema is seen on the cross-sectional image.Although some suggest that diabetic papillopathy is a mild or early form of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy,10 this can be distinguished from diabetic papillopathy by its relatively severe symptoms, including decreased visual acuity, relative afferent pupillary defect, dyschromatopsia, visual field defects, persistent optic nerve pallor, and worse visual prognosis. Other than NVD and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, the differential diagnosis of diabetic papillopathy could include papilledema, papillitis, compressive optic neuropathy, toxic or nutritional optic neuropathy, malignant hypertension, and optic disc drusen.Diabetic papillopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. A workup for diabetic papillopathy should include fluorescein angiography and potentially optical coherence tomography angiography. Patients with bilateral disc edema or neurologic deficits should undergo neuroimaging.Six months later, the patient reported a complete resolution of her symptoms.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. This decision is based on several key factors from the case:

1. Atypical presentation: While the patient has a history of diabetes and some signs of diabetic retinopathy, the described symptoms and findings are not typical for proliferative diabetic retinopathy alone. The acute onset of blurry vision, the description of ""a hair moving across the vision,"" and the unilateral nature of the more severe findings suggest an alternative or additional diagnosis.

2. Optic disc abnormalities: The posterior segment examination of the right eye showed mild temporal elevation of the optic disc with blurred margins and small-caliber branching vessels at the temporal disc. These findings, especially when unilateral, are concerning for an optic disc neovascularization that may not be solely due to diabetic retinopathy.

3. Asymmetry between eyes: The significant difference in findings between the right and left eyes, particularly the optic disc appearance, suggests a process that may not be entirely explained by systemic diabetes.

4. Potential for other underlying conditions: Given the atypical presentation, there is a need to rule out other possible causes of optic disc swelling and neovascularization, such as optic nerve head drusen, ischemic optic neuropathy, or even a space-occupying lesion affecting the optic nerve.

An MRI of the brain would help to:
- Rule out any intracranial or orbital pathology that might be causing or contributing to the optic disc changes.
- Evaluate the optic nerves and surrounding structures for any abnormalities.
- Provide crucial information to guide further management, whether it confirms diabetic changes or reveals an alternative diagnosis.

While diabetic retinopathy is present, the atypical features warrant further investigation before proceeding with treatments specific to proliferative diabetic retinopathy, such as panretinal photocoagulation or anti-VEGF injections. The MRI results will be essential in determining the most appropriate treatment plan for this patient.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

At the time of IAC, she had an upper respiratory tract infection (coughing, congestion, rhinorrhea, fever [temperature of 38.9 °C]). On postoperative day 1, her temperature reached 39.4 °C, and she was diagnosed as having bilateral acute otitis media and discharged with amoxicillin therapy. On postoperative day 3, she returned to the emergency department with left eye swelling, continued fever, and poor oral intake. On physical examination, her temperature was 40.2 °C, and periorbital swelling and erythema were present without drainage. Dilated fundus examination at the bedside showed the known large retinoblastoma tumor. A large exudative retinal detachment was noted, which was not present prior to treatment.

B, Orbital computed tomography on presentation, demonstrating preseptal and periorbital soft tissue swelling and edema with subtle retrobulbar stranding along with retinal detachment (arrowheads). There was no substantial proptosis or orbital masses. What Would You Do Next?",Begin intravenous vancomycin and cefepime,Perform examination under anesthesia,Start systemic corticosteroids,Observe,Periorbital edema related to administration of IAC,C,Start systemic corticosteroids,"The differential diagnosis of eye swelling in a patient with cancer receiving chemotherapy includes infectious (preseptal/orbital cellulitis), neoplastic (extraocular/orbital tumor), and inflammatory causes. IAC involves delivering chemotherapy into the ophthalmic artery via endovascular microcatheter, navigated under fluoroscopic guidance, either directly, balloon assisted, or via an external carotid artery anastomosis.1 IAC is increasingly used for retinoblastoma, both as first-line and salvage therapy after failed intravenous chemotherapy, due to increased efficacy of IAC for advanced intraocular disease.2 Globe salvage rates for International Classification of Retinoblastoma group D eyes with IAC (85.1%) exceed published rates for intravenous chemoreduction (36.7%).3IAC may cause several ocular complications, most commonly transient periorbital swelling and erythema, reported in 22% of patients.4 This may be more common with an external carotid anastomotic approach5 and is most often seen in patients receiving multiagent infusions. Animal models suggest that this is possibly due to carboplatin-induced vascular damage leading to increased exudation/transudation.6,7 While generally self-limited, recovery can be hastened by administering systemic steroids, and these can be given prophylactically in patients receiving triple therapy.8 Parents should be prewarned that periorbital swelling is a known consequence of IAC that resolves. Other permanent and vision-threatening ocular complications of IAC, though rare, have been reported.3,4IAC avoids many of the systemic adverse events of intravenous chemotherapy. Neutropenia does occur in approximately 30% to 40% of patients receiving IAC, although at rates much less than those seen with intravenous chemotherapy.3,6 IAC is not associated with the degree of profound neutropenia seen with intravenous chemotherapy, and neutropenic fever is extremely rare.9 Thus, typical chemotherapy-associated infectious causes of fever are not seen with IAC, as they are with intravenous chemotherapy. In thinking about this patient, the differential should not reflect the common causes of swelling and fever seen in a postchemotherapy (ie, immunosuppressed) patient with cancer. This is especially true here, where there is a more likely explanation for both the swelling (expected post-IAC orbital edema) and the fever (known preexisting bilateral otitis media).Noninfectious, post-IAC periocular inflammation is the most likely etiology for the patient’s findings. While this could be expected to gradually resolve without intervention (D), intravenous steroids hasten recovery, and thus, C is the best option for management8 once the otitis media was controlled with antibiotics. Intravenous vancomycin and cefepime (A) is the treatment for infectious orbital cellulitis, which is not the correct diagnosis. Performing an examination under anesthesia (B) is unnecessary since the diagnosis of post-IAC swelling is clear and because results of bedside fundus examination were adequate. Anesthesia should be avoided when unnecessary in children, especially with active otitis media, and the child had received general anesthesia for the IAC procedure just 3 days prior.Lastly, this patient already had computed tomography performed on presentation to the emergency department due to concerns about infectious orbital cellulitis. Although unnecessary, this did not expose this child to significant harm because she had unilateral (nongermline) retinoblastoma. In contrast, in children with bilateral/germline retinoblastoma, all forms of radiation should be assiduously avoided. Children with bilateral/germline retinoblastoma are at risk of developing second (nonocular) malignancies and are highly sensitive to radiation-induced mutations. Studies report that external radiotherapy iatrogenically increases their risk of second malignancies.10The patient started receiving dexamethasone, 1 mg, once every 6 hours for the periocular edema, which improved within 1 day, and intravenous ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg, once for the otitis media, which resolved. She was discharged home on postoperative day 5 with an oral steroid taper. She subsequently underwent an additional IAC treatment without complication (same doses, same intravenous dexamethasone, but with oral steroid taper), leading to complete regression of her tumor.",Ophthalmology,2021-01-01,2021,1,"A 9-month-old girl presented to the emergency department with significant left periocular edema and erythema 3 days after receiving intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) with 0.4 mg/kg of melphalan, 50 mg of carboplatin, and 2 mg of topotecan (with routine intravenous dexamethasone therapy, 0.5 mg/kg) for treatment of unilateral International Classification of Retinoblastoma group C retinoblastoma in the left eye (Figure, A).

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to start systemic corticosteroids. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Timing and context: The periocular edema and erythema developed 3 days after intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC), suggesting a possible inflammatory reaction to the treatment.

2. Exclusion of infection: While the patient had an upper respiratory infection and otitis media, blood cultures showed no growth, and the CT scan did not reveal signs of orbital cellulitis or abscess.

3. Presence of inflammation: The clinical picture (periorbital swelling, erythema) and CT findings (preseptal and periorbital soft tissue swelling, retrobulbar stranding) are consistent with an inflammatory response.

4. Known side effect: Periocular edema is a recognized side effect of IAC, particularly with melphalan.

5. Exudative retinal detachment: This new finding suggests an inflammatory process affecting the eye.

Systemic corticosteroids would help reduce the inflammation and potentially prevent further complications. They are particularly indicated given the presence of the exudative retinal detachment, which could threaten vision if left untreated.

Option B (observe) is less appropriate given the severity of symptoms and potential risk to vision. Option C (examination under anesthesia) might be necessary later but is not the immediate priority. Option D (intravenous antibiotics) is not indicated without clear evidence of bacterial infection, which is lacking in this case.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

However, radiographic findings raised suspicion of an alternate pathology:In TAO, the inferior rectus consistently has the greatest diameter, whereas the lateral rectus has the smallest.1,5 In this patient, there was marked enlargement of both lateral rectus muscles beyond that of either inferior rectus (Figure 1B).Extraocular muscle (EOM) enlargement in TAO typically appears as fusiform expansion of the entire muscle belly, sparing anterior tendinous insertions to the globe. In this patient, enlargement was predominantly confined to the posterior two-thirds of the muscle belly with rapid tapering into an unaffected anterior third. This finding has been dubbed the amphora sign and may be a feature of EOM lymphoma (Figure 1B) (Dr G. Rose, MD, written correspondence, November 12, 2018).A study of 108 TAO orbits demonstrated that, although EOM diameter does not correlate well with clinically restricted ductions, when a rectus muscle diameter exceeds 8 mm, that muscle invariably yields clinical restriction.1 This patient demonstrated free ductions, despite each rectus diameter exceeding 8 mm (Figure 1B).1In TAO, the inferior rectus consistently has the greatest diameter, whereas the lateral rectus has the smallest.1,5 In this patient, there was marked enlargement of both lateral rectus muscles beyond that of either inferior rectus (Figure 1B).Extraocular muscle (EOM) enlargement in TAO typically appears as fusiform expansion of the entire muscle belly, sparing anterior tendinous insertions to the globe.

Therefore, despite the associated risks, including strabismus, EOM biopsy (C) was the appropriate next step. Biopsy of the left lateral rectus revealed a pale and friable muscle densely infiltrated by small CD4+ and CD8− T cells, which mirrored flow cytometry findings from the patient’s prior indolent-phase T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia diagnosis.Orbital myositis, the second most common EOM pathology, was also considered. Orbital myositis is typically a unilateral, acute, painful, diplopia-inducing disease in young women.6 Although stereotypical orbital myositis can be empirically treated without biopsy,6 this patient’s age and chronic, bilateral, painless presentation rendered this diagnosis unlikely.Intravenous steroids (A) are the first-line therapy for active TAO.7 However, when EOMs are enlarged because of hematologic malignancy, corticosteroids may cause misleading improvement and diagnostic delay. Furthermore, prior corticosteroid use may yield false-negative histopathological results from eventual biopsy.8Orbital decompression (B) is most commonly performed in patients with TAO who have optic neuropathy refractory to steroids, disfiguring proptosis, or corneal breakdown.7 Orbital radiation (D) is currently considered a second-line therapy and may be synergistic with corticosteroids in active TAO.8 Although radiotherapy may be used in the treatment of orbital hematologic malignancy, this is typically only after confirmatory histopathology.This patient was treated with oral cyclosporine. Within 3 days, EOM volume dramatically decreased and proptosis reduced bilaterally by 9 mm (Figure 2).

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and the patient's medical history, performing an extraocular muscle biopsy (option A) is the most appropriate next step.

The patient presents with bilateral proptosis, conjunctival erythema, and marked enlargement of all extraocular muscles, as evidenced by CT scan. While these symptoms might initially suggest thyroid eye disease, the normal thyroid function tests (TSH, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, and thyroid peroxidase antibody) make this diagnosis less likely.

The patient's history of two hematologic malignancies (retroperitoneal extranodal marginal zone lymphoma and indolent-phase T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia) is particularly significant. Given this history, there's a possibility that the orbital involvement could be related to these malignancies or represent a new malignant process.

A muscle biopsy would provide definitive histological diagnosis, which is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment plan. It could reveal whether the orbital involvement is due to:

1. Lymphomatous infiltration related to her known hematologic malignancies
2. A new primary orbital lymphoma
3. A non-malignant inflammatory process

The other options are less appropriate at this stage:

B. Orbital decompression would be premature without a definitive diagnosis.
C. Radiation therapy would be inappropriate without confirming the nature of the orbital disease.
D. High-dose steroids might be helpful for inflammatory conditions but could potentially worsen an underlying malignancy if present.

Therefore, a biopsy is the most logical next step to guide further management and ensure the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Six days prior, he had presented with an inferior stromal infiltrate with an overlying epithelial defect, diffuse corneal edema, and a small hypopyon with no hemorrhage in the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). He also had patchy iris hemorrhages with no transillumination defects and areas of conjunctival ulceration nasally and temporally. He denied contact lens use.

Vitamin A serum levels were less than 5 μg/dL (reference range, 38-98 μg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.0349). Conjunctival findings were consistent with Bitot spots (Figure 2), and the cornea bullae were thought to be attributable to herpes zoster sine herpete. A gastroenterology assessment revealed severe esophagitis and chronic pancreatitis secondary to alcohol use. He started receiving oral vitamin A at 10 000 units daily.Continuing treatment with topical antibiotics (choice A) is not recommended, because the patient no longer had an infiltrate and the new findings occurred with appropriate antibiotic treatment. Nontuberculous mycobacteria, which is cultured with Lowenstein-Jensen media (choice B), can cause nonhealing corneal ulcers; however, this patient did not have risk factors for nontuberculous mycobacteria, such as steroid use, contact lenses, or a history of ocular surgery.2 Sjögren syndrome, which is tested with anti-Ro and anti-La tests (choice C), can cause severe dry eye and corneal ulceration, but it is not associated with Bitot spots.Globally, vitamin A deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies in children,3 with 30% of children younger than 5 years estimated to be vitamin A deficient.4 Vitamin A supplementation in children in low-resource settings decreases blindness and all-cause mortality, possibly because of reduction of diarrhea and measles.5 In the US, vitamin A deficiency is one of the least common nutritional deficiencies.6 As a fat-soluble vitamin, vitamin A deficiency in the US is usually associated with malabsorption or poor vitamin metabolism because of liver disease.7 Patients with alcohol use disorders are at risk for vitamin A deficiency because of overall malnutrition; however, chronic alcohol use also depletes stores of liver retinoid, a form of vitamin A, independent of nutritional status and gastrointestinal absorption.8In the eye, vitamin A deficiency leads to xerophthalmia, a spectrum of ocular diseases including nyctalopia, corneal xerosis, and keratomalacia. In the retina, vitamin A is a precursor for photosensitive pigment, and deficiency disrupts phototransduction of photoreceptors, causing nyctalopia. In the conjunctiva, vitamin A deficiency decreases goblet cells that can cause squamous metaplasia of epithelial cells and Bitot spots, which are keratinized conjunctival debris. A decrease in conjunctival goblet cells also creates inadequate tear films and corneal xerosis, which can lead to epithelial defects that may progress to ulceration. Other possible corneal sequelae include keratomalacia, which is liquefactive necrosis of the cornea, stromal loss with Desmetoceles, or even corneal perforation.7Although vitamin A deficiency is rare in the US, it should be considered in patients with risk factors of poor dietary intake, malabsorption because of bariatric surgeries, or chronic liver diseases. Evaluation of the entire ocular surface and tear film can provide helpful clues for corneal ulcerations.After several weeks of supplementation, oral antiviral use, and aggressive lubrication, the patient’s corneal and conjunctival findings resolved.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and the new findings, obtaining serum vitamin levels (Option A) is the most appropriate next step. Here's why:

1. New epithelial defect and subepithelial bullae: The patient developed a new, larger epithelial defect and subepithelial bullae despite initial improvement. This suggests a potential underlying issue with epithelial healing and maintenance.

2. Dull conjunctival reflexes and bulbar conjunctival lesions: These findings, along with the patchy interpalpebral staining and punctate epithelial erosions, indicate a more widespread ocular surface problem beyond the initial infection.

3. History of alcohol use disorder: Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with various nutritional deficiencies, particularly vitamin deficiencies that can affect ocular health.

4. Potential vitamin A deficiency: The clinical picture, especially the dull conjunctival reflexes, conjunctival lesions, and corneal epithelial issues, is consistent with vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is crucial for maintaining the health of epithelial tissues, including those of the eye.

5. Other potential vitamin deficiencies: The patient's history of alcohol use disorder and diabetes also puts him at risk for other vitamin deficiencies, such as thiamine (B1) or riboflavin (B2), which can affect ocular health.

Obtaining serum vitamin levels will help identify any underlying nutritional deficiencies that may be contributing to the patient's ocular surface problems and impaired healing. This information would guide appropriate supplementation and potentially improve the overall management of the patient's condition.

The other options are less appropriate at this stage:
- Option B (continuing current antibiotics) doesn't address the new findings.
- Option C (anti-Ro and anti-La tests) is not indicated based on the presented symptoms.

Finally, observation (choice D) would not be preferred because the patient is experiencing visual issues due to the lesion, and other conditions, such as a malignant neoplasm, should be excluded.Corneal intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), also known as corneal epithelial dysplasia, is usually grouped with conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia under the broader classification of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). Ocular surface squamous neoplasia is one of the most common ocular tumors in the US and is generally found in males of advanced age.1 Risk factors include prolonged exposure to UV light, infection with human papillomavirus or human immunodeficiency virus, smoking, and immunosuppression.2 Patients customarily present with nonspecific progressive symptoms of painless vision loss, which may be associated with ocular foreign body sensation or redness.3 Corneal intraepithelial neoplasia onset is typically in the limbal area, with a gradual extension toward the central visual axis. Lesions may or may not be accompanied by neovascularization.Given its translucent, lusterless, sheetlike appearance, CIN may be misdiagnosed as a corneal dystrophy, corneal pannus, pterygium, or viral keratitis.3 Although rare, Lisch epithelial dystrophy may present asymmetrically, and look similar to CIN on clinical examination.4 Histopathologic examination can be valuable for confirming the diagnosis. Histologically, dysplastic cells stain for vimentin and keratin 14.3Impression cytology, high-definition AS-OCT, and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), have all been described in establishing the diagnosis of CIN/OSSN.1,3,5,6 Impression cytology requires an expert ocular pathologist and cannot differentiate between dysplasia and invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the deeper layers.3 More recent publications on AS-OCT and IVCM have reported on the use of these noninvasive techniques to provide “optical biopsies” in establishing the diagnosis as well as for early detection of recurrent or residual disease.1,3,6 In CIN, AS-OCT demonstrates hyperreflectivity and thickening of the epithelium.1,6 In vivo confocal microscopy has been reported to correlate well with histologic findings in CIN.3 The major limitation of IVCM, however, is its inability to provide either cross-sectional views or an entire scan of the whole ocular surface, making it difficult to correlate scans in follow-up imaging (Figure 2).Pathology specimen. Photomicrograph of a cross-section of corneal squamous epithelium with dysplasia of the basal layers characterized by disorganization, lack of maturation, and nuclear atypia (hematoxylin-eosin; original magnification ×400).Traditionally, treatment for OSSN was surgical excision with or without adjunctive cryotherapy.6,7 However, this method has a recurrence rate ranging between 33% and 56%.6 The translucency of the lesion can make it challenging to determine, by clinical examination alone, the extent of conjunctival involvement as the subclinical microscopic disease can be missed.1 The most popular gold standard is to combine surgical excision with the addition of chemotherapeutic drops, such as interferon alfa-2b, fluorouracil, or mitomycin C.1 Interferon alfa-2b is often the preferred option because of its efficacy and limited side effects, but it can be more expensive.1,6,8The patient’s histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of corneal intraepithelial neoplasia, and he underwent interferon alpha-2b topical treatment.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and the patient's history, the most appropriate next step would be to discuss superficial keratectomy to confirm the diagnosis by histopathologic examination.

The reasons for this decision are:

1. Suspicious clinical features: The patient presents with a grayish corneal opacity that is lusterless and extends into the visual axis. This appearance, combined with the patient's history of multiple skin malignancies, raises concern for a possible ocular surface neoplasm, such as ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN).

2. History of skin cancer: The patient's history of multiple skin malignancies, including recent Mohs surgery for squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the lateral canthus in the fellow eye, increases the risk of ocular surface malignancy.

3. Inconclusive imaging: While the AS-OCT shows a hyperreflective thickened epithelium, it does not definitively rule out malignancy. The lesion appears to be limited to the epithelium, which is consistent with early-stage OSSN.

4. Need for definitive diagnosis: Given the potential for malignancy and the impact on vision, a definitive diagnosis is crucial for appropriate management. Superficial keratectomy allows for histopathologic examination, which is the gold standard for diagnosis in such cases.

5. Therapeutic potential: If the lesion is indeed OSSN or another neoplastic process, superficial keratectomy can serve as both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure, potentially removing the entire lesion.

6. Risk-benefit analysis: The risks of superficial keratectomy are relatively low compared to the potential benefit of early diagnosis and treatment of a possible malignancy.

Observation (option D) would be inappropriate given the risk of malignancy and the impact on vision. Calcium chelation (option A) is not indicated based on the clinical presentation. Penetrating keratoplasty (option B) would be overly aggressive without a confirmed diagnosis and clear indication.

Therefore, discussing superficial keratectomy for histopathologic examination is the most appropriate next step in this case.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Results found an opening pressure of 54 cm H2O; normal cerebrospinal fluid composition; 1 white blood cell/μL (to convert to cells × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.0001); 1 red blood cell/μL (to convert to cells × 106 per liter, multiply by 1.0); a protein level of 0.012 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0); and a glucose level of 52 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). Head magnetic resonance imaging and venography with intravenous contrast showed bilateral otomastoiditis and right sigmoid sinus thrombosis (Figure 1). Bilateral myringotomy and tube placement produced thick purulent drainage that grew mixed aerobic flora. She continued broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics and began receiving ciprofloxacin drops to both ears. For the elevated ICP, she began 500 mg of oral acetazolamide daily. For the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin was started and later bridged to enoxaparin for a 3-month treatment course (choice B). After discharge, she completed a month of oral antibiotics. Six months later, her visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and her papilledema had resolved.Papilledema and CNVI palsies are rare complications of otitis media.2,3 Treatment strategies include antibiotics, surgery (myringotomy and/or mastoidectomy), and anticoagulation.4 Acetazolamide can be used if there are symptoms and/or signs of elevated ICP.4 Optic nerve sheath fenestration or cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures (choice C) can be considered when ICP does not respond to infection management or acetazolamide. Intravenous steroids (choice D) are not likely to improve ICP in this setting.A recent 10-year series4 found 13 patients with lateral sinus thrombosis among 156 patients with otitis media and/or mastoiditis. All of those with lateral sinus thrombosis also had cranial nerve (CN) palsies, primarily in CNVI or, more rarely, CNVII, and objective evidence of raised ICP. Another series2 found that 4 of 5 patients with both otitis media and dural venous sinus thrombosis also had papilledema and diplopia. Notably, neurologic symptoms and signs were often more prominent than otologic ones. Headache was the most common complaint. Additional symptoms included diplopia, CN palsies, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, and/or ataxia.4In otitis media, extension of the middle ear cavity infection and associated venous sinus wall inflammation cause a prothrombotic state, leading to CVST (Figure 2). Resulting venous drainage impairment causes raised ICP and associated headache, pulse-synchronous tinnitus, and transient visual obscurations. Elevated ICP causes downward brainstem herniation, CNVI traction, diplopia, and associated palsies. Subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid compression causes disrupted axoplasmic flow through the optic nerves, resulting in papilledema. Inflammation of the overlying dura may affect adjacent CNs.3 Untreated CVST may progress to meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, seizure, and death.5 Before antibiotics, mortality was as high as 80%; antibiotics have dropped the rate to 5% to 10%.5In otitis media, infection of the middle ear cavity and associated venous wall inflammation can extend into surrounding structures, creating a prothrombotic state and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Increased intracranial pressure results from impaired venous drainage, which can lead to papilledema and cranial nerve palsies, most commonly of the sixth (abducens) cranial nerve (CN). A indicates artery; n, nerve.Although meningitis may also present with CNVI palsy and papilledema, this patient lacked classic meningeal signs, such as nuchal rigidity, cerebrospinal fluid leukocytosis, or positive culture results. If the infection extends to the petrous apex, ipsilateral CNVI palsies and severe deep facial pain attributable to trigeminal nerve inflammation present as Gradenigo syndrome. This patient lacked petrous apex findings on magnetic resonance imaging and did not have the characteristic deep facial pain, making this an unlikely diagnosis. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension was unlikely, given identifiable causes of ICP, such as CVST and mastoiditis.Neurologic and ophthalmic complications of otitis media persist even in the era of modern antibiotic therapy. When evaluating patients with otitis media, unrelenting headache, particularly when accompanied by vomiting and double vision, should alert the clinician to consider CVST.6",Ophthalmology,2020-12-01,2020,12,"A previously healthy 4-year-old girl who was up-to-date on all vaccinations, including Haemophilus influenzae, presented to her pediatrician with 2 days of fever and 1 day of right ear pain.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most appropriate next step is to initiate anticoagulation (Option C). The patient has developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) secondary to mastoiditis, which is a serious complication of otitis media.

The key factors supporting this decision are:

1. Clinical presentation: The patient initially presented with ear pain and fever, which progressed to headaches, vomiting, and visual symptoms. This progression suggests a complication of the initial ear infection.

2. Imaging findings: The MRI and MRV reveal right sigmoid sinus thrombosis and bilateral mastoiditis, which are consistent with CVST secondary to mastoiditis.

3. Ophthalmological findings: The presence of bilateral papilledema (stage 3) indicates increased intracranial pressure, which is a common feature of CVST.

4. Progression despite antibiotics: The patient's condition worsened despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, suggesting a thrombotic complication.

Initiating anticoagulation is crucial in managing CVST to prevent further clot propagation and to facilitate recanalization of the occluded sinus. This treatment aims to reduce the risk of venous infarction and intracranial hypertension.

The other options are less appropriate:
A. Lumbar puncture: While this could help diagnose increased intracranial pressure, it's contraindicated in the presence of papilledema due to the risk of herniation.
B. High-dose intravenous steroids: Not typically indicated as first-line treatment for CVST.
D. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement: This is an invasive procedure and not the initial management for CVST.

Anticoagulation, along with continued antibiotic therapy for the underlying infection, is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Kearns-Sayre syndrome is a rare (1-3 per 100 000 individuals), sporadic disorder of mitochondrial DNA that typically presents before age 20 years.1 Most often it is diagnosed in the first decade of life. The disease is characterized by progressive external ophthalmoplegia, retinal pigmentary degeneration, and heart block. Additional features include short stature, delayed sexual maturation, and widespread neurological findings affecting the cerebellar, pyramidal, and extrapyramidal motor systems.2 There are also reports of patients developing corneal clouding, the severity of which can range from small microcystic changes to complete haziness requiring penetrating keratoplasty.2,3The classic triad of KSS consists of progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), pigmentary retinopathy, and age at onset younger than 20 years,4 but not all these have to be present for diagnosis. Patients with PEO who meet some but not all the criteria for KSS are considered “KSS minus” or “PEO plus.”4,5 Ultimately, lack of 1 part of the classic triad should not delay a timely cardiology workup, as conduction defects can be life threatening. Diagnosis is made clinically, but muscle biopsy or genetic testing for mitochondrial mutations can be confirmatory.The differential diagnosis for progressive limitation of ocular movements and ptosis includes other mitochondrial disorders such as chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia; congenital disorders such as congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles; genetic disorders such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy; and acquired autoimmune conditions such as ocular sarcoidosis, myasthenia gravis, or thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. Thyroid eye disease commonly affects eye motility and alignment, but bilateral involvement is often asymmetric, ophthalmoplegia is usually not complete, and ptosis is not associated.Proceeding immediately to surgical repair of ptosis with frontalis sling (choice A) was inappropriate in this case because the patient had other signs (ophthalmoplegia) that could not be explained by congenital ptosis alone, and the patient would face significant sequelae if a diagnosis of heart block were missed. In addition, his symptoms began at age 16 years; congenital ptosis is usually present or noted shortly after birth. Neuroimaging (choice B) is not useful in the initial workup of KSS but may be used to evaluate possible neurological findings later in the course of the disease. Although thyroid eye disease (choice D) may cause eyelid malposition, eyelid retraction or proptosis is more common than blepharoptosis.The patient was referred to the pediatric cardiology service, and a subsequent electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia. He did not require a pacemaker but was counseled to follow up annually for serial electrocardiograms and Holter monitoring.

Given the clinical presentation of this 18-year-old man with progressive bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia over the past two years, the most appropriate next step would be to order neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast.

The rationale for this decision is as follows:

1. Progressive nature: The symptoms have been gradually progressing over two years, suggesting a potentially serious underlying condition that requires investigation before any surgical intervention.

2. Bilateral involvement: The presence of bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia points towards a systemic or neurological cause rather than a localized issue.

3. Extent of ophthalmoplegia: The patient has significant limitations in eye movements in multiple directions, which could indicate a problem affecting the extraocular muscles, their innervation, or both.

4. Normal visual acuity and fundus: Despite the severe ptosis, the patient's visual acuity is preserved, and fundoscopic examination is normal. This suggests that the problem is likely not retinal or optic nerve-related.

5. No systemic symptoms: The absence of fatigue, generalized muscle weakness, or other neurological deficits doesn't rule out a neurological cause but narrows down the differential diagnosis.

An MRI of the brain and orbits would help to:
- Rule out space-occupying lesions in the brain or orbits
- Evaluate the extraocular muscles and their innervation
- Assess for any inflammatory or infiltrative processes
- Look for any structural abnormalities that could explain the symptoms

It's crucial to obtain a clear understanding of the underlying cause before considering any surgical intervention.

<clinical_case>
An 18-year-old man with unremarkable medical history was referred to the oculoplastics service for evaluation of progressive gradual-onset ptosis and ophthalmoplegia in both eyes in the past 2 years (Figure). He had emigrated from Ghana 2 years before but denied any illness there. His visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS, although he had to manually elevate his eyelids to see the Snellen chart. He had no movement of the right eye past midline in elevation, adduction, depression, and abduction and no movement of the left eye past midline in elevation, depression, and abduction, with 50% deficit of adduction. His external examination results were notable for a margin reflex distance 1 of −4 mm OU and a levator function of 0 OU. On funduscopic examination, his optic nerves were sharp and pink without atrophy, maculae and retinal vasculature were normal, and peripheral retina appeared normal without pigment abnormalities.

She had no associated fever, chills, upper respiratory tract symptoms, lethargy, or changes in behavior. She had an unremarkable ocular and medical history. On examination, visual acuity was fix-and-follow in each eye. Both eyes were soft to palpation. Pupils were round, symmetric, and reactive to light without an afferent pupillary defect. Ocular movements were full, and the patient had grossly full visual fields to confrontation. External examination revealed mild left-sided ptosis, axial proptosis, and upper eyelid fullness with no mass or tenderness to palpation (Figure, A). Slitlamp and fundus examination results were unremarkable, and there was no left optic nerve edema or pallor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a left intraconal mass that was isointense relative to rectus muscles on T1-weighted images and hypointense with a hyperintense rim on T2-weighted images (Figure, B).A, Clinical photograph showing left upper eyelid fullness (arrowhead) and mild axial proptosis.

Neuroimaging modalities, such as MRI or computed tomography (CT), can be very helpful in differentiating among these lesion types. This patient’s MRI, however, did not show distinguishing features to assist in narrowing the differential diagnosis. It would be inappropriate to observe a new and undifferentiated orbital mass that could potentially be life threatening, vision threatening, or both (choice A). As recommended by the neuroradiology service, CT scanning was performed to further characterize the mass and make an accurate diagnosis (choice B). Although biopsy is the criterion standard for diagnosis, multimodal imaging can sometimes accurately identify a benign mass and make an invasive biopsy unnecessary (choice C). This minimizes the risk of complications such as hemorrhage, which is especially true in vascular lesions. Aggressive treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy should not be initiated until after a diagnosis is established because these treatments are appropriate only for certain malignant lesions, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, optic nerve glioblastoma, and orbital metastasis (choice D).The CT scan of the orbits showed a hyperdense mass with Hounsfield units between 70 and 80, characteristic of the presence of blood. Given the imaging findings and acute onset after vomiting, a presumptive diagnosis of venolymphatic malformation with acute intralesional hemorrhage was made.Venolymphatic malformations, also known as lymphangiomas, are developmental anomalies of venous and lymphatic vessels that manifest during infancy or childhood. They are composed of large dilated lymphatic vessels lined by endothelial cells with fibroblastic or collagenous stroma. Orbital venolymphatic malformations (OVLMs) account for 1% to 4% of all orbital masses and 10% to 25% of all orbital vascular lesions in all age groups.1 They typically grow slowly and are asymptomatic, but they can present acutely with intralesional hemorrhage precipitated by respiratory infection, trauma, or rarely the Valsalva maneuver.2 Symptoms include ptosis, proptosis, and extraocular muscle restriction, but acute optic nerve compression can be seen.Magnetic resonance imaging of OVLM typically shows an unencapsulated mass that is hyperintense to muscle on T1- and T2-weighted images and has internal septations and fluid-fluid levels.3 However, some lesions can appear encapsulated and have atypical imaging characteristics, necessitating a multimodal imaging approach.4 OVLMs are classified according to cytopathologic findings, angiogenesis, and hemodynamic measurements as well as blood flow type, cyst size, and cyst depth.5No definitive treatment or criterion standard exists for management of OVLMs. If the lesion is small, asymptomatic, and not threatening vision, observation with routine surveillance is a reasonable option.6 If the lesion causes acute proptosis and optic nerve compression, then emergent decompression should be pursued. Patients with acute intralesional hemorrhage should have close follow-up for early detection of optic nerve compression. These acute episodes typically resolve spontaneously, after which patients can be monitored routinely with instructions to seek care immediately if there is an acute change. For lesions that are slowly enlarging, symptomatic, or causing cosmetic issues, both surgical and nonsurgical treatment options are available. Surgery was previously the first-line treatment but has now fallen out of favor because of technical difficulty, risks, and poor outcomes.6 Nonsurgical treatment is the current first-line approach; options include sclerotherapy, percutaneous drainage and ablation, corticosteroids, and sildenafil.7-10The patient’s eyelid swelling resolved within a few days, and she was monitored periodically with orbital ultrasonography. The orbital mass significantly decreased in size with time, and it was decided to defer tissue biopsy or invasive procedures.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most appropriate next step is to observe the patient (option B). 

The clinical case describes a 2-year-old girl with left upper eyelid swelling that developed shortly after a viral illness. The MRI findings reveal a left intraconal mass with specific signal characteristics on T1 and T2-weighted images. These features are highly suggestive of an orbital hematoma, likely a subperiosteal hematoma.

Orbital hematomas can occur spontaneously or following minor trauma, and in this case, it may have been precipitated by the vomiting episode during the viral illness. The MRI findings of a hypointense mass with a hyperintense rim on T2-weighted images are typical for a hematoma.

In the absence of vision-threatening complications such as optic nerve compression or significant proptosis, and given the patient's stable clinical condition (no fever, normal pupillary responses, full ocular movements), observation is the most appropriate management strategy. Orbital hematomas often resolve spontaneously over time without intervention.

Options A (chemotherapy and radiotherapy) and D (biopsy) are too aggressive and not indicated for a likely benign, self-resolving condition. Option C (CT scan) is unnecessary as the MRI has already provided detailed imaging of the orbits.

Observation allows for monitoring of the patient's condition while avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures or treatments.

Other features of this case consistent with CCF included raised IOP (due to increased episcleral venous pressure), conjunctival chemosis, and visual blurring. Significant visual loss may occur secondary to traumatic, ischemic, or glaucomatous optic neuropathy.In 75% of CCF cases there is a direct connection between the intracavernous segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the cavernous sinus, usually due to arterial wall trauma after head injury.3 Acute high-flow symptoms of direct CCFs (commonly used terms) include visual blurring, motility disorders, proptosis, chemosis, and orbital bruits.In the remaining 25% of cases, the cavernous sinus communicates with 1 or more meningeal branches of the ICA, external carotid artery, or both. Indirect CCFs (also known as dural CCFs) present with chronic low-flow symptoms, including raised IOP, conjunctival engorgement, and chemosis. Associated systemic conditions, which careful investigation may detect, include venous thrombosis, hypertension, fibromuscular dysplasia, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, and dissection of the ICA.When CCF is suspected clinically, the patient’s condition should be discussed urgently with interventional neuroradiology and/or neurosurgery specialists regarding appropriate investigations, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance angiography and catheter cerebral angiography (choice C).1 This patient’s CT intracranial angiographic image revealed a prominent left cavernous sinus and arterial enhancement of the sinus and left superior ophthalmic vein, consistent with CCF. Figure 2 shows a subsequent digital subtraction angiographic image.Digital subtraction angiographic image after transfemoral catheterization. A left-sided dural carotid-cavernous fistula is noted, with supply from both the external and internal carotid artery branches, with cortical venous drainage and retrograde filling of the left superior ophthalmic vein.In the absence of high-risk features, such as vision loss or cortical venous drainage, conservative options may be appropriate, including close observation (70% of dural CCFs close spontaneously). Manual intermittent compression of the ipsilateral cervical carotid artery by the patient’s contralateral hand is successful in 35% of cases but is contraindicated because of the risk of stroke when carotid atherosclerotic disease exists.1Definitive surgical intervention aims to completely occlude the fistula while maintaining flow within the ICA.4,5 Endovascular approaches (usually transvenous via the inferior petrosal sinus, but occasionally via the transorbital intraarterial route) use coils or, less commonly, detachable balloons or liquid embolic agents. These approaches successfully occlude the fistula in 90% to 100% of cases, with a mortality rate of less than 1% and a low rate of major complications (notably, cerebral ischemic event, hemiparesis, and permanent ocular motor nerve palsy).1 Open surgical approaches may be adopted if endovascular intervention fails.Choice A (supportive strategies) was based on an incorrectly assumed diagnosis of nonspecific (potentially allergic) conjunctivitis, choice B (prescription of an NSAID and/or immunosuppression), on a diagnosis of scleritis; and choice D (examination to identify a port-wine stain and/or a choroidal hemangioma), on the suspicion of Sturge-Weber syndrome (given the dilated blood vessels, headache, and raised IOP). Sturge-Weber syndrome is one of the phakomatoses, which may feature port-wine stain, seizures, headaches, choroidal hemangioma, and both dilated bulbar vessels and raised IOP or glaucoma (resulting from raised episcleral venous pressure). All 3 differential diagnoses merit consideration, but investigation to exclude or identify CCF must be prioritized because early treatment may avoid substantial morbidity.Carotid-cavernous fistula should be considered in all cases of persistent red eye, arterialized conjunctival vessels, or chemosis. When clinical suspicion exists, liaising with interventional neuroradiology and/or neurosurgery specialists regarding appropriate urgent neuroimaging, including CT/magnetic resonance angiography or catheter cerebral angiography, should ensure prompt diagnosis and intervention.This patient underwent successful transvenous coil embolization.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to refer the patient for urgent neuroimaging. This decision is based on several key factors in the clinical presentation that strongly suggest a possible carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF):

1. Progressive eye redness and discomfort unresponsive to initial treatments
2. Raised intraocular pressure (IOP)
3. Visual blurring and eyelid swelling
4. Dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels
5. Left-sided dull headache for 2 months
6. ""Whooshing"" noise in the left ear (pulsatile tinnitus)

These symptoms, particularly the combination of eye redness, raised IOP, dilated blood vessels, and pulsatile tinnitus, are classic signs of a CCF. A CCF is an abnormal communication between the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus, which can lead to various ocular and neurological symptoms.

Urgent neuroimaging, such as CT angiography or MRI with contrast, is crucial to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the fistula. Early diagnosis and treatment of CCF are essential to prevent potential complications, including vision loss, intracranial hemorrhage, or stroke.

The other options (B, C, and D) do not address the underlying vascular issue and could potentially delay proper diagnosis and treatment. Supportive strategies, topical treatments, or systemic immunosuppression would be ineffective for a CCF and might mask the progression of the condition.

Ordering orbital magnetic resonance imaging would be a better choice than computed tomography (choice B) because of radiation concerns in a child. Referring the patient for an orbital biopsy (choice D) would be appropriate but could delay treatment in a potentially life-threatening lesion. An abdominal examination (choice C) detected a mass and immediately directed subsequent diagnostic testing and treatment because of the high probability of a metastatic neuroblastoma.The patient was directly admitted to the pediatric oncology service of the university-affiliated children’s hospital, and a systemic workup found moderate anemia, an elevated serum homovanillic acid level, a left suprarenal retroperitoneal mass, osseous and dural metastases, and a left orbital mass. The retroperitoneal mass and bone marrow were biopsied, and frozen sections showed Homer Wright rosettes and small blue cells consistent with neuroblastoma (Figure 2). The tumor was determined to be stage IV, and chemotherapy was instituted with topotecan and cyclophosphamide.Microscopic section of the neuroblastoma demonstrating the formation of Homer Wright rosettes (arrowhead) and small blue cells (hematoxylin-eosin, magnification ×40).Neuroblastomas are the most common cancers in babies and the third most common in children, with the median age at diagnosis 19.1 months.2 Approximately two-thirds of these tumors originate in the abdomen, with 50% beginning in the adrenal gland. Most are sporadic, with less than 2% having a family history. Only 8% of neuroblastomas present with orbital involvement, and most of these (73%) have some form of periorbital ecchymosis, followed by proptosis (54%), periorbital edema (45%), subconjunctival hemorrhage (18%), and vision loss (18%).3Risk stratification systems distinguish low- and intermediate-risk neuroblastomas, which have favorable survival outcomes, from high-risk cases with low rates of survival.4 Treatment options for non–high-risk neuroblastomas include observation, surgical resection, and chemotherapy. Some small tumors spontaneously regress. In contrast, reported survival rates for high-risk neuroblastomas are typically under 50%. Treatment strategies for high-risk disease include chemotherapy, myeloablative therapy with autologous stem cell rescue, radiotherapy, and surgical resection. Genetic studies of neuroblastomas have identified multiple potentially pathogenic biological markers, including MYCN (NCBI Entrez Gene 4613), whose amplification is associated with a poor prognosis.5 Multiple trials have shown success with monoclonal antibodies targeting ganglioside GD2, including dinutuximab, which is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for high-risk neuroblastomas.6,7This patient presented to several outside ophthalmologists with recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhage, but the possibility of an orbital mass was not considered because of a lack of proptosis or other ocular abnormalities. In this case the subconjunctival hemorrhage may be an analogous sign to the classic “raccoon eye ecchymosis” usually associated with the presentation of childhood neuroblastoma. Therefore, this represents a unique presentation of a deadly condition that can be first identified in the ophthalmologist’s practice.",Ophthalmology,2020-11-01,2020,11,"A well-appearing 14-month-old girl was referred for the evaluation of recurrent left subconjunctival hemorrhage with increasing frequency since 7 months of age.

She had a 25-year history of bulimia and was purging almost daily. She reported an inability to go more than 3 days at a time without purging and noted a reduction in the pressure and size of her lesions with respite from these daily episodes. She had no history of eye surgery, hypertension, atherosclerotic disease, or other risk factors for vascular disease.

On examination, the lesions were slightly smaller compared with previous findings on imaging. Although the differential diagnosis includes capillary hemangioma, arteriovenous hemangioma, and lymphangioma, the patient was clinically diagnosed with bilateral bulimia-induced varices of the palpebral arcades. We recommended observation, given her inability to stop purging, to address the origin of disease.Sclerotherapy (choice A) is not the recommended next step because it is typically used for the treatment of orbital low-flow lymphovenous malformations, but it has not been studied for use in varicosities of the peripheral arcade.1 Moreover, sclerotherapy of orbital or facial lesions carries the risk of hemorrhage or embolic events in some cases.2,3 Surgical excision (choice B) is not preferred because the patient’s daily purging should be under better control before surgery is performed. Daily episodes of purging could result in postoperative preseptal or retrobulbar hemorrhage with significant risk of vision loss as well as recurrent varices. Systemic propranolol (choice C) is typically used as first-line treatment of capillary hemangiomas, with response rates reported as high as 60%.4 Its use in the treatment of peripheral arcade varices has not been reported. Moreover, the use of propranolol in a patient who is actively purging could exacerbate bulimia-associated physiological instability.5The most common ocular finding associated with self-induced vomiting is benign subconjunctival hemorrhages that subside with cessation of the behavior. Reports of gastroesophageal varices in patients with binging and purging disorders have also been published.6 Eyelid and conjunctival varices not associated with bulimia are rare and can manifest as positional, palpable masses or remain asymptomatic. Although a varix can describe any abnormally distended vessel, the venous system is commonly affected because of its passive nature and increased pressure causing damage to valves and reflux. Orbital varices are well described in the literature; however, varices of the eyelid and conjunctiva are less common.7,8 Margo et al9 reported a patient with bilateral thrombosed conjunctival varices who underwent surgical excision. Neiberg10 reported a patient with a unilateral eyelid venous malformation for whom small sections were ligated. These authors attribute the manifestation of the lesions to increased venous pressure and decreased venous outflow exacerbated by frequent inverted posture and Valsalva maneuvers, respectively.9,10 These case reports support the efficacy of surgical excision for eyelid and conjunctival varices without chronic daily purging. It is possible that varices developed in these locations secondary to acquired vessel wall weakness in the context of repeated, purging-induced outflow obstruction of the jugular veins. This patient was unable to stop purging at the time of her presentation and was not at high risk for vision loss. We determined that there was minimal risk to observation given the longstanding nature of the lesions. We believe ophthalmologists should be aware of this ocular finding in patients with uncontrolled bulimia and refer them for psychiatric treatment before surgical excision is considered.The lesions might improve if the patient stops purging; however, if the varices persist or worsen, the patient may be a candidate for surgical excision. Because the patient reported ongoing purging, there was concern about the risk for postoperative preseptal or retrobulbar hemorrhage as well as recurrent varices if surgical intervention were chosen as the primary solution. The patient was counseled about the potential consequences that could result in pain, orbital involvement, or vision loss. The patient was advised to continue treatment of her eating disorder and return to the clinic for further management once her eating disorder was better controlled.",Ophthalmology,2020-10-01,2020,10,"A 50-year-old woman was referred to the oculoplastic clinic for evaluation of bilateral vascular lesions of the eye visible beneath the palpebral conjunctivae on the upper and lower eyelids.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate course of action in this case is to observe the periocular lesions while continuing psychiatric treatment for the patient's bulimia. This decision is based on several key factors:

1. Correlation with bulimia: The patient's vascular lesions appear to be directly related to her long-standing history of bulimia. She reports a 25-year history of the eating disorder and notes that the size and pressure of the lesions reduce when she abstains from purging.

2. Non-invasive approach: Given that the lesions are not causing vision changes or pain, and only a sensation of pressure that is relieved when prone, an invasive treatment like surgical excision or sclerotherapy is not immediately necessary.

3. Addressing the root cause: The patient's bulimia is likely the underlying cause of these vascular lesions. Treating the eating disorder through psychiatric intervention may lead to improvement or resolution of the ocular symptoms without the need for direct intervention on the lesions.

4. Low risk of complications: Observation carries the lowest risk of complications compared to surgical or medical interventions, especially when the lesions are not causing significant functional impairment.

5. Potential for natural improvement: If the patient can reduce or cease her purging behavior through psychiatric treatment, the vascular lesions may improve on their own, as evidenced by her report of reduced size and pressure during periods of abstinence from purging.

6. Lack of other risk factors: The patient has no history of hypertension, atherosclerotic disease, or other risk factors for vascular disease, suggesting that the lesions are likely related to her bulimia rather than other underlying conditions that might require immediate intervention.

By observing the lesions while focusing on psychiatric treatment for bulimia, we address the root cause of the problem while avoiding unnecessary risks associated with more invasive treatments. This approach allows for reassessment of the lesions over time and the possibility of resolution or improvement without direct intervention.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

1352,454,457,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2770553,92020,"A 62-year-old woman with a history of chronic angle-closure glaucoma and bilateral peripheral iridotomies sought a second opinion for worsening visual acuity in the left eye for 2 months. She had been treated for glaucoma for approximately 1 year. Review of systems was negative for previous episodes of eye pain, redness, or emesis. Her medical history included hyperlipidemia, obesity, and prior cataract surgery in both eyes. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/80 OS. The patient’s pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure was 11 mm Hg bilaterally without medication. Slitlamp findings were notable for patent peripheral iridotomies, open angles on gonioscopy, and an asymmetrically enlarged cup-disc ratio with mild pallor of the left optic nerve. Color vision was decreased in the left eye. Visual field (VF) testing as well as ganglion cell layer (GCL) segmentation by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were obtained for both eyes (Figure 1).Optical coherence tomography ganglion cell layer thickness map shows nasal thinning of the right eye (A) and diffuse thinning of the left eye (B). In the right eye, the relative thinning within the nasal macula compared with the temporal macula suggests injury to the papillomacular bundle. In the left eye, the diffuse thinning suggests diffuse optic nerve injury (Heidelberg Spectralis; Heidelberg). Insets show Humphrey 24-2 perimetry with minimal nonspecific defects in the right eye and a temporal scotoma in the left eye.Refer to a retina specialist owing to retinal thinningStart intraocular pressure–lowering medications owing to GCL loss What Would You Do Next?",Refer to a retina specialist owing to retinal thinning,Start intraocular pressure–lowering medications owing to GCL loss,Order a carotid doppler,Order brain magnetic resonance imaging,Nonglaucomatous optic neuropathy secondary to a pituitary adenoma,D,Order brain magnetic resonance imaging,"Optic chiasm compression from a pituitary adenoma classically produces bitemporal vision loss. Most adenomas are nonfunctional or prolactinomas.1,2 Adenomas causing 3 mm or more of chiasm displacement are associated with VF defects and initially compress inferior nerve fibers leading to superior VF defects.3 Diagnosis is confirmed after tumor resection and pathologic analysis. In a 2019 study, most patients undergoing resection presented with vision loss (61.7%), followed by headache (40.0%) or endocrine dysfunction (21.8%).1Optic neuropathies are associated with loss of retinal ganglion cells and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) axons. Nasal retinal nerve fibers decussate at the optic chiasm, supplying the temporal visual hemifield. The papillomacular bundle describes the central macular retinal nerve fibers, which lie just temporal to the optic nerve; these fibers are typically not affected in glaucoma. Topographically, papillomacular bundle injury would demonstrate nasal thinning on macular GCL OCT segmentation and temporal thinning on circumpapillary RNFL OCT scans.4 The distribution of nasal retinal nerve fibers also explains the bow tie optic nerve pallor associated with compressive chiasmal lesions.4,5 Other findings may include relative afferent pupillary defect, dyschromatopsia, and bitemporal hemianopsia. However, most patients do not present with complete bitemporal hemianopsia, and, therefore, chiasmal lesions must be suspected in cases of incomplete temporal field defects or those crossing the vertical midline due to extrachiasmal extension.3 In a 2018 study, OCT GCL and RNFL analyses were able to detect chiasmal lesions significantly earlier than by clinical examination or VF testing.6 Greater preoperative RNFL/GCL thicknesses are associated with better visual recovery after tumor resection.4 Tumor recurrence is monitored at least yearly with neuroimaging and VF testing.2The diagnostic key in this case is to identify that the left temporal scotoma respects the vertical meridian. Such VF defects result from lesions at or posterior to the optic chiasm, while horizontal field defects typically have intraocular causes such as retinal pathologies (choice A). For example, branch retinal artery occlusions, possibly due to emboli, would feature horizontal VF deficits and inner retinal atrophy (choice C). For cases of early or nonspecific VF defects, nasal GCL thinning is extremely suggestive of nonglaucomatous optic neuropathy rather than glaucoma; the latter typically starts with superotemporal or inferotemporal GCL thinning (choice B).4 Despite the absence of a classic bitemporal hemianopsia, optic chiasm pathology was suspected given the nasal GCL thinning observed in the right eye.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to order brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here's why:

1. Asymmetric presentation: The patient has worsening visual acuity in the left eye (20/80) compared to the right eye (20/20), along with asymmetric optic nerve findings (enlarged cup-disc ratio and mild pallor in the left eye).

2. Normal intraocular pressure: The patient's intraocular pressure is 11 mm Hg bilaterally without medication, which is within normal limits. This makes glaucoma progression less likely as the cause of her symptoms.

3. OCT findings: The OCT shows diffuse thinning of the ganglion cell layer in the left eye, suggesting diffuse optic nerve injury. This pattern is not typical for glaucoma, which usually shows more localized thinning.

4. Visual field results: The left eye shows a temporal scotoma, which is consistent with a nasal visual field defect. This pattern is suggestive of a compressive lesion affecting the optic chiasm or optic nerve.

5. Chronic angle-closure glaucoma history: While the patient has a history of glaucoma, her current presentation and findings are not consistent with typical glaucoma progression, especially given the normal intraocular pressure and asymmetric presentation.

Given these findings, there is a high suspicion for a compressive lesion affecting the left optic nerve or optic chiasm. Brain MRI would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate for potential causes such as a pituitary adenoma, meningioma, or other intracranial masses that could be causing the observed symptoms and clinical findings.

Starting intraocular pressure-lowering medications (option D) is not appropriate given the normal current pressures. Referring to a retina specialist (option C) is not indicated as the primary issue appears to be related to the optic nerve rather than the retina. A carotid doppler (option A) would not be the first choice given the presentation is more suggestive of a compressive optic neuropathy rather than vascular etiology.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

The bilateral cicatrizing disease prompted workup for other underlying conditions, such as vitamin A deficiency and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP). Brimonidine-timolol drops were discontinued because medicamentosa is a common cause of cicatrizing disease.1 Discontinuation of the offending medication is often diagnostic; however, the severity of the keratinization and the bilaterality (brimonidine-timolol drops were used only unilaterally) suggested that medicamentosa alone was not the culprit (choice C). Furthermore, these features were concerning for an underlying life-threatening cicatricial process, such as mucous membrane pemphigoid, making observation inappropriate (choice A).2 It would likewise be inappropriate to perform lesion excision with tissue disposal (choice D). Vitamin A levels returned as normal, and the patient’s medical history did not suggest a nutritional deficiency or malabsorption.After the patient’s initial visit, a biopsy was performed in the area of keratinization inferiorly. The biopsy demonstrated a thickened epithelium with a significant layer of hyperkeratosis and a distinct granular layer. Two independent specimens sent to a dermatopathology laboratory were negative for OCP and did not identify immune deposits using conjugates specific for immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, IgM, complement C3, and fibrin. Four months after initial presentation, the superior pannus appeared to be worsening, with increasing vessel engorgement and neovascular fronds progressing onto the cornea. Another biopsy of this area revealed conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia.Causes of conjunctival cicatrization and symblepharon include OCP, thermal and chemical burns, postinfectious conjunctivitis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.3 Although results of direct immunofluorescence were negative in this case, only 20% to 67% of OCP cases are positive by this test, and the bilateral nature of the case reinforced suspicion for a systemic process.1Cicatrizing disease and OSSN may be related via local immune dysfunction. For example, OCP activates autoantibodies against basement membrane antigens, which stimulates the complement cascade, a propagator of chronic inflammation.2 This long-term inflammation may result in oncogenesis. Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid has not been associated with a higher frequency of other autoimmune disorders.4 Systemic treatment is required to inhibit the progression of disease in most cases of autoimmune cicatrizing disease.5 Ocular surface squamous neoplasia in the context of autoimmune disease can pose a challenge with regard to management, as the immunosuppression from systemic treatment may predispose the patient to develop subsequent OSSN lesions.Initial treatment of OSSN is typically topical chemotherapeutic agents, which can treat the entire ocular surface without the need for surgical intervention. Interferon alfa-2b has antiproliferative and cytotoxic properties, with an efficacy rate between 80% and 100%.6 Similarly, more than 80% of OSSN cases respond completely to fluorouracil treatment.7 Finally, the antimetabolite mitomycin C has efficacy rates from 76% to 100% but has higher rates of ocular surface toxic effects compared with the alternatives.7 A surgical approach with a no-touch technique can be used to excise OSSN with margins of at least 3 to 4 mm of uninvolved conjunctiva.8This patient was treated with topical and subconjunctival injections of interferon alfa-2b, resulting in complete resolution of the OSSN within 2 months (Figure 2). The decision was made to closely monitor the patient for cicatricial disease progression in lieu of initiating treatment owing to the significant improvement with current therapy.After 2 months of treatment with topical and subconjunctival interferon alfa-2b, the superior neovascular fronds demonstrated in Figure 1B had resolved.",Ophthalmology,2020-08-01,2020,8,"A woman in her 60s with a history of hypothyroidism presented with a 6-month history of progressive, diffuse redness and tearing in the left eye.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to test for vitamin A deficiency and perform conjunctival biopsies for pathologic evaluation and testing for immune deposits.

The patient presents with a complex ocular condition characterized by progressive, diffuse redness and tearing in the left eye, extensive keratinization of the conjunctiva, neovascular fronds at the limbus, and fornix shortening. These symptoms and signs are suggestive of a serious ocular surface disorder, which requires further investigation to determine the underlying cause and guide appropriate treatment.

Testing for vitamin A deficiency is crucial because vitamin A plays a vital role in maintaining the health of the ocular surface. Although the patient denies a history of malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency can occur due to various reasons, including malabsorption syndromes or certain medications. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to conjunctival and corneal xerosis, which could explain some of the patient's symptoms.

Conjunctival biopsies for pathologic evaluation and testing for immune deposits are essential to rule out other potential causes of the ocular surface changes, such as ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or other autoimmune conditions. These tests can provide valuable information about the underlying pathology and guide further management.

Option A (observing after stopping brimonidine-timolol) is insufficient, as it doesn't address the underlying cause of the condition. Option C (starting artificial tears) may provide some symptomatic relief but doesn't investigate the root cause. Option D (extensive excision and reconstruction) is too aggressive at this stage without a clear diagnosis and understanding of the underlying pathology.

Plants in the Asclepiadaceae family are known to contain cardiac glycosides in their latex, leaves, stems, and roots. Cardiac glycosides can inhibit the Na+-K+-ATPase enzyme found in the corneal endothelium and are able to penetrate the cornea with minimal injury to the corneal epithelium.1 Two previous cases have described isolated endothelial decompensation and stromal edema after exposure to the milky latex of Asclepias curassavica2 and Asclepias fruticose.3Onset of symptoms on exposure to the corneal toxin from these plants can begin within 12 hours. However, the effect of cardiac glycosides on the corneal endothelium can be self-limited, with corneal endothelial cell dysfunction lasting only 24 to 48 hours. This was seen in the case of A curassavica contact,2 which was treated only with topical lubrication. Treatment with topical corticosteroid therapy can serve to reduce ocular inflammation but can also increase Na+-K+-ATPase pump activity in corneal endothelial cell receptors not affected by the cardiac glycoside, to compensate for reduced endothelial cell activity.4 In the case of A fruticose corneal toxicity,3 complete resolution was seen within 3 days of initiation of corticosteroid therapy.In this case, topical prednisolone acetate, 1%, was administered every 2 hours (choice B) and a sodium chloride hypertonicity ophthalmic solution, 5%, was administered 4 times a day. Improvement in the corneal edema was seen within 2 days of treatment (Figure 2), and it had completely resolved by day 5, with improvement in visual acuity to 20/30 in the affected eye and a decrease in corneal pachymetry to 612 μm. Her vitreous hemorrhage had also resolved at this time. Topical steroid therapy was tapered over the course of the following week, and the topical sodium chloride solution was discontinued. The patient had no recurrence of corneal edema in 7 months of follow-up.Corneal edema can also be caused by viral processes, such as the herpes simplex virus, and can be treated with oral and/or topical antiviral treatment. However, this patient did not have any additional examination findings, such as dendrites or keratouveitis, or a recent illness that would suggest a viral causative mechanism, and therefore no antiviral therapy (choice C) was initiated.5 Endothelial keratoplasty (choice D) and penetrating keratoplasty would ultimately be reasonable options if irreversible endothelial and/or full-thickness corneal dysfunction was observed despite maximal medical therapy. This patient’s corneal edema resolved completely, and an endothelial keratoplasty was not required. In addition, there was also no corneal neovascularization that warranted use of intrastromal injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent (choice A).In conclusion, corneal toxicity secondary to Asclepias plant exposure, while uncommon, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with isolated corneal edema.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to start topical corticosteroid eyedrops (Option A).

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are consistent with acute toxic keratopathy, likely caused by exposure to plant latex. The key features supporting this diagnosis are:

1. Acute onset of symptoms (redness, irritation, and blurred vision) in the left eye
2. Recent history of eye rubbing after handling plant latex
3. Corneal findings: pinpoint epithelial defects, thickened stroma, and dense Descemet folds
4. Increased corneal thickness (706 μm compared to the normal 540-560 μm)

Toxic keratopathy can result from exposure to various chemical agents, including plant latex. The corneal edema and epithelial defects are indicative of an acute inflammatory response to the toxic substance.

Topical corticosteroid eyedrops are the most appropriate initial treatment for this condition because:

1. They help reduce inflammation and corneal edema
2. They can alleviate symptoms such as redness and irritation
3. They promote healing of the corneal epithelium

The other options are less suitable for this case:

B. Endothelial keratoplasty is not indicated as the primary treatment for acute toxic keratopathy.
C. Antiviral medications are not appropriate as there is no evidence of viral infection.
D. Intrastromal anti-VEGF injection is not indicated for toxic keratopathy and is more commonly used for corneal neovascularization.

Starting topical corticosteroid eyedrops will help manage the acute inflammatory response and promote healing of the corneal epithelium, addressing the patient's immediate symptoms and potentially preventing further complications.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

A woman in her 60s with a history of bilateral proliferative diabetic retinopathy complicated by a recent vitreous hemorrhage in her left eye presented with an acute onset of redness, irritation, and blurred vision in her left eye. Her symptoms started 1 day after she rubbed her left eye with her hands after handling the milky latex (a fluid found in 10% of flowering plants) of a plant in her garden. She had no recent history of recent eye surgery, eye trauma, cold sores, or new illnesses.On presentation, her visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/200 OS. Her pupils were equal, round, and reactive in both eyes. Her intraocular pressures were 16 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. On anterior segment examination, she was found to have pinpoint epithelial defects, thickened stroma, and dense Descemet folds, along with a nuclear sclerotic cataract (Figure 1). Central pachymetry in the left eye measured 706 μm, which was elevated from the mean expected pachymetry values of 540 to 560 μm. A posterior pole examination was limited by corneal edema, but there was evidence of a vitreous hemorrhage. The fellow eye had no corneal edema and was pseudophakic, with prior panretinal photocoagulation scars in the peripheral retina.

An edrophonium test (choice A) aids in diagnosing myasthenia gravis, while sumatriptan injections (choice D) can treat cluster headache. Although myasthenia gravis and cluster headache may present with acute ptosis, a patient with this constellation of symptoms must first be evaluated for life-threatening causative mechanisms. Myasthenia gravis typically does not present with a headache and anisocoria, while new migraines1 or cluster headaches2 in a 56-year-old patient are atypical. Lastly, a diagnosis of blepharoptosis and referral for surgical repair (choice B) should be made only after more lethal diagnoses have been excluded.This patient with ipsilateral ptosis and miosis prompted the diagnosis of a left-sided Horner syndrome. Horner syndrome, particularly with facial pain and hypertension, must raise suspicion for carotid dissection.3 An MRA of the head and neck was performed, demonstrating a 12-mm dissection of the left internal carotid artery in the high cervical portion of the neck (Figure 2). An intramural hematoma with severe narrowing of the true lumen was present.Magnetic resonance imaging and 3-dimensional reconstruction of the internal carotid arteries, showing severe narrowing of the left internal carotid artery in the high cervical region (arrowhead).The sympathetic innervation of the head and neck consists of a 3-order system.4 Disruption of the first-order neuron, which runs from the hypothalamus to the cervical spinal cord, occurs secondary to causative mechanisms that include stroke, malignant conditions, and demyelinating lesions. The second-order neuron runs from the spinal cord through the brachial plexus to the superior cervical ganglion. Lesions affecting the thoracic outlet, mediastinum, pulmonary apex, and neck cause second-order lesions. Lastly, the third-order neuron enters the cranium with the internal carotid artery, traveling through the cavernous sinus into the orbit. Lesions affecting the internal carotid artery, including dissections, trauma to the base of the skull, and cavernous sinus lesions, result in third-order lesions.Topical cocaine, 10%, drops can confirm Horner syndrome by causing dilation of the normal pupil only. Apraclonidine causes dilation of the miotic pupil because of denervation sensitivity. Lastly, hydroxymethamphetamine differentiates third-order lesions from first-order and second-order lesions by causing dilation of the abnormal pupil in first-order and second-order neurons only.5While this patient presented with an unremarkable CT of the head, MRI of the brain, and carotid ultrasonographic image, the absence of an angiogram rendered the previous workup incomplete. Carotid ultrasonography is a poor modality for detecting spontaneous carotid artery dissection in patients with isolated Horner syndrome. In 1 study6 of 88 patients with confirmed spontaneous carotid artery dissection presenting with isolated Horner syndrome, carotid ultrasonography had a false-negative rate of 31%.Both MRI with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and CT angiography are highly sensitive and specific in detecting spontaneous carotid artery dissection. Computed tomography requires radiation and iodinated contrast7 but is faster and may better identify intraluminal thrombi.8 With MRA, the sensitivity of MRI for carotid dissection ranged from 50% to 100% across studies, while CT angiography sensitivity ranged from 64% to 100%.9 Generally, both MRI or MRA and CT angiography are acceptable imaging modalities for the evaluation of carotid dissection. While conventional angiography remains the gold standard test, it is associated with serious complications, including hemorrhage and infection.10The patient was transferred to a nearby tertiary hospital.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) of the brain and neck (Option A).

The patient presents with acute ptosis of the left upper eyelid, which developed after experiencing severe left-sided facial pain. This combination of symptoms, along with the patient's age and history of hypertension, raises suspicion for a possible vascular etiology, particularly carotid artery dissection or aneurysm.

While the initial workup, including CT and MRI, was reported as unremarkable, these studies might not have been optimized to visualize vascular structures. MRA is specifically designed to evaluate blood vessels and can detect abnormalities such as dissections, aneurysms, or other vascular malformations that could explain the patient's symptoms.

The ptosis in this case is likely due to a partial Horner's syndrome (given the smaller pupil on the affected side), which can be caused by a lesion anywhere along the oculosympathetic pathway. A carotid artery dissection is a known cause of Horner's syndrome and can present with pain followed by ptosis.

The other options are less appropriate:
B. Sumatriptan injection is used for migraines and would not address the underlying cause of persistent ptosis.
C. Oculoplastic referral for ptosis repair would be premature without identifying the underlying cause.
D. Edrophonium test is used to diagnose myasthenia gravis, which is less likely given the unilateral presentation and lack of other ocular symptoms.

Therefore, MRA of the brain and neck is the most appropriate next step to further evaluate the potential vascular causes of the patient's symptoms.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Liver function tests (choice A) would not be the preferred answer because this would not help in determining the cause of vision loss, although liver dysfunction may occur in patients with heavy alcohol intake. Disulfiram (choice C) is a medication that leads to adverse effects when combined with alcohol intake and was not recommended because it should only be used in patients abstaining from alcohol use with the goal of maintaining abstinence. Because the process localizes to the optic nerves and neurological examination results were otherwise normal, a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan will likely not give additional information and was not the preferred answer (choice D).Nutritional deficiency is rare in high-income countries, but certain patient populations are at risk.2 These include those with alcoholism, a restricted vegetarian diet, bariatric surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, or psychiatric disorders.3 In people with alcoholism, studies suggest that a direct toxic effect of tobacco and alcohol likely also contributes.2 Patients suspected to have vitamin B12 and folate deficiency should have a complete blood cell count, serum B12, and folate levels assessed. Because tissue stores of vitamin B12 do not always reflect serum levels, functional B12 or folate deficiency can be further assessed with serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid.3 Homocysteine will be elevated in functional folate deficiency, whereas methylmalonic acid will be elevated in functional B12 deficiency. Red blood cell (RBC) folate is a surrogate test for tissue folate levels, as it gives information about folate over the life span of RBCs and may be used if there is a strong suspicion of folate deficiency but normal or borderline low folate levels.4 This patient had a normal hemoglobin level of 14.6 g/dL (normal, 13.0-17.0 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) with an elevated mean corpuscular volume of 105.9 μm3 (normal, 82.0-97.0 μm3; to convert to fluid liters, multiply by 1). Vitamin B12 levels were normal at 190.4 pg/mL (normal 98-465 pg/mL; to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 0.7378), folate levels were low at 4.3 (normal, >15.0), and RBC folate levels were low at 1031 ng/mL (normal, >3342 ng/mL; to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.266). Magnetic resonance imaging results of the brain and orbits with contrast were normal. Genetic testing results for the 3 primary mutations of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy were negative.Treatment for folate-deficiency optic neuropathy involves addressing the underlying issues contributing to this state and vitamin supplementation. Because a direct toxic effect of alcohol and tobacco likely also play a role in vision loss, it is important that patients are promptly referred for appropriate counseling or medical management of these issues. Vitamin supplementation may be administered orally or intravenously for patients with substantial neurological deficits or absorption issues. In terms of isolated folate-deficiency optic neuropathy, previous studies have shown visual improvement when oral folate, 1 to 5 mg, daily, were used.5-7The patient was counseled on reducing alcohol and tobacco use. He enrolled in a rehabilitation program to successfully eliminate his alcohol consumption, was prescribed a B-complex multivitamin containing folic acid, 1 mg, daily, and started eating 3 nutritious meals per day.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to assess serum vitamin B12 and folate levels (Option B). This decision is supported by several key factors in the case:

1. Bilateral vision loss: The patient presents with gradual vision loss in both eyes, which is characteristic of nutritional optic neuropathy, often caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.

2. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of substantial alcohol use (2-3 L of wine per day), which can interfere with the absorption and metabolism of vitamins, particularly B vitamins.

3. Poor nutrition: The patient only eats one meal per day due to excessive alcohol intake, increasing the risk of nutritional deficiencies.

4. Optic nerve changes: The fundus examination reveals bilateral optic nerve hyperemia and blurred margins, which can be consistent with nutritional optic neuropathy.

5. Central scotomas: The visual field testing shows central scotomas in both eyes, a common finding in nutritional optic neuropathy.

6. Exclusion of other causes: The normal neurological examination and lack of relative afferent pupillary defect make other neurological causes less likely.

Assessing vitamin B12 and folate levels is crucial in this case as deficiencies in these vitamins can lead to optic neuropathy, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and clinical findings. Early detection and treatment of these deficiencies can potentially reverse or halt the progression of vision loss.

While other options like liver function tests (A) or brain MRI (C) might be considered in the broader workup, the most immediate and relevant next step is to assess the patient's nutritional status, given the high suspicion of nutritional optic neuropathy. Treatment with disulfiram (D) is not appropriate at this stage, as it is used for alcohol dependence management and does not address the immediate concern of vision loss.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) through a cross section of the affected area (horizontal blue line in A and C) of the right eye (B) and the left eye (D) revealed bilateral subfoveal disruption of the ellipsoid zone and outer nuclear layer. N indicates nasal; T, temporal.Acute macular neuroretinopathy was initially described in a 1975 case series1 of 4 young women presenting with mildly reduced visual acuity, acute-onset paracentral scotomas, and red-brown, wedge-shaped macular lesions on ophthalmoscopy. All 4 women were taking oral contraception. Since then, environmental triggers reported include recent illness (47.5% of cases), oral contraception (35.6%), sympathomimetic substances such as caffeine and ephedrine (7.9%), septic shock (5%), and severe nonocular trauma (5.9%).2 Acute macular neuroretinopathy exhibits sex, race, and age predilections, with young (mean age, 29 years) white women most frequently affected.2 The process can be bilateral (55% of cases) or unilateral (45%), and scotoma is the chief concern in most cases (72.3%).2Diagnosis of AMN is confirmed with ocular imaging, of which near-infrared and SD-OCT imaging are most sensitive.3 Near-infrared imaging classically shows hyporeflective lesions at or near fixation, whereas SD-OCT reveals disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) and hyperreflective disruption of the outer nuclear layer (Figure, D). In most cases (74%), fluorescein angiography findings are normal.2 Underlying vascular abnormality is suspected in AMN,4 and OCT angiography findings of flow voids within the deep capillary plexus and choriocapillaris have been reported.5-7Acute macular neuroretinopathy should be distinguished from a more common OCT variant known as paracentral acute middle maculopathy, the lesions of which are more superficial than those of AMN, exhibiting hyperreflectivity within the inner nuclear layer and sparing of the EZ. Paracentral acute middle maculopathy is now understood to be an imaging finding in retinal vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vascular occlusions, and retinal vasculitis; flow deficits within the superficial capillary plexus have been confirmed by OCT angiography.4,8 Optimization of cardiovascular risk factors should be advised.Individuals with AMN typically maintain visual acuity of 20/40 OU or better, with reduced yet persistent central scotoma. Optical coherence tomography hyperreflectivity fades over weeks to months, usually followed by thinning of the outer nuclear layer and/or EZ attenuation. Although treatment of AMN with corticosteroids has been reported,9 most patients are observed.In the setting of Crohn disease, we suspected an inflammatory cause for the bilateral central vision loss. This patient was prescribed 60 mg of oral prednisone daily; ustekinumab therapy was held. One month later, his uncorrected distance visual acuity improved to 20/25 OU, with subjective improvement of central scotomas. Disruption of the outer nuclear layer on OCT diminished, leaving behind residual EZ attenuation.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate next step would be to order optical coherence tomography (OCT).

The patient presents with bilateral central vision loss and reddened foveal lesions with irregular macular pigmentation on dilated fundus examination. These findings suggest macular involvement, which is best evaluated using OCT.

OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the retina. It can help identify and characterize macular abnormalities, including edema, atrophy, or structural changes that may not be visible on clinical examination alone. In this case, OCT would be particularly useful to:

1. Assess the extent and nature of the macular lesions.
2. Identify any retinal layer disruptions or abnormalities.
3. Detect the presence of subretinal or intraretinal fluid.
4. Provide a baseline for monitoring disease progression or treatment response.

The other options are less appropriate at this stage:

A. Repeat neuroimaging: The patient has already undergone MRI of the orbit and brain, which was unremarkable. There's no immediate indication for repeating this test.

B. Discontinuing immunosuppression therapy: While the patient is on ustekinumab for Crohn's disease, there's no clear evidence that this is causing the ocular symptoms. Discontinuing therapy without further investigation could potentially worsen the patient's underlying condition.

D. Indocyanine green angiography: While this can be useful for evaluating choroidal circulation, OCT would be a more appropriate first-line imaging modality for assessing macular pathology.

Therefore, ordering OCT is the most appropriate next step to further evaluate and characterize the macular lesions causing the patient's central vision loss.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Her Snellen visual acuities were 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Her intraocular pressures were 21 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. The right eye had a relative afferent pupillary defect and mild optic nerve edema. To rule out optic neuritis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain and orbits was obtained; the results were unremarkable. Six days after symptom onset, her visual acuity decreased to 20/70 OD and the disc edema increased. In addition, the right eye had developed 2+ anterior chamber cell, keratic precipitates, and a possible branch vein occlusion. At this time the patient was referred to our clinic. On presentation 1 day later, visual acuity was light perception OD and still 20/20 OS. The right eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell, inferior keratic precipitates, and 1+ vitreous cell. The right optic nerve had grade 4 disc edema with flame-shaped peripapillary hemorrhages. The fundus examination results of the right eye revealed the following superior quadrant retinal findings: extensive intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages along vessels, arteriolar attenuation and sheathing, venous engorgement, and tortuosity. The inferior midperiphery had numerous small areas of deep retinal whitening (Figure 1). Examination results of the left eye were normal.An Optos color photograph of the right eye of a woman in her 40s with grade 4 disc edema and associated flame-shaped peripapillary hemorrhages. Also noted are diffuse intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages in the superior peripheral retina. The retinal arteries are attenuated with box carring throughout the retina. There is extensive vascular sheathing involving predominantly the retinal venules, which are also dilated and tortuous (arrowhead).

Systemic corticosteroids (choice A) or intraocular steroids (choice B) are contraindicated before an appropriate infectious workup has been completed. Intramuscular penicillin G (choice D) would not be administered without further proof of infection, and if the patient had ocular syphilis, the appropriate treatment would be intravenous, not intramuscular, penicillin. The presentation was suspicious for viral retinitis (acute retinal necrosis) and clearly rapidly progressive and vision threatening. Oral valacyclovir was administered empirically (2 g, 3 times daily; choice C); intravitreal antiviral medication was deferred pending the results of aqueous polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The PCR results were positive for varicella-zoster virus, so she received intravenous (IV) acyclovir and intravitreal foscarnet.This is an unusual presentation of acute retinal necrosis (ARN) due to varicella-zoster virus. Acute retinal necrosis typically presents with peripheral patches of retinitis and prominent anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation.1 In contrast, this patient initially had optic disc edema, and then branch retinal artery and vein occlusions and anterior uveitis developed several days later. Seven days after the onset of vision loss, fluorescein angiography results of the right eye demonstrated delayed completion of the venous phase, arterial and venous occlusions predominantly in the superior retina, and blocking from the associated intraretinal hemorrhages (Figure 2). The patches of retinitis were small and nonconfluent in the inferior midperiphery and the vitreitis was low grade. There are previous reports of an occlusive arteritis as the initial manifestation of ARN, but these cases occurred in immunocompromised patients2-4 and are likely variants of progressive outer retinal necrosis, which can present with optic neuritis in about 17% of patients.5 Up to 50% of patients can present with a concomitant optic neuropathy in addition to retinal necrosis,6 but it is difficult to estimate the incidence of patients presenting solely with zoster optic neuropathy. This patient had no substantial medical comorbidities and HIV testing results were negative.A widefield Optos photograph of late–recirculation phase fluorescein angiogram of the right eye of the same patient as in Figure 1. There is blocking of the superior retina because of the overlying hemorrhages (asterisks). There is diffuse hypofluoresence throughout the peripheral retina as a result of capillary nonperfusion and arterial occlusive disease (yellow arrowheads). At the posterior pole, there is a venous occlusion superiorly with leaking from the superior veins as well as mild leakage from the nasal venous system. There is also leakage primarily involving the retinal venules seen diffusely throughout the retina (white arrowhead).Studies have shown that 2 g of oral valacyclovir 3 times daily may be as effective as IV acyclovir for treating ARN.7 According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology’s 2017 Ophthalmic Technology Assessment article on the management of ARN, there is no significant difference between oral and intravenous antiviral therapy in the time to retinitis regression, and the risk of contralateral eye involvement is low with both treatments.1 High-dose oral valacyclovir (2 g, 4 times daily) results in plasma levels that are similar to those of IV acyclovir, but favorable outcomes have also been demonstrated with valacyclovir 3 times per day. Before confirmatory PCR results are available, it is reasonable to initiate empirical ARN treatment with oral antiviral medication rather than more expensive IV formulations.The patient received 5 days of IV acyclovir and 3 days of IV methylprednisolone followed by oral valacyclovir, 1 g, 3 times daily, and prednisone, 60 mg, daily.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to administer intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (2.4 million units). This decision is based on the following medical reasoning:

1. Rapid progression: The patient's condition deteriorated quickly from mild symptoms to severe vision loss in just one week, suggesting an aggressive infectious process.

2. Ocular findings: The presence of anterior chamber inflammation, keratic precipitates, vitritis, and extensive retinal involvement (hemorrhages, vascular changes, and retinal whitening) are consistent with ocular syphilis, a form of neurosyphilis.

3. Optic nerve involvement: The initial presentation of optic nerve edema, which worsened over time, is also consistent with syphilitic optic neuritis.

4. Vascular changes: The described retinal vascular findings, including arteriolar attenuation, venous engorgement, and tortuosity, are typical in ocular syphilis.

5. Standard treatment: Benzathine penicillin G is the gold standard treatment for syphilis, including neurosyphilis and ocular syphilis. The dosage of 2.4 million units intramuscularly is appropriate for this condition.

6. Urgency: Given the rapid vision loss, immediate treatment is crucial to prevent further damage and potentially restore vision.

While other options like corticosteroids or antivirals might be considered in some ocular inflammatory conditions, they would not be appropriate as the first-line treatment in this case without first addressing the likely underlying syphilitic infection. Treating with penicillin is essential to target the causative organism (Treponema pallidum) and prevent further progression of the disease.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

In the left eye, the media were clear, and there were multiple patchy, yellow choroidal lesions with obliteration of the normal choroidal vasculature throughout the entire fundus (Figure 1A). There was no sign of vitritis or retinitis and no history of previous trauma, uveitis, sarcoidosis, or cancer. Ocular ultrasonography revealed diffuse ciliochoroidal thickening measuring 2.9 mm in elevation.

The morphology found on incisional biopsy with immunohistochemistry (Figure 2B) was compatible with mature small B-cell lymphoma, including extranodal marginal-zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), with prominent plasmacytic differentiation or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.Histopathological stain (hematoxylin-eosin; original magnification, ×100) of the conjunctival lesion showed an infiltrate of small plasmacytoid lymphocytes with intranuclear cytoplasmic pseudoinclusions of immunoglobulin (Dutcher bodies; arrowhead), compatible with mature B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation. Inset photograph: relook at the anterior segment in the left eye shows a faint salmon-colored conjunctival lesion (arrowheads) suggesting a lymphoid process.In this case, systemic oncologic evaluation (choice C) uncovered underlying IgM paraproteinemia (IgM paraprotein level, 280 mg/dL; normal range, 45-250 mg/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01) without systemic infiltration elsewhere; IgM paraproteinemia is a monoclonal gammopathy that encompasses a group of disorders in which abnormal proteins (paraproteins) are detected in blood. This uncommon condition affects 3.5% of individuals older than 50 years1 and is a nonspecific hematological phenomenon that accounts for 10% to 20% of all monoclonal gammopathies. The excess of IgM protein usually indicates the presence of underlying hematological conditions, such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, and indolent lymphomas such as MALT.1,2 Elevated serum levels of IgM can result in hyperviscosity syndrome, leading to vascular compromise. Ophthalmic manifestations of monoclonal gammopathies are rare and include immunoglobulin deposition as conjunctival or corneal crystals, choroidal infiltration with secondary subretinal fluid (maculopathy), and tumor formation as uveal plasmacytoma.3-5Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is the most frequent cause of IgM paraproteinemia. However, this patient’s absence of systemic involvement and 2 sequential bone marrow biopsies with negative results make the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and Waldenström macroglobulinemia less likely, because Waldenström macroglobulinemia diagnostically requires bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.1 While monoclonal gammopathy has been regarded as rare in MALT lymphoma, there are recent reports6 documenting an increased incidence of monoclonal gammopathy in this condition. Based on this knowledge, we settled on the diagnosis of MALT lymphoma with secondary IgM paraproteinemia. In addition, DNA molecular data were considered to confirm the diagnosis, but the amount of tissue sample from the conjunctiva was insufficient to perform this analysis.Regarding management, observation of low-grade MALT lymphoma is usually reserved for asymptomatic cases,7 unlike this patient, who noted visual acuity loss. A course of oral prednisone (choice A) would not likely resolve the lymphoid process. Topical administration of interferon (choice B) would not have sufficiently penetrated the choroidal tissue. Rituximab (choice D) was considered, but the lack of systemic findings caused us to explore local therapy. External beam radiotherapy was chosen, and to minimize radiation adverse effects from standard-dose therapy (total, 30-35 Gy), we selected low-dose radiotherapy, also known as boom-boom radiotherapy, a regimen made up of 2 treatments of 2 Gy each (total, 4 Gy).8,9Boom-boom radiotherapy is beneficial in selected cases of lymphoid disease to reduce localized toxicity. This treatment can be effective in the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the orbit and adnexa, with a high overall response rate (96%), durable local control (24 months), minimal adverse effects (30%, including dry eye, conjunctivitis, and transient periorbital edema), and the option of switching to standard-dose radiotherapy for those with relapse.10 Periodic follow-up is warranted for monitoring lymphoma control and treatment adverse effects.",Ophthalmology,2020-05-01,2020,5,"A healthy man in his 60s presented with a 4-month history of blurred vision in his left eye.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to complete serum immunoglobulin level tests, DNA molecular analysis, and bone marrow biopsy (Option D).

The patient's clinical picture strongly suggests a diagnosis of ocular lymphoma, specifically extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (EMZL) or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. This is supported by several key findings:

1. Multiple patchy, yellow choroidal lesions with obliteration of normal choroidal vasculature
2. Diffuse ciliochoroidal thickening on ultrasonography
3. Undulating choroidal infiltration on OCT (""seasick pattern"")
4. Faint conjunctival thickening at the limbus suggestive of lymphoid tumor
5. Incisional biopsy revealing sheetlike infiltration of small monomorphic lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours and Dutcher bodies, which are characteristic of lymphoma

Given these findings, it's crucial to determine the extent of the disease and confirm the diagnosis. Serum immunoglobulin level tests can help identify any paraproteinemia associated with lymphoma. DNA molecular analysis can detect specific genetic abnormalities often found in MALT lymphomas, such as t(11;18) translocation. A bone marrow biopsy is essential to stage the disease and determine if there's systemic involvement.

These tests will provide valuable information for definitive diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. They are necessary before initiating any specific therapy, as the treatment approach may vary depending on whether the lymphoma is localized to the eye or if there's systemic involvement.

The other options (A, B, and C) are less appropriate at this stage:
- Option A (corticosteroids and anti-VEGF therapy) might temporarily reduce inflammation but wouldn't address the underlying lymphoma.
- Option B (topical interferon) is not a standard treatment for ocular lymphoma.
- Option C (rituximab) might be considered as a treatment option, but it's premature to start this without confirming the diagnosis and extent of the disease.

Kidney ultrasonography (choice B) is not recommended, because while metastatic iris tumors can arise from this origin, this patient did not display lesions consistent with metastases. A positron emission tomography scan (choice C) is not preferred because the goal of imaging in this case is to rule out an aortic aneurysm, not identify areas of increased metabolic activity.Iris pigment epithelium (IPE) cysts are thought to arise in utero because of abnormal apposition of the iris epithelial layers.1﻿ Iris flocculi is a term used for multiple, bilateral, congenital IPE cysts at the pupillary margin.2 These cysts can also be found free floating in the aqueous or vitreous gel or can sit relatively immobile in the inferior angle.3 The most common iris location for IPE cysts to occur is peripherally, followed by in the midzonal region and finally centrally.4Pupillary margin IPE cysts can be further divided into unilateral and solitary, or bilateral and multifocal. The unilateral subset is often congenital and benign from a visual perspective. They can be associated with iris melanoma and iris nevus and therefore warrant regular follow-up.5 To our knowledge, there is a lack of reported incidence of iris cysts in the literature, given their often-innocuous nature and the high likelihood of underreporting. However, iris cysts must be differentiated from solid tumors, such as iris or ciliary body melanomas. Ultrasound biomicroscopy remains the gold standard for differentiating iris lesions.6Bilateral IPE cysts frequently collapse spontaneously, then form again to generate iris flocculi. They can occur circumferentially around the pupillary margin, rarely cause any visual disturbance, and often require no intervention.3 When visual compromise does occur, these cysts can be treated with argon laser photocoagulation, fine-needle aspiration with cryotherapy, surgical resection, or Nd:YAG laser cystotomy.7,8 The goal of treatment is to be as minimally invasive as possible. Fine-needle aspiration alone results in high rates of recurrence. Laser treatments are minimally invasive and have excellent visual outcomes. Surgical procedures are invasive and therefore treatments of last resort. However, these procedures have the advantage of obtaining tissue samples for analysis.6Iris flocculi may be associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD). Individuals with an alteration of the ACTA2 gene and/or smooth muscle (MYH11) gene have been found to have abnormal smooth muscle cells in both the iris and the aorta.9 Alterations in ACTA2 are the most common cause of TAAD and encode erroneous actin filaments that impair smooth muscle contraction in the iris sphincter and aorta.10 Loss of smooth muscle in the medial layer of the aortic wall can be seen on histopathological samples of TAAD, which is thought to correspond to the scant amount of smooth muscle seen on light microscopy when looking at iris flocculi samples.9Ophthalmologists should be aware of the potential life-threatening complication of TAAD in patients with iris flocculi and the need for long-term monitoring with computed tomography scans. In fact, Shields and colleagues2 reported a case where a dissecting aortic aneurysm was diagnosed 55 years after diagnosis of iris flocculi.When further history was taken, the patient reported undergoing endovascular stent graft repair for a thoracic aortic dissection about 5 years prior. A computed tomography scan was ordered, which showed a well-placed thoracic stent graft extending from the level of the left subclavian artery to the distal descending thoracic aorta. We performed Nd:YAG laser cystotomy on the left eye to collapse the iris flocculi encroaching on the central visual axis, and this resulted in an improvement in visual symptoms.",Ophthalmology,2020-05-01,2020,5,"A man in his 30s presented for assessment of long-standing iris lesions in both eyes.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to perform a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Multiple iris lesions: The patient presents with multiple brown masses at the pupillary margin in both eyes. These lesions are consistent with iris nodules, which can be a manifestation of various systemic conditions, including neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or, more concerningly, metastatic disease.

2. Progressive visual symptoms: The patient reports progressive visual obscuration in the left eye, which suggests that the condition may be evolving or affecting visual function.

3. Systemic involvement: Given the bilateral nature of the iris lesions and their potential to represent a systemic condition, it's crucial to evaluate for possible involvement of other organ systems.

4. Exclusion of metastatic disease: One of the most important considerations in this case is to rule out metastatic disease, particularly given the multiple lesions and their progression.

A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is the most appropriate next step because:

1. It provides a comprehensive evaluation of major organ systems that could be involved in metastatic disease or systemic conditions associated with iris nodules.

2. It can detect potential primary tumors that might be the source of metastases to the iris.

3. It offers better resolution and detail compared to other imaging modalities for identifying solid organ lesions.

4. It can help in staging if a malignancy is detected and guide further management.

While other options like PET scan or kidney ultrasonography might be considered later, a CT scan is the most appropriate initial step to provide a broad overview of potential systemic involvement.

The name, amyloid, was coined by Virchow in the 1850s based on a botanical term meaning “cellulose,” referencing its fibrillary structure.1 Multiple precursor proteins can form amyloid, which is defined by characteristic beta-pleated sheet protein aggregates that show apple-green birefringence on polarized microscopy. More than 31 precursor proteins have been identified,1 of which the most common are immunoglobulin light chain, serum amyloid A, and transthyretin. Immunoglobulin light chain amyloid accumulates owing to underlying plasma cell dyscrasias, such as Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or multiple myeloma. Serum amyloid A amyloidosis is secondary to chronic inflammatory disease. Transthyretin amyloidosis is hereditary. Amyloid deposits in many organs, including the heart, kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract, brain, skin, and eye, causing organ dysfunction. In patients with systemic light chain amyloidosis, three-quarters involve more than 1 organ.2Ocular and periocular amyloid can manifest as conjunctival masses, orbital masses, cranial neuropathies, gelsolin-type lattice corneal dystrophy, vitreous opacities, chorioretinal lesions, and temporal arteritis.1,3,4 Ocular manifestations vary by subtype of amyloid; the rate of ocular involvement in light chain amyloid has been reported at 11.8%, compared with 20% for transthyretin amyloid and 0% for amyloid A subtype.3,5 Conjunctival amyloidosis accounts for less than 0.002% of all conjunctival lesions.6 It presents as a yellow-pink waxy mass on the bulbar or palpebral conjunctiva. Up to a third of patients have associated blepharoptosis or recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhages.1,4Systemic involvement in conjunctival amyloidosis is uncommon, with an incidence of 12% to 15%.1,4 It has been reported to occur in both light chain and amyloid A subtypes.1,4 Ocular amyloidosis can precede systemic involvement in 7% of patients with light chain amyloidosis.3 Consequently, amyloid subtyping and screening for systemic amyloidosis is recommended. Amyloid subtyping is performed using immunohistochemical stains on tissue samples. Systemic screening tests include complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function testing, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody, β2-microglobulin, N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide, troponin, urinalysis, electrocardiogram, and transthoracic echocardiogram. In light chain amyloidosis, serum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains, and possible skeletal survey are recommended to evaluate for multiple myeloma. In transthyretin amyloidosis, genetic testing is recommended. If further diagnosis is required, abdominal fat pad, rectal mucosal, or bone marrow biopsies may be performed.4,7The best next step after diagnosing periocular amyloidosis is to initiate amyloid subtyping and systemic evaluation (choice C) to identify potentially life-threatening systemic involvement. Treatment of systemic amyloidosis involves treating the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia or inflammatory disease to stop the production of excess protein. For hereditary causes, treatment involves organ transplant.7 In addition, treatment is directed at managing the sequelae of systemic organ involvement. Excision (choice A) and radiotherapy have been described for symptomatic orbital and conjunctival lesions8,9 but should only be attempted once systemic disease has been ruled out. Moreover, 40% to 50% of lesions recur if excised despite treatment with adjunctive cryotherapy.8,10 Cryotherapy treatment (choice B) is used as an adjunct to surgery but should not be performed until systemic disease has been treated. For minimally symptomatic patients with isolated periocular orbital or conjunctival amyloidosis, observation (choice D) is recommended; however, systemic disease must be ruled out first.Amyloid subtyping in this patient revealed λ light chain amyloid. The patient underwent a full workup, results of which did not reveal any evidence of systemic amyloidosis.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate next step would be to order a systemic laboratory workup (Option C).

The patient's biopsy results reveal amyloid deposits, as evidenced by the positive Congo red staining and the characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized microscopy. This finding indicates localized amyloidosis of the eyelid.

While localized amyloidosis can occur in isolation, it's crucial to rule out systemic amyloidosis, which can be associated with serious underlying conditions such as multiple myeloma, other plasma cell dyscrasias, or chronic inflammatory diseases. Systemic amyloidosis can affect multiple organs and can be life-threatening if left undiagnosed and untreated.

A systemic laboratory workup would typically include:
1. Complete blood count
2. Comprehensive metabolic panel
3. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis
4. Free light chain assay
5. Cardiac biomarkers (e.g., NT-proBNP)
6. Thyroid function tests
7. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein

These tests can help determine if the amyloidosis is localized or part of a systemic process, guiding further management and potential referrals to other specialists like hematologists or cardiologists if systemic involvement is detected.

Observation (Option A) alone would be insufficient given the potential for systemic disease. Cryotherapy (Option B) is not typically used for amyloid deposits. Complete excision (Option D) may be considered as a treatment option for localized amyloidosis, but it would be premature to proceed with this before ruling out systemic involvement.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Comprehensive metabolic panel\n3. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis\n4. Free light chain assay\n5. Cardiac biomarkers (e.g., NT-proBNP)\n6. Thyroid function tests\n7. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein\n\nThese tests can help determine if the amyloidosis is localized or part of a systemic process, guiding further management and potential referrals to other specialists like hematologists or cardiologists if systemic involvement is detected.\n\nObservation (Option A) alone would be insufficient given the potential for systemic disease. Cryotherapy (Option B) is not typically used for amyloid deposits. Complete excision (Option D) may be considered as a treatment option for localized amyloidosis, but it would be premature to proceed with this before ruling out systemic involvement."" response_metadata={'id': 'msg_vrtx_0176HAqKCfhy1CiTjzQm3xVq', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 564, 'output_tokens': 391}} id='run-5c5e9b5e-453f-4263-ac0e-b73a7d9fcf06-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 564, 'output_tokens': 391, 'total_tokens': 955}",1.0

Pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy (choice A) is inappropriate without clinical evidence of intraocular infection or malignancy. Secondary stroke prevention (choice B) is not indicated with normal neuroimaging. The examination findings strongly suggest organic rather than functional disease (choice D).Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by accumulation of pathologic misfolded prion protein in the brain. Eighty-five percent of cases are sporadic, 10% to 15% are familial, and the remainder are iatrogenically transmitted through contamination of neurosurgical equipment, human pituitary hormones, or dura mater or corneal grafts.1 The rare Heidenhain variant of sporadic CJD features early and initially isolated visual disturbances caused by occipital cortex degeneration, including cortical blindness, dyschromatopsia, visual distortions, visual field defects, and hallucinations.2 Early isolated ophthalmologic involvement can lead to diagnostic confusion and delayed evaluation by a neurologist.2Gold-standard diagnosis of CJD requires histopathologic confirmation from brain biopsy, but this is typically obtained post mortem.3 Real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) has emerged as a novel, rapid premortem diagnostic assay for CJD that detects the presence of pathologic protease-resistant prion protein in a patient sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or nasal brushings by measuring the fluorescence released from binding of thioflavin T fluorescent dye to the amyloid fibrils that are created when patient pathologic prion protein is mixed with (and induces misfolding and aggregation of) recombinant normal prion protein.4 The RT-QuIC analysis of CSF has been shown to have superior sensitivity (>85%) and specificity (98.5%-100%) to the previously identified CSF biomarkers for CJD, 14-3-3 protein, and tau.5,6 All 3 CSF biomarkers are assayed in the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center prion disease panel (choice C). The RT-QuIC analysis of olfactory epithelial specimens has also shown promise as a less invasive, and perhaps even faster and more accurate, diagnostic assay than CSF analysis.7,8 The updated 2018 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria recognize a positive RT-QuIC result plus neuropsychiatric disorder as sufficient for probable CJD.3 Although CJD is currently incurable, early diagnosis is important for patient and family counseling and supportive care, prevention of iatrogenic transmission,9 and identification of patients who are candidates for clinical trials.This patient’s CSF prion disease panel returned positive for RT-QuIC and 14-3-3 protein and showed elevated total tau protein (more than 3 times the upper limit of normal), with greater than 98% estimated probability of prion disease. Brain positron emission tomography–computed tomography revealed decreased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the frontal and occipital lobes, a pattern consistent with CJD with visual symptoms (Figure 2).10 The patient continued to deteriorate rapidly and died. No autopsy was performed.Representative nonfused axial positron emission tomography–computed tomography brain shows regional hypometabolism of bilateral occipital lobes, left more than right (arrowheads). This was confirmed with 3-dimensional statistical parametric map images (not shown). Additional scans (not shown) showed regional hypometabolism of the bilateral frontal lobes.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and the results of the initial investigations, the most appropriate next step would be to order a cerebrospinal fluid prion disease panel.

The patient's symptoms strongly suggest a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder:

1. Progressive vision loss: The patient has experienced significant vision deterioration over a short period, with visual acuity declining from 20/50 OD and 20/30 OS to hand motion OU in just 9 months.

2. Cognitive decline: The patient's Mini-Mental State Examination score of 6/30 indicates severe cognitive impairment.

3. Gait changes and sensory deficits: These suggest involvement of the central and peripheral nervous systems.

4. Rapid progression: The symptoms have developed over just 3 months, which is consistent with a rapidly progressing condition.

5. Weight loss: Unintentional weight loss is often associated with neurodegenerative disorders.

The combination of visual, cognitive, and motor symptoms, along with their rapid progression, raises suspicion for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a prion disorder. CJD can present with visual disturbances, rapidly progressive dementia, and motor symptoms.

Importantly, the extensive workup performed (MRI, EEG, CSF studies, and various blood tests) has not revealed a clear etiology for the patient's symptoms. This further supports the need to investigate for less common but serious conditions like prion diseases.

The CSF prion disease panel would test for 14-3-3 protein, total tau protein, and RT-QuIC (Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion), which are biomarkers highly sensitive and specific for CJD.

Other options are less appropriate:
B. Vitreous biopsy is invasive and unlikely to yield diagnostic information given the normal fundus examination.
C. Aspirin for stroke prevention is not indicated as there's no evidence of stroke on imaging.
D. Referral for functional vision loss is unlikely given the objective findings and the constellation of neurological symptoms.

Therefore, ordering a CSF prion disease panel is the most appropriate next step in this case.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases. You will be presented with a clinical case and a set of options. Your role is to:

A diagnostic biopsy through a lateral orbitotomy revealed histiocytic cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and enlarged nuclei with lobation of the nuclear membrane (Figure 2). The CD207 immunohistochemical stain was diffusely positive, consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH).Histopathologic findings show histiocytic cells with enlarged, reniform nuclei, with folding of nuclear membranes and eosinophilic cytoplasm (blue arrowheads) in a background of inflammatory cells, predominantly eosinophils (black arrowheads) (hematoxylin-eosin).The differential diagnosis of a sphenoid wing mass in a child includes rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, LCH, metastasis, and infection. Although the external examination results were suggestive of orbital cellulitis, the patient was afebrile and there was no obvious source of infection; thus, intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy (choice B) would be inappropriate. An inflammatory lesion was possible; however, the extent of the process and involvement of the temporal lobe would make the use of IV corticosteroid therapy (choice C) inappropriate. Although a metastatic lesion was possible, a positron emission tomographic scan (choice A) prior to biopsy would not be desirable. Performing a biopsy (choice D) would be essential to determine the diagnosis.Langerhans cell histiocytosis presents in children and adults, with peak ages of 1 to 4 years and 20 to 30 years, respectively.1 Although involvement of bone and bone marrow is most common, other organs can be affected, including the skin, brain, lung, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract.2,3 Unifocal and single-system disease dominates over multisystem disease.1 The skull is the most frequently involved location.2,3 Orbital LCH is rare and more commonly affects pediatric patients.4 The most commonly involved orbital bone is the frontal bone, where there is active hematopoiesis until the second decade of life.4,5 As the frontal sinus develops, the area of active hematopoiesis is displaced laterally, and the lateral orbital roof may be the only periorbital site with active marrow.6,7 Less commonly, the sphenoid bone may be involved.7 Langerhans cells release various cytokines, including prostaglandin E2 and interleukin 1, which stimulate bone resorption and allow the tumor to extend to other areas.6 Consequently, LCH presents as rapidly progressive facial swelling, proptosis, periorbital edema, and localized tenderness.1,2,7A complete history and systemic workup are mandatory to rule out multisystem manifestations of orbital LCH.1 Orbital LCH is responsive to local interventions, such as intralesional corticosteroid injection therapy.6-9 One case series found that 4 of 6 patients with unifocal orbital LCH had complete tumor resolution with intralesional corticosteroid injection therapy and subtotal curettage.6 However, the Histiocyte Society identified orbital LCH as a central nervous system risk site and recommends months of systemic chemotherapy.6,8 Further review of the studies that were the basis of the Histiocyte Society’s recommendations elucidates the difference in management between the ophthalmological and oncological approach. Specifically, 7 of 19 patients with LCH who developed diabetes insipidus had orbital lesions.10 Hence, early investigators concluded that the orbit was a central nervous system risk site for LCH. However, further analysis of this subgroup suggested that all 7 of these patients had multisystem involvement, and none had truly unifocal orbital disease.6,8A positron emission tomographic scan and lumbar puncture were performed, and no other involvement of LCH was identified.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to perform a biopsy of the lesion. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Persistent symptoms: The patient's condition has not improved despite previous antibiotic treatment, suggesting that a simple infection is unlikely.

2. Imaging findings: CT and MRI scans reveal a large destructive lesion in the right sphenoid bone, extending to the orbital apex and involving the right temporal lobe. This extensive, destructive nature of the lesion is concerning for a more serious underlying condition.

3. Lack of definitive diagnosis: Given the unusual presentation and the imaging findings, a specific diagnosis cannot be made without further investigation. A biopsy would provide tissue for histopathological examination, which is crucial for determining the nature of the lesion.

4. Differential diagnosis: The clinical picture could be consistent with various conditions, including neoplasms (benign or malignant), inflammatory processes, or atypical infections. A biopsy is the gold standard for differentiating between these possibilities.

5. Treatment planning: The appropriate treatment cannot be determined without a definitive diagnosis. Different conditions (e.g., tumors, inflammatory disorders, or infections) require vastly different management approaches.

6. Risk assessment: The lesion's proximity to critical structures (orbit, brain) necessitates a precise diagnosis to guide further management and assess the risk of progression.

While other options like antibiotics or corticosteroids might be considered in some cases, they would be premature without a clear diagnosis.

Testing results for anti–glycine receptor (GlyR) and antiamphiphysin antibodies were negative.First described by Whiteley et al,1 PERM represents a more severe clinical spectrum of stiff person spectrum disorder.2 In this patient, PERM can be distinguished from classic stiff person syndrome by prominent brainstem features, including myoclonus, oculomotor disorder, and a disturbance of respiratory rhythm. Her diffuse neurological symptoms, including encephalopathy (altered mental status), autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia and hyperhidrosis), and spinal cord involvement (urinary retention), also fit within the spectrum of PERM.Worsening myoclonus and encephalopathy could be indicative of progressive myoclonic epilepsies (PMEs), which are a group of genetic disorders with an overall poor prognosis. They typically present in late childhood or adolescence and rarely affect adults. Moreover, rapidly progressive presentations over weeks and a lack of epileptiform discharges on EEG made PMEs unlikely in this patient. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures are characterized by repetitive abnormal stereotypic movements that typically affect the ipsilateral face and arm and are associated with leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 antibodies. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease would be consistent with rapidly progressive dementia and myoclonus. Positive assays for neuronal autoantibodies have occasionally been described in CJD but at very low titers of uncertain significance.3 In this patient, the lack of typical MRI abnormalities and absence of periodic sharp wave complexes on EEGs decreased the likelihood of CJD. Real-time quaking-induced conversion test (with 100% specificity for CJD) could be used in cases of diagnostic confusion.Immune-mediated pathomechanisms that target proteins mainly expressed by inhibitory synapses have been associated with stiff person spectrum disorder.4 Autoantibodies that have been identified include GAD65, GlyR, amphiphysin, dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6, gephyrin, γ-aminobutyric acid-A receptor (GABAAR), and GABA receptor associated protein (GABARAP).5 In PERM patients, GlyR antibodies were the most frequent antibodies identified in approximately half of cases, followed by GAD antibodies and rare amphiphysin or dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6 antibodies.2 Notably, there remains a subgroup of seronegative cases. Thus, although positive autoantibody serology results serve as a strong indicator of PERM, it is not a requirement for the diagnosis, which relies on the clinical manifestations plus EMG features.5 The etiology of PERM can be either paraneoplastic or autoimmune mediated.6 Documented malignancy is often associated with amphiphysin antibodies and less frequently with GAD antibodies.7 In this patient, further neoplasia screening results, including positron emission tomography scan and mammogram, were unremarkable. Autoimmune disorders frequently coexist in patients with positive results for GAD antibodies, primarily type 1 diabetes and thyroid disease.8 This patient received a diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis before her first symptoms occurred. Thus, the presence of a concomitant autoimmune condition and GAD antibodies suggests an autoimmune pathomechanism.Management of PERM is focused on immunotherapy, symptomatic treatment, and tumor screening and treatment.9 Prognosis is highly variable among patients; patients with GAD65 antibodies generally had a worse prognosis than patients with GlyR antibodies.5 Continuous monitoring and maintenance therapy are important as PERM typically has high likelihood of relapse and residual disability.Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus may comprise different diseases associated with various immunological features. While laboratory studies support the pathogenicity of GlyR autoantibodies that target cell surface antigens,9 the pathogenicity of GAD antibodies is controversial given that they direct against intracellular synaptic proteins. It is possible that GAD antibodies may mediate a similar transiently exposed antigen effect like amphiphysin antibodies and impair GABAergic inhibition.10The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg/d) for 5 days, intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg/d) for 5 days with an oral prednisone taper, and intravenous diazepam (60 mg/d) for 5 days followed by a taper within 3 weeks. Oral clonazepam (6 mg/d) was used as maintenance therapy. On 6-month follow up, she demonstrated marked improvement with undetectable serum GAD antibodies.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate diagnosis for this case is Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PERM). This conclusion is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Symptom progression: The patient developed worsening spasms in axial and lower limb muscles over a 3-week period, which is consistent with the progressive nature of PERM.

2. Muscle rigidity and spasms: The patient exhibits severe hypertonia and rigidity throughout her trunk and all 4 extremities, along with painful involuntary spasms. These are hallmark features of PERM.

3. Myoclonus: The patient demonstrates marked myoclonus on tactile and acoustic stimulation, which is a defining characteristic of PERM.

4. Autonomic dysfunction: Hyperhidrosis and tachypnea suggest autonomic involvement, which can occur in PERM.

5. Hyperexcitability: Brisk deep tendon reflexes, patella clonus, and extensor plantar responses indicate central nervous system hyperexcitability, typical in PERM.

6. EMG findings: Continuous firing of normal motor unit potentials at rest within the axial and lower limb muscles is consistent with PERM.

7. Associated autoimmune condition: The patient has a recent diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis, and PERM is often associated with autoimmune disorders.

8. Normal brain imaging: The absence of abnormalities on cranial and spinal MRI helps rule out structural causes and is consistent with PERM.

9. CSF findings: Normal protein levels and cell counts, with absent oligoclonal bands, are compatible with PERM.

While the other options have some overlapping features, they do not fully explain the clinical picture. CJD typically progresses more rapidly and would show characteristic EEG changes. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures are typically brief and predominantly affect the face and arm. PMEs usually have a more chronic course and are often associated with cognitive decline and seizures, which are not prominent in this case.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Genetic testing (choice B) could be useful in patients with Fabry disease or other metabolic causes of verticillata, but Fabry disease would be less likely in this context. There is no evidence of an infection or an infiltrate, so initiating corneal scraping and culture (choice C) would not be indicated.Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM) are dyscrasias of plasma cells that result in elevated levels of abnormal monoclonal antibodies in the blood (paraproteinemia). Patients with MGUS are often asymptomatic and may lack signs of pathology on physical examination. Often, the discovery of MGUS in a patient is incidental when a patient has had laboratory work done for another screening. Multiple myeloma and MGUS may appear similar, although the testing for MM usually reveals higher degrees of paraproteinemia and plasma-cell proliferation. Because of the rate of progression from MGUS to MM (approximately 1% per year), patients with MGUS must be monitored closely to detect conversion to MM.1Deposition of immunoglobulins on tissues characterize MGUS and MM in both ocular and nonocular manifestations of the disease. Both conditions have both been found to cause a variety of ocular abnormalities, including crystalline keratopathies,2 corneal verticillata,3 and maculopathies.4 Because of the wide phenotypic array of immunoglobulin deposition in the cornea (paraproteinemic keratopathy), MGUS and MM should be entertained in the differential diagnosis of corneal opacities of unknown origin.Diagnoses of MGUS and MM are most commonly done through bloodwork. Complete blood cell counts and creatinine, electrolyte, and albumin levels are all essential laboratory tests for diagnosing plasma-cell dyscrasias. Blood levels of immunoglobulins will help assess which antibody levels are abnormally high or low. Urine protein electrophoresis, urine immunofixation, and bone marrow biopsies are also performed. Finally, corneal biopsy or anterior chamber paracentesis are alternative approaches to confirm the diagnosis of paraproteinemic keratopathy in a patient with MGUS.5The patient’s laboratory test results revealed an elevated IgG level of 2492 mg/dL (normal range, 600-1800 mg/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01).

[Explanation]
The most appropriate course of action in this case is to provide reassurance to the patient, as he is no longer taking amiodarone. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical case:

1. Amiodarone use: The patient used amiodarone for 6 weeks following his CABG procedure but has not used it for the 10 months prior to presentation. Amiodarone is well-known to cause corneal verticillata, which is typically reversible after discontinuation of the medication.

2. Timing of symptoms: The corneal verticillata was noted after the patient's use of amiodarone, suggesting a causal relationship.

3. Visual acuity: The patient's visual acuity is good (20/20 OD and 20/25 OS), indicating that the corneal changes are not significantly affecting his vision.

4. Lack of other symptoms: The patient denies any other symptoms such as headache, rash, joint pain, or chest pain, which suggests that there are no underlying systemic conditions requiring further investigation.

5. Normal examination findings: Apart from the corneal verticillata and mild nuclear sclerosis, the rest of the ocular examination was within normal limits.

Given that amiodarone-induced corneal verticillata is typically reversible and the patient has already discontinued the medication, the most appropriate action is to reassure the patient. The corneal changes are likely to improve over time without any intervention. There is no indication for additional testing such as laboratory tests for immunoglobulins, genetic testing, or corneal scraping and culture, as these would not provide any additional benefit in managing this condition caused by a known medication side effect.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Despite advances in therapy, mortality rates range from 15% to 85%.1 For this reason, prompt diagnosis and initiation of systemic and local treatment are paramount for optimal outcomes.A high suspicion for ROCM should be triggered by any patient with immunocompromised status presenting with periorbital edema, proptosis, blepharoptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and/or visual acuity decline, especially if it is accompanied by nasal congestion or facial swelling and occurring during the autumn months, when the saprophytic mucormycoses are most active.2,3 A workup for ROCM centers on prompt biopsy with a frozen-section pathology examination. Subsequent treatment rests on the normalization of blood glucose levels, restoration of immunocompetence, systemic antifungal therapy, and debridement of necrotic tissue.4 Reduction in systemic immunosuppression is generally recommended, although its utility in improving outcomes is mixed.4,5 Treatment of orbital involvement occurs on a case-by-case basis.In this case, the available noncontrast imaging may have missed more pronounced orbital involvement. Although contrast imaging may have identified further areas of orbital involvement, obtaining these images (choice A) would not be recommended at this time, given the risks in delaying definitive surgical intervention and subsequent disease progression.6Orbital debridement in the context of known mucormycosis could be considered and discussed with the patient and is a common next step. However, debridement (choice C) was not preferred as the next step, given the low disease burden and apical location of disease on available imaging.The indications for orbital exenteration in the setting of ROCM are controversial. A recent study by Kashkouli et al1 evaluated patients who underwent exenteration after demonstrating progression of disease despite treatment with systemic antifungal agents and debridement of necrotic tissue. The data revealed that orbital exenteration did not affect patient survival, although it was associated with increased time from symptom onset to death. Turner et al7 similarly found no significant association between orbital exenteration and survival. Of note, Hargrove et al8 revealed that exenteration was associated with an increased survival rate if the patient presented with fever. Given the associated morbidity and resulting deformity, exenteration is generally indicated in progressive disease, and it would not be preferred to recommend exenteration at this point (choice D).A less invasive alternative and emerging treatment option (choice B) centers on transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of amphotericin B (TRAMB). A recent case report by Hirabayashi et al9 on this treatment modality demonstrated resolution of infection and excellent visual outcomes. In this case, the procedure was reasonably well tolerated but complicated by transient postprocedural orbital inflammation. In total, per a recent review by Kalin-Hajdu et al,2 6 cases of treatment with TRAMB have been described in the literature, with only the aforementioned case by Hirabayashi et al9 involving Mucorales fungi. One patient developed orbital compartment syndrome after a fifth TRAMB but recovered well after appropriate treatment.10 Treatment with TRAMB may be performed at the bedside or in the operating room following nasosinal debridement.2 Of note, although both liposomal and deoxycholate formulations of amphotericin have been used in TRAMB, systemically, the liposomal formulation is associated with decreased mortality.5Systemic antifungal therapy was initiated. Systemic immunosuppression was reduced. After a detailed discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of exenteration, debridement, and TRAMB, the patient made an informed decision to pursue TRAMB. The patient underwent 2 liposomal TRAMB injections in the operating room following nasosinal debridement. However, the patient continued to deteriorate systemically, despite a modest decrease in sinus fungal involvement on imaging.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform orbital debridement (Option B). Here's the medical explanation for this decision:

1. Acute presentation: The patient has acute-onset visual acuity loss and periorbital pain, suggesting a rapidly progressing condition that requires urgent intervention.

2. Imaging findings: Both CT and MRI show inflammatory changes in the paranasal sinuses and right orbital apex, indicating an invasive process.

3. Biopsy results: The sinus biopsy demonstrated fungal hyphal elements, confirming a fungal infection, likely invasive fungal sinusitis with orbital involvement.

4. Patient's medical history: The patient is immunocompromised due to diabetes and immunosuppression following renal transplant, making him highly susceptible to invasive fungal infections.

5. Severity of symptoms: Complete vision loss (no light perception) in the right eye, along with severe restriction of extraocular movement and ptosis, indicates advanced orbital involvement.

Given these factors, urgent surgical debridement is crucial to remove infected tissue, reduce the fungal load, and prevent further spread of the infection. Delaying intervention (Option D) could lead to progression of the infection and worse outcomes. Transcutaneous retrobulbar injection (Option A) would be insufficient for treating such an extensive infection. Orbital exenteration (Option C) is too aggressive at this stage and should be reserved as a last resort if less invasive measures fail.

The otolaryngology service has already planned urgent surgical nasosinal debridement, which should be extended to include orbital debridement given the clear orbital involvement. This approach, combined with systemic antifungal therapy, offers the best chance of controlling the infection and potentially salvaging orbital structures and function.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

The differential diagnosis included juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG), lymphoma, leukemia, sarcoidosis, HLA-B27–associated uveitis, syphilis, and tuberculosis.Of the options above, a biopsy of the lesion seemed most likely to determine the cause and best future treatment modality (choice A). Administration of a subtenon corticosteroid injection (choice B) may be useful in the treatment of inflammation once a diagnosis is made. An anterior chamber (AC) paracentesis for viral polymerase chain reaction (choice C) is unlikely to be helpful, as one would not expect an infiltrative process in a viral uveitis. Screening for lupus with antinuclear antibody testing (choice D) would not be helpful because the presentation as described is not a manifestation of lupus, nor does lupus cause uvetis. Testing for systemic causes such as HLA-B27, syphilis, tuberculosis, lymphoma, leukemia, and sarcoidosis should also be performed but will be less likely to yield a final diagnosis when compared with biopsy results of involved tissue.Juvenile xanthogranuloma is a rare, benign, non–Langerhans cell histiocytosis seen predominantly in young children. Lesions typically appear as reddish yellow cutaneous nodules around the head and neck within the first year of life.1 These lesions can often resolve spontaneously. Cutaneous lesions arise most frequently, with extracutaneous manifestations mostly affecting the eyes and rarely the brain, liver, lungs, spleen, and other internal organs.2-5Ocular involvement occurs in 0.3% to 10% of cases, with conjunctival hyperemia, iris masses, or iris nodules being the most common ophthalmic manifestations.1,6 Hyphema, heterochromia, iris neovascularization, and masses of the conjunctiva, eyelid, orbit, and choroid are other reported ophthalmic manifestations.1 Lesions are typically limited to the anterior segment and rarely appear posteriorly.1,6 Eye disease associated with JXG is responsive to topical, periocular, and systemic corticosteroid therapy in roughly 66% to 100% of patients and rarely has recurrence once fully treated.2,6 Other options for treatment include excisional biopsy.6 There should be close monitoring until inflammation has been resolved for several months. Afterward, the interval between follow-up appointments can be extended as the inflammation remains inactive.The patient underwent an anterior chamber washout and iris biopsy, which revealed granulomatous inflammation consistent with JXG. Other systemic testing results as mentioned previously were negative. On full review of systems and examination, no systemic manifestations of JXG were noted.The patient was prescribed an extended course of topical corticosteroid therapy with a slow taper. This treatment resulted in resolution of the ocular inflammation and iris infiltrate, with residual iris heterochromia (Figure 2).

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a biopsy of the iris lesion (Option D).

The patient presents with a chronic, unilateral eye condition characterized by recurrent redness, photophobia, and a vascularized iris infiltrate. The condition has persisted for a year and has only shown temporary improvement with topical corticosteroid therapy. The presence of a localized iris lesion, along with ciliary body thickening and a thickened iris pupillary margin, raises suspicion for a possible neoplastic process.

While viral causes and autoimmune conditions are possible, the localized nature of the lesion and its persistence despite treatment make these less likely. Additionally, the negative review of systems and negative tests for tuberculosis and syphilis rule out some systemic causes.

An iris biopsy would provide definitive histopathological diagnosis, which is crucial in this case to rule out malignancies such as iris melanoma or lymphoma. It would also help differentiate between other possibilities like granulomatous inflammation or infectious processes that may not have been detected by initial screening.

Performing a biopsy is more targeted and likely to yield a definitive diagnosis compared to the other options. Viral PCR (Option A) is less likely to be useful given the chronic nature and lack of typical viral symptoms. A subtenon corticosteroid injection (Option B) might provide symptomatic relief but wouldn't address the underlying cause. Screening for antinuclear antibody (Option C) is less specific and wouldn't explain the localized nature of the lesion.

Therefore, an iris biopsy is the most appropriate next step to guide further management and ensure proper treatment for this persistent, localized iris lesion.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Her mother had received cochlear implants for hearing loss, and her maternal grandmother had hearing loss and early-onset diabetes. In addition, 2 of her 3 maternal aunts and uncles had early-onset hearing loss. The patient’s clinical presentation as well as her maternal family history of diabetes, hearing loss, and retinal disease were suggestive of maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD). Mitochondrial DNA testing revealed an m.3243A>G mutation in the MT-TL1 gene (OMIM 590050), characteristic of MIDD.Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness syndrome was first described in 1992 in a cohort of patients with the m.3243A>G point mutation.1 This mutation, which is responsible for 85% of cases of MIDD, alters mitochondrial transfer RNA and hinders the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thus leaving highly metabolically active tissues vulnerable to dysfunction.1,2 The mutation may only be inherited maternally, although both male and female children may be affected. Individuals carrying the mutation may exhibit a variety of phenotypes, ranging from isolated diabetes or hearing loss to more extensive disease affecting multiple tissues, including the retina, skeletal muscle, heart, and/or kidneys.2 Individuals within the same family can manifest a wide spectrum of disease, highlighting the variable expressivity of this condition. The same mutation also accounts for most cases of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes and some cases of Leigh syndrome.1,2Although visual symptoms associated with MIDD are uncommon, up to 86% of patients display retinal pigmentary changes.3 When present, visual symptoms may include vision loss, poor night vision, and scotomas.2 On fundus examination, patients with MIDD typically have pigment changes, including pale subretinal deposits, pigment clumps, and patchy RPE atrophy in a perifoveal and peripapillary distribution. Individuals with MIDD are also susceptible to onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy.2 Fundus autofluorescence imaging is helpful in demonstrating the disease extent and typically shows perifoveal areas of speckled or reticular autofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence in areas of RPE atrophy.4-6 As seen in this patient, full-field ERG may show mild cone dysfunction, although multifocal ERG testing is more likely to detect photoreceptor dysfunction.6Because of its heterogeneous presentation, MIDD may be mistaken for age-related macular degeneration (choice A) or other maculopathies such as pattern dystrophy or pentosan polysulfate maculopathy.7,8 These conditions can be distinguished by age at onset, medical history, family history, presence of typical drusen, and distribution of pigmentary abnormalities. Recognition of MIDD is important, as it has health implications for the patient and all maternal family members. For instance, patients typically experience decreased insulin production and require insulin treatment as opposed to metformin therapy and other oral diabetes medications (choice D). In addition, this mutation poses a risk for severe morbidity and mortality from cardiac complications and strokelike episodes. Therefore, suspected cases of MIDD warrant genetic testing and counseling rather than observation (choice B). Although no clear treatment has been identified, coenzyme Q10 therapy may offer some benefit in MIDD, as it may improve mitochondrial function. Results of an open-label randomized study suggested that coenzyme Q10 delays progression of hearing loss and diabetes in patients with MIDD. Further studies are necessary to corroborate this finding.9This patient and her primary care physician were informed of her genetic testing results, and she is undergoing a comprehensive medical evaluation with the guidance of a medical geneticist.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a family medical history and pursue genetic testing (Option C). This decision is supported by several key factors in the case:

1. Unusual retinal findings: The patient presents with abnormal retinal pigmentation, a reticular pattern of hyperautofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence imaging, and scattered macular pigment clumps. These findings are atypical for common retinal conditions and suggest a possible inherited retinal disorder.

2. Age of onset: The patient is relatively young (49 years old) for typical age-related macular degeneration, which makes option A less appropriate.

3. Systemic features: The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, mild hearing loss, and thyroid cancer. Some inherited retinal dystrophies can be associated with systemic manifestations, making it important to investigate potential genetic causes.

4. ERG findings: The full-field ERG shows mild cone system dysfunction, which could be indicative of an inherited retinal condition.

5. Lack of clear etiology: The patient's symptoms and retinal findings are not clearly explained by her known medical history or medication use, suggesting the need for further investigation.

Genetic testing can help identify specific mutations associated with inherited retinal disorders, which could explain the patient's unique retinal presentation and potentially associated systemic features. This information would be crucial for providing an accurate diagnosis, guiding management, and offering genetic counseling to the patient and her family members.

Option B (intensifying diabetes treatment) is not the most appropriate next step, as the retinal findings are not typical of diabetic retinopathy. Option D (monitoring without further workup) would be insufficient given the unusual presentation and the potential for identifying a treatable or manageable underlying condition.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Age of onset: The patient is relatively young (49 years old) for typical age-related macular degeneration, which makes option A less appropriate.\n\n3. Systemic features: The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, mild hearing loss, and thyroid cancer. Some inherited retinal dystrophies can be associated with systemic manifestations, making it important to investigate potential genetic causes.\n\n4. ERG findings: The full-field ERG shows mild cone system dysfunction, which could be indicative of an inherited retinal condition.\n\n5. Lack of clear etiology: The patient's symptoms and retinal findings are not clearly explained by her known medical history or medication use, suggesting the need for further investigation.\n\nGenetic testing can help identify specific mutations associated with inherited retinal disorders, which could explain the patient's unique retinal presentation and potentially associated systemic features. This information would be crucial for providing an accurate diagnosis, guiding management, and offering genetic counseling to the patient and her family members.\n\nOption B (intensifying diabetes treatment) is not the most appropriate next step, as the retinal findings are not typical of diabetic retinopathy. Option D (monitoring without further workup) would be insufficient given the unusual presentation and the potential for identifying a treatable or manageable underlying condition."" response_metadata={'id': 'msg_vrtx_01Wkw5tkAeGCuFSoapXtyYf9', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 748, 'output_tokens': 402}} id='run-d9753fa7-67e2-4614-a60c-7cb5e65d297b-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 748, 'output_tokens': 402, 'total_tokens': 1150}",1.0

Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy would be unusual in this age group. Normal MRI excludes orbital compression. This and severity of the disc swelling also make demyelinating or neuromyelitis optica spectrum optic neuritis unlikely. The associated systemic manifestations favor an infectious or inflammatory cause. Therefore, inflammatory and infectious serologic testing (choice B) is the preferred response. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck (choice A) would not be the preferred answer because the case is not consistent with ischemic vision loss owing to arterial disease. Observation (choice D) is not the preferred choice because some etiologies diagnosed by blood testing may require directed therapy. Oral prednisone (choice C) is not the preferred choice because this is contraindicated as monotherapy in infectious etiologies.Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibodies, quantiferon gold, HIV, rapid plasma reagin, Lyme IgG/IgM, toxoplasmosis IgG/IgM, B henselae IgG/IgM, and antiphospholipid panel results showed mild elevation of C-reactive protein level, positive B henselae IgG (1:512), and negative IgM. On follow-up examination 3 weeks after symptom onset, macular star was noted (Figure 2).Optic nerve appearance 2 weeks after initial presentation. Optos fundus images show persistent severe optic nerve swelling, macular edema, and macular star.The ocular manifestations of B henselae include neuroretinitis, optic neuropathy, anterior uveitis, choroidal neovascularization, focal retinitis/choroiditis, and/or vitritis. Although neuroretinitis is the most common presentation of posterior segment involvement in cat scratch disease, the presence of isolated disc swelling is the early manifestation of this disease.1,2 The presence of macular star is a characteristic hallmark of B henselae neuroretinitis but may not develop in all patients and is often absent early in the presentation.3 Macular star is not specific for neuroretinitis,4 also occurring in anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, disc tumor, papilledema, and toxic causes. Appropriate serologic tests should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.5 Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful to exclude inflammatory retrobulbar optic neuropathies such as optic neuritis.6 Although the role of systemic antibiotics in ocular disease is controversial, oral treatment with doxycycline and rifampin for 4 to 6 weeks in conjunction with oral steroid can shorten the disease course and accelerate the visual recovery.7 Long-term visual prognosis is reasonable, typically with minimal sequelae. However, small retinal pigmentary changes and mild postinfectious optic neuropathy may happen in some cases.7Acute B henselae infection is usually self-limited, presenting with lymphadenopathy and fever followed by nontender erythematous papules and pastules at the primary site of scratch or bite and, later, flulike symptoms. In 5% to 14% of patients, disseminated disease may develop, including ocular bartonellosis in 5% to 10% of patients.7,8 Chronic infections with flares have negative IgM and elevated IgG titers.9 Although a positive IgM titer supports the diagnosis of recent Bartonella infection, a negative one does not exclude the diagnosis. Thus, the most helpful diagnostic test remains IgG.10This patient was treated with doxycycline, rifampin, and prednisone for 6 weeks.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents (Option D).

The patient's symptoms suggest a recurrent inflammatory condition affecting the optic nerve (optic neuritis) and potentially other systems. The key features supporting this decision are:

1. Recurrent episodes: The patient has experienced monthly episodes of flu-like symptoms and blurry vision over the past 5 months, indicating a systemic and recurring process.

2. Optic nerve involvement: The current episode presents with unilateral vision loss, pain, and optic nerve swelling (papillitis) in the left eye, which is consistent with optic neuritis.

3. Associated systemic symptoms: The patient experienced muscle pain, joint swelling, and headache, suggesting a potential systemic inflammatory or autoimmune condition.

4. Normal MRI findings: The brain MRI was normal, and the orbital MRI showed only anterior swelling of the left optic nerve without other significant findings, ruling out obvious structural causes.

Given these factors, it is crucial to identify the underlying cause of the recurrent inflammation. Blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents would help to:

1. Rule out infectious causes such as syphilis, Lyme disease, or viral infections.
2. Screen for autoimmune conditions like lupus, sarcoidosis, or multiple sclerosis.
3. Check for inflammatory markers that might indicate a systemic inflammatory process.

This approach would provide valuable diagnostic information to guide further management and treatment decisions. Once the underlying cause is identified, appropriate targeted therapy can be initiated to prevent further episodes and potential permanent vision loss.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

1640,574,578,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2753511,102019,"A 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts.The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness.On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use What Would You Do Next?",Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use,Commence treatment with oral olanzapine,Commence treatment with oral clozapine,Commence cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis,Schizophrenia,A,Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use,"There are no clear differences in efficacy between licensed antipsychotic medications in head-to-head trials, although network meta-analyses1,2 suggest that clozapine, olanzapine, and amisulpride are among the most efficacious. Note: Amisulpride is approved for use in the United Kingdom where this patient was treated but is not approved for use in the United States. In addition to the short-term efficacy of antipsychotic medication, there is also evidence that maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs lowers the risk of relapse.3In addition to efficacy, the risk of adverse effects should be carefully considered when discussing treatment options (choice A). The patient in this clinical challenge is of African origin and had overweight, both of which increase the likelihood of adverse metabolic effects developing during antipsychotic treatment.4 Furthermore, psychosis itself is associated with an increased risk of metabolic dysfunction.5 Consequently, if efficacy and other risks of adverse effects are equal, treatments with a high risk of adverse metabolic effects, such as olanzapine (choice B), should be avoided if possible. Alternatives to amisulpride with relatively low levels of adverse metabolic effects include haloperidol and aripiprazole.Although clozapine (choice C) has demonstrated superiority compared with other antipsychotic medications, this has not been established for patients experiencing first episodes of psychosis, and it has a high burden of adverse effects and requires regular monitoring of full blood cell counts because of the risk of agranulocytosis. As a result, it is typically not recommended as a first-line treatment. It is, however, the only drug licensed for treatment resistance, and evidence indicates that early use in patients with treatment resistance leads to better outcomes.6Long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications are an underused treatment option and should be considered early in the illness course.7 However, even if a long-acting injectable drug is to be used from the first episode, it is generally preferable to first start with oral medication to allow an estimation of dosage and accommodate the time a drug takes to reach effective plasma levels.8The patient’s mental health team specialized in the management of first-episode psychosis, and dedicated early-intervention services are associated with considerable benefits for the individual patient and also their family.9 These teams provide social and psychological support in addition to pharmacological treatments. Cognitive behavioral therapy (choice D) does not have clear evidence of efficacy when given as a stand-alone treatment, but it shows benefit when given in combination with an antipsychotic drug.10Oral amisulpride in a dosage of 200 mg, twice daily, was prescribed initially (amisulpride is approved for use in the United Kingdom where the patient was treated). At a review 2 weeks later, although auditory hallucinations had reduced in intensity, the patient’s paranoid delusions persisted. She reported good medication concordance, and this was corroborated by the family. The dosage was therefore increased to 400 mg, twice daily, and cognitive behavioral therapy was also commenced. The patient complained of some stiffness, which improved when the morning dosage was reduced back to 200 mg, twice daily. The psychotic symptoms gradually resolved over the next 4 weeks, although she remained socially withdrawn. Her mother was supportive but became increasingly frustrated about her lack of activity and failure to get a new job, and she frequently criticized her for this. Six months after commencing amisulpride, the patient’s positive symptoms returned, and after concerns regarding weight loss secondary to reduced food and fluid intake, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Antipsychotic plasma levels at the time of admission suggested poor compliance with antipsychotic treatment. After discussing this with the patient, she reported finding it difficult to remember to take the treatment regularly, although her family also stated that she had reported to them that she did not feel the need to continue taking her medication. After considering the options, she elected to try treatment with a long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone to avoid the need to remember to take pills. This was started after trying the oral form for a week to check that it suited her.",Psychiatry,2019-10-01,2019,10,"A 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate next step would be to commence treatment with oral olanzapine (Option D). Here's the medical explanation for this decision:

1. Diagnosis: The patient presents with clear symptoms of a first-episode psychosis, likely schizophrenia. She exhibits positive symptoms (auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions) and negative symptoms (social withdrawal), along with a family history of schizophrenia.

2. Treatment approach: For first-episode psychosis, antipsychotic medication is the first-line treatment to manage acute symptoms and prevent further deterioration.

3. Choice of antipsychotic: Olanzapine is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic that is well-established as an effective treatment for first-episode psychosis. It has a favorable efficacy profile for both positive and negative symptoms.

4. Safety and tolerability: While olanzapine can cause side effects like weight gain and metabolic changes, it is generally well-tolerated and has a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects compared to first-generation antipsychotics.

5. Appropriateness for this patient: Given the patient's young age, lack of previous antipsychotic treatment, and the presence of both positive and negative symptoms, olanzapine is a suitable choice.

6. Alternative options:
   - Option A (CBT for psychosis) is beneficial but typically used as an adjunct to medication, not as a first-line treatment for acute psychosis.
   - Option B (clozapine) is usually reserved for treatment-resistant cases and not used as a first-line treatment due to its side effect profile.
   - Option C is not an action but a consideration, which should be part of the decision-making process for any treatment.

In conclusion, commencing treatment with oral olanzapine is the most appropriate next step to address the patient's acute psychotic symptoms while considering efficacy, safety, and current treatment guidelines for first-episode psychosis.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Alternative options:\n   - Option A (CBT for psychosis) is beneficial but typically used as an adjunct to medication, not as a first-line treatment for acute psychosis.\n   - Option B (clozapine) is usually reserved for treatment-resistant cases and not used as a first-line treatment due to its side effect profile.\n   - Option C is not an action but a consideration, which should be part of the decision-making process for any treatment.\n\nIn conclusion, commencing treatment with oral olanzapine is the most appropriate next step to address the patient's acute psychotic symptoms while considering efficacy, safety, and current treatment guidelines for first-episode psychosis."" response_metadata={'id': 'msg_vrtx_01XaoiDLir2phLb6bXXnmiSo', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 1039, 'output_tokens': 453}} id='run-7e83dfd6-68b0-4034-93e2-aba4139189a2-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1039, 'output_tokens': 453, 'total_tokens': 1492}",0.0

While fluorescein angiography (choice A) can characterize the vasculature of choroidal lesions, including double circulation associated with choroidal melanomas, the lesion of concern here is located in the extraocular space. Choroidal melanomas are acoustically hollow, like the mass seen here, and they most commonly metastasize to the liver, but obtaining an invasive biopsy (choice C) without further orbital imaging is inappropriate. Close monitoring alone (choice D) in the setting of a new mass is inappropriate. Orbital computed tomography was obtained (choice B).The patient presented to oculoplastics 3 weeks later with new proptosis of his right eye and restriction of upgaze motility. Imaging revealed a homogenously enhancing lesion measuring 2.5 × 3.3 × 1.9 cm displacing the superior and lateral rectus muscles (Figure 2). The mass was located proximal to the lacrimal gland in the superotemporal quadrant of the right orbit without associated bony erosion or hyperostosis. The most likely diagnoses were narrowed to lymphoma, pleomorphic adenoma, or solitary fibrous tumor.Orbital computed tomography shows a homogenously enhancing orbital mass (arrowhead) measuring 2.5 × 3.3 × 1.9 cm in the right superotemporal orbit without bony erosion or hyperostosis. There is regional mass effect on the right lateral rectus muscle.This patient required a biopsy even in the setting of a previously diagnosed lymphoma, as this lesion could represent transformation to a higher grade or a new type of lymphoma. Additionally, there have been rare reports of extraocular extension of small choroidal melanomas presumed to be choroidal nevi.1 Pathology revealed mantle cell lymphoma with κ light chain restriction, overexpression of tumor protein p53, and low mitotic count. Results of tests for tumor markers for melanoma, including S100 and human melanoma black-45 levels, were negative. The patient was referred to oncology with a plan for systemic chemotherapy with bendamustine and rituximab.Orbital lymphoma is the most common orbital neoplasm in adults.2 Most cases of orbital lymphoma are unilateral and derive from B lymphocyte origins or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue origins.3-5 Mantle cell lymphoma is relatively rare, representing only 2% to 7% of all orbital lymphoma cases.6 It may present as a secondary lymphoma of the orbit or eyelid, most often in older men.7 A 2015 review of 226 consecutive cases of conjunctival and ocular adnexal lymphoma8 showed that mantle cell lymphoma presents as a secondary manifestation of lymphoma in 61% of cases. Only a minority of patients experience classic B symptoms, including fever, lymphadenopathy, or night sweats.9 Mantle cell lymphoma can mimic myasthenia gravis with positive anti–muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies.10 Biopsy is needed to establish a definitive diagnosis.Mantle cell lymphoma management was previously limited to palliative chemotherapy; newer strategies of systemic chemotherapy combining multiple agents (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) have improved response rates.6,9 In patients who are CD20 positive, rituximab improves 5-year survival.6,9 In spite of this, many patients with mantle cell lymphoma present during advanced stages of disease, resulting in multiple relapses with poor prognosis.9 In an international multicenter review of 55 patients with a median follow-up of 33 months,6 overall survival was 65% at 3 years, and disease-specific survival was 34% at 5 years.After extensive discussion with his oncologist, the patient decided not to pursue any further treatment.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and new findings, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain orbital imaging (Option D). Here's the medical rationale:

1. New finding: The B-scan ultrasonography revealed a new retro-orbital hypoechoic cavity causing right globe deformation. This is a significant change from previous examinations and warrants further investigation.

2. Patient's medical history: The patient has a history of stage III non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma, which, although currently asymptomatic, puts him at risk for orbital involvement or metastasis.

3. Absence of acute symptoms: While the patient is asymptomatic and shows no signs of proptosis, resistance to retropulsion, or other acute orbital symptoms, the presence of a new retro-orbital mass requires thorough evaluation.

4. Differential diagnosis: The new finding could represent various conditions, including lymphoma recurrence, metastasis from prostate cancer (although in remission), or a new primary orbital tumor. Orbital imaging (such as MRI or CT) would provide detailed information about the size, extent, and characteristics of the lesion, helping to narrow down the differential diagnosis.

5. Choroidal nevus: While the patient has a history of a choroidal nevus, the new retro-orbital finding is likely unrelated and requires separate evaluation.

6. Guiding further management: Detailed orbital imaging will be crucial in determining the next steps in management, which may include biopsy, referral to oncology, or other interventions based on the imaging findings.

Monitoring the patient for 6 months (Option A) would be inappropriate given the new finding. Fluorescein angiography (Option B) would not provide information about the retro-orbital lesion. A liver biopsy (Option C) is not indicated based on the current presentation and would not help evaluate the orbital finding.

Therefore, obtaining orbital imaging is the most appropriate next step to further evaluate and characterize the newly discovered retro-orbital lesion.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Encysted empyema thoracis,Lung abscess,Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt,Bronchogenic carcinoma,C. Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt,C,Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt,"A pyogenic brain abscess can occur because of purulent spread from infections in the middle ear, meninges, paranasal sinuses, mastoids, lungs (in cases of empyema, bronchiactesis, and pulmonary abscess), heart (in cases of infective endocarditis or cyanotic congenital heart diseases), gastrointestinal tract, or mouth (in cases of dental infection). A brain abscess can also occur after head trauma and neurosurgical procedures.1 Among the pulmonary causes, digital clubbing and pyogenic brain abscess can be seen in empyema thoracis, lung abscess, bronchiactesis, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary arteriovenous shunts.2 Symptoms of pulmonary arteriovenous shunt depend on the size of the shunt. A patient with a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt may remain asymptomatic, whereas patients with empyema thoracis and lung abscess present with acute fever, chest pain, cough, and dyspnea on exertion or at rest.3With high suspicion of a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt, we performed bubble echocardiography testing with agitated saline infused through the left antecubital vein. During the fifth cardiac cycle, a large number of bubbles appeared in the left atria, suggesting a right-to-left shunt. There was no evidence of a patent foramen ovale. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a large pulmonary arteriovenous shunt in the left lung. The arterial feeder of the shunt arose from the pulmonary artery of the left upper lobe. The shunt drained into the left atrium via a dilated pulmonary vein.Pulmonary arteriovenous shunts can be histologically characterized as pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae (PAVF) or arteriovenous malformations. Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae are abnormal dilated vessels that provide right-to-left shunts between the pulmonary artery and veins, whereas arteriovenous malformations are tumorous hemangiomas with localized overgrowth of thick vessels.4 Only 9% of patients with PAVF develop pyogenic brain abscesses5; in these cases, PAVF can produce paradoxical septic emboli to brain and brain abscesses. The other postulated mechanism is the formation of focal cerebral ischemia attributable to high blood viscosity, which forms a nidus for cerebral infections.6Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae can be hereditary or acquired. Approximately 70% cases of PAVF are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome).7 Epistaxis, hemoptysis, or peripheral telangiectasias are characteristic manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia; these were not seen in this patient.Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae occur twice often in women as in men.7 Nearly 50% patients may have associated peripheral arteriovenous fistulae.3 Because of right-to-left shunting, a state of chronic hypoxemia develops, and it continues to progress if the PAVF is left untreated.The clinical features of a PAVF depend on its size. Up to 55% of patients may remain asymptomatic.3 Common presenting features are dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, and cough. The complications of PAVF occur because of chronic hypoxemia, and they include polycythemia, recurrent syncopal attacks, cyanosis, and clubbing.3 The central nervous system complications of PAVF are transient ischemic attacks, migraine, stroke, brain abscess, and seizures.3 A contrast computed tomographic scan of the chest is a noninvasive way to diagnose PAVF. However, pulmonary angiography is required for the precise localization of feeder and draining vessels and embolization of the arterial feeder.Intravascular embolization of the pulmonary shunt remains a preferred treatment.3 Surgery is considered in patients with allergies to contrast material and those with very large shunts that are not amenable to embolization.In this patient, we closed the pulmonary shunt with an intravascular approach. Shunt closure produced a considerable improvement in oxygen saturation and hematocrit levels. To treat the patient’s brain abscesses, we used injectable ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole on an empirical basis. After 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment, the brain abscesses healed completely.The present case highlights that a combination of features, such as digital clubbing, poor oxygen saturation, a raised hematocrit level, and the absence of congenital heart disease on echocardiography, should prompt clinicians to look for PAVF in a patient with a pyogenic brain abscess. Intravascular or surgical management of PAVF is essential to prevent further complications.",Neurology,2019-10-01,2019,10,"A 34-year-old man presented with headache, double vision, and seizures for 1 month and altered consciousness for 1 week.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis for this patient is a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt (option B). This conclusion is based on several key findings in the clinical case:

1. Neurological symptoms: The patient presents with headache, double vision, seizures, and altered consciousness, which can be explained by brain abscesses secondary to paradoxical embolism through a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt.

2. Imaging findings: The cranial MRI shows multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the brain, consistent with brain abscesses. These are often seen in patients with right-to-left shunts, allowing bacteria to bypass the lung's filtering mechanism.

3. Chest radiograph: The nodular shadow in the left middle lung field is consistent with a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM).

4. Hypoxemia: The patient's arterial oxygen saturation of 80% indicates significant hypoxemia, which is characteristic of right-to-left shunting through a PAVM.

5. Polycythemia: The elevated hemoglobin (19.3 g/dL) and hematocrit (62.4%) suggest chronic hypoxemia, leading to secondary polycythemia as a compensatory mechanism.

6. Digital clubbing: Grade III clubbing in fingers and toes is often associated with chronic hypoxemia, further supporting the presence of a long-standing right-to-left shunt.

7. Absence of fever and normal blood cultures: This makes an infectious etiology less likely and supports a non-infectious cause for the brain abscesses.

The combination of neurological symptoms, brain abscesses, pulmonary nodule, hypoxemia, polycythemia, and digital clubbing strongly suggests a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt as the underlying diagnosis. This condition allows for right-to-left shunting of blood, bypassing the lung's filtering capacity and leading to paradoxical embolism and brain abscesses.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Retinoblastoma presents as 1 or more retinal masses and is often associated with calcifications and subretinal or vitreous seeds.1 Large vessels generally dive into the tumor and fine intratumoral vessels can be seen. If retinal astrocytoma was suspected, a skin examination for other stigmata of tuberous sclerosis (eg, ash leaf spots and shagreen patches) should be performed. Genetic testing for the TSC1 gene (chromosome 9) and TSC2 gene (chromosome 16) can be informative. However, congenital and acquired astrocytomas present as whitish-gray masses within the retinal nerve fiber layer with fine intratumoral vessels.1 Diagnostic enucleation is indicated for medulloepithelioma, usually found in the ciliary body, for which a biopsy is contraindicated. Primary therapeutic enucleation may be indicated for retinoblastoma invading the optic nerve, for which orbital MRI can be helpful, along with brain MRI to assess for “trilateral” disease with pinealoblastoma. However, this case is most consistent with morning glory disc anomaly (MGDA).Morning glory disc anomaly is characterized by a funnel-shaped excavation in the optic disc with an overlying central glial tuft and surrounding chorioretinal pigmentation. In this case, the optic nerve head itself could not be well visualized because of the relatively large glial tuft that simulated a tumor, but ultrasonography results demonstrated the optic nerve excavation. Retinal vasculature emerging from the disc follows an abnormally straight, radial pattern and arteries and veins are often difficult to distinguish from one another.2 In this case, fluorescein angiography confirmed the absence of intratumoral vessels, as expected, with staining of the central glial tuft.Morning glory disc anomaly often presents with strabismus, leukocoria, or unilateral decreased vision. A visual prognosis of 20/200 to counting fingers is typical. Amblyopia treatment may improve visual acuity, with some patients reaching a visual acuity greater than 20/40.3 Ophthalmic care for patients with MGDA must also include patient education and close monitoring for retinal detachments, as one study found that over 10 years, one-third of patients with MGDA developed a retinal detachment.4Patients with MGDA should be evaluated for associated systemic anomalies. The most common is midline craniofacial defects, including a wide and flat nasal bridge and cleft lip and palate. Other central nervous system associations include basal encephalocele, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and Chiari 1 malformation.5,6 Morning glory disc anomaly is thought to be associated with these conditions through a primary mesenchymal defect, as MGDA is thought to arise from a failure in the development of the posterior sclera and lamina cribrosa.5 Importantly, MGDA is also associated with moyamoya disease, which is characterized by an abnormal narrowing of cerebral vasculature that greatly increases the risk of stroke. Routine monitoring with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or cerebral angiography is necessary, as this disease may be progressive.7 Furthermore, moyamoya disease increases the risk for anesthetic complications, so anesthesia should be minimized in these patients.8 For these reasons, the correct course of action for this patient includes MRI/MRA of the head.In summary, the central glial tuft of MGDA may obscure some of the more classic vascular features of the disease and simulate a white mass of the optic nerve head. Patients with MGDA need to be closely followed up by an ophthalmologist to optimize visual acuity and monitor for retinal detachments, and all patients should receive MRI/MRA of the head to evaluate for moyamoya disease or other brain or craniofacial defects.This patient underwent a brain MRI and MRA. The results revealed a Chiari 1 malformation but no moyamoya disease.",Ophthalmology,2019-09-01,2019,9,"An 18-month-old girl with an unremarkable medical history was referred to ocular oncology from pediatric ophthalmology for an intraocular mass near the optic nerve.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most appropriate next step would be option D: Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for optic nerve invasion and brain MRI to assess for a pineal gland tumor, followed by chemotherapy for the eye.

The clinical case describes an 18-month-old girl with a whitish intraocular mass near the optic nerve, leukocoria, and exophoria in the left eye. These findings, along with the ultrasonography results showing an elevated retinal mass overlying an excavated optic nerve head with a focus of hyperechogenicity consistent with calcium, strongly suggest retinoblastoma.

Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children. Given the proximity of the mass to the optic nerve and its potential for invasion, it is crucial to perform orbital MRI to assess the extent of the tumor and evaluate for optic nerve involvement. Additionally, brain MRI is necessary to rule out trilateral retinoblastoma, which involves a pineal gland tumor in addition to ocular involvement.

Chemotherapy is the preferred initial treatment for most cases of retinoblastoma, especially when there is a possibility of salvaging vision. It can help shrink the tumor and potentially avoid enucleation, which is why immediate enucleation (option C) is not the best choice at this stage.

Options A and B are less appropriate in this case. While genetic testing can be valuable in retinoblastoma cases, it is not the immediate priority. Similarly, observation alone (option B) would be inadequate given the likely diagnosis of a malignant tumor.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform the necessary imaging studies to fully assess the extent of the disease, followed by chemotherapy to treat the eye and potentially preserve vision.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Chorea-acanthocytosis,C,Chorea-acanthocytosis,"The patient’s most prominent clinical manifestation was orofacial dyskinesia; therefore, hereditary and secondary dystonia was considered. Wilson disease was excluded because his ceruloplasmin levels were normal. There was no evidence of other metabolic or autoimmune diseases.Acanthocytes in peripheral blood were a significant feature. This led to the consideration of neuroacanthocytosis and inherited disorders of lipoprotein metabolism (eg, abetalipoproteinemia and hypobetalipoproteinemia); the latter leads to vitamin E malabsorption.1 The prominence of caudate head atrophy indicated several extrapyramidal diseases, including Huntington disease, Huntington disease–like 2 (HDL-2), chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc), and McLeod syndrome.1-3 Although his low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B levels decreased, his vitamin E levels were normal; thus, hypobetalipoproteinemia was unlikely. Acanthocytes are not present in Huntington disease, therefore it was excluded.Neuroacanthocytosis describes a group of heterogeneous neurological disorders in which the basal ganglia are affected, leading to various movement disorders. Neuroacanthocytosis includes pantothenate kinase–associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), HDL-2, ChAc, and McLeod syndrome.1,4 Orofacial, lingual, and limb dystonia, dysarthria, choreoathetosis, and spasticity are the initial manifestations of PKAN. Patients usually develop pigmentary retinopathy. Cognitive impairment is also a prominent feature in many PKAN cases. In some patients, iron accumulation in the basal ganglia results in the typical “eye-of-the-tiger” magnetic resonance imaging sign.5 The patient’s fundus examination results were normal, so PKAN was unlikely. Huntington disease–like 2 is autosomal dominant inherited because of an expanded trinucleotide repeat of the junctophilin-3 gene and it presents with chorea, parkinsonism, and dystonia. Deep reflexes are usually brisk, and there is no peripheral nerve or muscle involvement.6 Diminished/absent deep reflexes combined with markedly elevated CK levels and reduced sensory nerve action potentials ruled out HDL-2.Chorea-acanthocytosis is a progressive autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. It is characterized by chorea and orofaciolingual dystonia resulting in orofacial dyskinesias, dysarthria, involuntary vocalizations, and involuntary tongue- and lip-biting. Neuromuscular involvement is another important ChAc feature, including variable muscle weakness and atrophy, areflexia, and mild axonal neuropathy. Creatine kinase elevation (up to 3000 U/L) occurs in most patients with ChAc; however, electromyogram results usually demonstrate neuropathic changes.1,4The patient showed obvious orofacial dyskinesias, combined with substantial CK elevation, axonal peripheral neuropathy, muscle neurogenic damage, and typical caudate head atrophy. This suggested ChAc, although trunk and limb chorea had not yet been revealed. We performed whole-exome sequencing  to verify the diagnosis and exclude other rare causes. Sequencing results revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in the VPS13A gene: a point mutation c.2964 + 5(IVS28)G>A in one allele and c.5881(exon45)C>T in the other. The patient’s parents were carriers of a mutation but were themselves unaffected. Thus, the patient received a diagnosis of ChAc. Haloperidol, 2 mg twice daily, was administered to ameliorate hyperkinetic movement.Chorea-acanthocytosis is caused by mutations of the VPS13A gene, which codes for chorein. Chorein is implicated in intracellular protein sorting and transport; however, to our knowledge, the exact mechanisms are unknown. Chorein is widely expressed in various organs and tissues, including the brain and erythrocytes. In ChAc, chorein is markedly reduced or absent.1,4 Treatment is symptomatic as no curative treatments exist.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate diagnosis for this clinical case is Chorea-acanthocytosis. This conclusion is based on several key features presented in the case:

1. Age of onset: The patient's symptoms began at age 23, which is consistent with the typical onset of chorea-acanthocytosis in early adulthood.

2. Orofaciolingual movements: The patient exhibits involuntary movements of the mouth, tongue, and face, which are characteristic of chorea-acanthocytosis.

3. Dysphagia and dysarthria: These symptoms are common in chorea-acanthocytosis due to the involvement of orofacial muscles.

4. Self-mutilation: The involuntary tongue- and lip-biting is a hallmark feature of chorea-acanthocytosis.

5. Gait disturbance: The patient's mildly wide-based gait is consistent with the neurological deterioration seen in this condition.

6. Elevated CK levels: Significantly elevated creatine kinase (2304 U/L) is commonly observed in chorea-acanthocytosis due to muscle involvement.

7. Acanthocytes: The presence of acanthocytes in the blood smear is a defining feature of this disorder.

8. Brain imaging: The marked bilateral caudate head atrophy seen on MRI is typical of chorea-acanthocytosis.

9. Neurogenic damage: The electromyogram showing neurogenic damage in lower limb muscles is consistent with the peripheral neuropathy often seen in this condition.

Poppers have also been historically used by men who have sex with men for their ability to relax the anal sphincter. Although poppers are illegal, they can be purchased in some countries as alternative products, which include room deodorizers or video head cleaners.1 The use of poppers is thought to be high and ranges between 5% to 6% in French teenagers2 and up to 10% of adults in the United Kingdom.1 However, their use may be higher in certain groups and is estimated to be about 60% in Australia’s gay community.3While the exact mechanism causing damage of the central photoreceptors is still uncertain, Brat el al4 suggested that alkyl nitrites may cause an increase in nitric oxide. Nitric oxide exposure is known to raise intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, eventually causing photoreceptor apoptosis.A possible association between the use of poppers and maculopathy was first proposed in 2004.5 After this first description, several reports have characterized this clinical entity.2,4,6-8 In detail, ophthalmoscopy findings can be very subtle, with more striking changes seen on OCT, which may show either a hyperreflective or hyporeflective ellipsoid zone band. Although OCT changes associated with poppers maculopathy have been thus characterized, these alterations are not specific for this maculopathy. As an example, solar maculopathy may be characterized by similar changes at the fovea.9 Furthermore, similar foveal abnormalities may occur after blunt ocular trauma and whiplash injury.10 For these reasons, when a patient presents with a localized alteration of the foveal photoreceptors, a focused drug history of the patient is mandatory. Nonetheless, the diagnosis can be complicated by patient denial of popper use. Noteworthy, the use of poppers was suggested to produce a dose-related increase in photoreceptor damage, with individuals with long-term regular use showing most severe macular alterations.1The relatively easy availability of poppers has increased their popularity as recreational drugs. Lesions occurring in poppers maculopathy are frequently permanent and may be associated with a substantial effect on vision. This case highlights the importance of obtaining an in-depth medical and personal history of patients presenting with a focal damage of the foveal photoreceptors. In this case, the patient revealed his recreational use of different drugs, including poppers, cannabis, and cocaine, for approximately 15 years.Prescribing laboratory testing to investigate causes of intraocular inflammation (choice A) would not be preferred because a bilateral foveal photoreceptor loss is an uncommon presentation for uveitis, especially in a patient without other ocular signs of inflammation. A dye angiography (choice B) was not recommended as the next step because no other retinal and/or choroidal alterations were evident on spectral-domain OCT images. Treating the patient with antiviral drugs (choice D) would not be the next recommended step because of the absence of a viral infection.The patient was extensively informed about his condition and the prognosis. Moreover, he was screened for HIV, as many patients with poppers maculopathy were reported to be affected by this infection,1 and the result was negative. Importantly, he was advised to discontinue the use of poppers and to follow up with a medical retina specialist.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to obtain an in-depth medical and personal history, including drug history. This decision is based on several factors:

1. Lack of comprehensive history: The clinical case provides limited information about the patient's medical and personal history, which is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management of macular lesions.

2. Absence of obvious inflammation: The case doesn't mention any signs of active intraocular inflammation, making option C (laboratory testing for inflammation) less appropriate as an initial step.

3. Bilateral presentation: The bilateral nature of the macular lesions suggests a systemic cause or exposure rather than a localized issue, emphasizing the importance of a thorough history.

4. Subtle clinical findings: The patient has good visual acuity (20/20 OU) with only slightly eccentric vision and subtle yellow foveal spots. These findings, along with the OCT results showing focal interruption of foveal photoreceptors, could be consistent with various conditions, including drug toxicity or inherited retinal disorders.

5. Non-invasive approach: Obtaining a detailed history is a non-invasive first step that can guide further diagnostic testing or management decisions.

By gathering a comprehensive medical and personal history, including drug history, the healthcare provider can identify potential causes of the macular lesions, such as medication side effects (e.g., hydroxychloroquine toxicity), occupational exposures, or hereditary factors.

Given this patient’s presentation with mucosal erosions in the setting of pneumonia, his younger age, and evanescent mild skin involvement, a diagnosis of M pneumoniae–induced rash and mucositis (MIRM) was favored over M pneumoniae–induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which can have a similar presentation but is characterized by more severe mucocutaneous involvement.Because of the favorable prognosis of MIRM and its associated ocular manifestations,1 initiation of topical ophthalmic therapy consisting of antibiotic prophylaxis and mild corticosteroids (choice B) is the first recommended course. Systemic corticosteroids (choice A) are not recommended as the next step because the patient had a mild presentation and did not exhibit persistent conjunctivitis despite topical therapy. Amniotic membrane transplantation (choice C) is not recommended because it is an aggressive treatment reserved for cases of biopsy-proven or highly suspected SJS; this treatment carries substantial (albeit temporary) morbidity in conscious patients, given the reduction of vision due to amniotic membranes overlying the cornea and discomfort caused by symblepharon rings in the fornices.2 Antibiotic cessation (choice D) would not be the preferred answer because although drug-induced SJS or toxic epidermal necrolysis was on the differential diagnosis, given the patient’s medication allergies, the lack of characteristic skin sloughing argued against this diagnosis.2,3M pneumoniae immunoglobulin measurements were within normal limits on admission (IgM, <0.90 optical density; IgG, 513 U/mL), but repeated testing 3 weeks later confirmed the diagnosis (IgM, 3.09 optical density; IgG, 6525 U/mL), as occurs in 30% to 60% of children, given the delayed peak time of M pneumoniae IgG and IgM.4,5M pneumoniae is a common culprit among atypical pathogens causing pneumonia in children and adolescents, especially during the spring and autumn, and should be considered even with initially negative serologies.M pneumoniae–induced rash and mucositis was first described and distinguished from SJS in 2015.1 Both conditions may present with mucocutaneous eruptions following an infection with M pneumoniae, but MIRM remains predominantly mucosal with limited (if any) cutaneous involvement. Commonly involved sites are oral (94%), ocular (82%), and genital (63%) mucosa. Presentations characterized by eruptions isolated to the mucosa were previously termed incomplete SJS or Fuchs syndrome.1M pneumoniae–induced rash and mucositis most often presents in young boys and adolescents and has an excellent prognosis compared with SJS.1 Ocular findings include bilateral conjunctivitis and, less often, corneal ulceration, photophobia, and eyelid edema that typically resolve without sequelae.1,6-8 Conversely, SJS can have severe sequelae, including ocular surface sloughing and blindness.2To our knowledge, no evidence-based treatment guidelines for MIRM currently exist; however, topical antibiotic and steroid therapies combined with ocular surface lubrication are usually sufficient to allow for full resolution.1,6-9 In contrast to SJS or toxic epidermal necrolysis, amniotic membrane transplantation appears to be unnecessary.2This case illustrates recognizing MIRM as a distinct entity from M pneumoniae–induced SJS. Confidence in the diagnosis might avert measures such as amniotic membrane transplantation, which, although sight saving, might carry clinically relevant morbidity, especially in pediatric patients.The patient’s conjunctival ulcerations resolved 3 days after initiation of therapy; on discharge from hospital, antibiotic eyedrops were discontinued, and the corticosteroid ointment was gradually tapered.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, this patient is likely experiencing Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), a severe adverse drug reaction. The decision to discontinue antibiotics and avoid all medications associated with SJS is the most appropriate course of action for the following reasons:

1. Symptoms: The patient presents with classic signs of SJS, including bilateral eye redness, erythematous chest rash, lip blistering, and worsening sore throat. These symptoms developed while on antibiotic treatment, suggesting a drug-induced reaction.

2. Medical history: The patient has a documented history of allergies to multiple antibiotics, including β-lactams, macrolides, and cephalosporins, predisposing him to severe drug reactions.

3. Timing: The symptoms appeared 8 days into a 10-day course of antibiotics, which is consistent with the typical onset of SJS (4-28 days after starting a new medication).

4. Ocular findings: The bilateral conjunctival hyperemia, epithelial ulcerations, and pseudomembranes are characteristic of ocular involvement in SJS.

5. Mucosal involvement: The presence of lip erosions with hemorrhagic crusts is typical of SJS mucosal involvement.

Discontinuing the offending medications is crucial in managing SJS to prevent further progression of the condition. Avoiding all medications associated with SJS is essential to prevent future episodes, given the patient's history of multiple drug allergies.

While other options like topical antibiotics, corticosteroids, or amniotic membrane transplantation may be considered in the management of SJS, the primary and most urgent step is to remove the causative agent. Systemic corticosteroids are controversial in SJS management and should not be the first-line approach without careful consideration of risks and benefits.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

This clinical finding most commonly appears in the posterior pole.1 Choroidal folds are further accentuated on fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography. B-scan ultrasonography may additionally demonstrate retinal and choroidal thickening with a flattening of the posterior globe. Choroidal folds should be differentiated from retinal folds, which are lighter and less distinct on fluorescein angiography and are commonly associated with optic disc edema (ie, Patton lines) or areas of retinal traction, as in epiretinal membranes or proliferative vitreoretinopathy.2The etiology of choroidal folds may stem from a series of etiologies. Gasperini et al3 proposed the mnemonic “THIN RPE” to recall the most common etiologies, which include tumor, hypotony, inflammation, idiopathic, neovascular membrane, retrobulbar mass, papilledema, and extraocular hardware (eg, scleral buckles or plaques).3 Idiopathic choroidal folds may be found bilaterally and are often associated with mild hyperopia. Scleral displacement by a retrobulbar lesion may induce choroidal distortion. Corrugations may also arise because of scleral shrinkage, in the setting of prolonged inflammation or traction, and from neovascular sub-RPE contraction.4-7A diagnostic workup for choroidal folds should be guided by the suspected etiology. In addition to a complete ophthalmologic examination (to include visual acuity), further evaluation with fluorescein angiography, echography, and optical coherence tomography may be indicated. Orbital imaging via magnetic resonance imaging with intravenous contrast should be pursued in cases of globe proptosis, ocular dysmotility, or other clinical features suggestive of an orbital lesion. Choroidal folds noted postoperatively may result from ocular hypotony. Pulsatile proptosis should prompt evaluation for a vascular lesion. Thyroid orbitopathy should always be considered in the setting of chronic unilateral exophthalmos once neoplasm has been excluded.Management varies based on the underlying pathology. With appropriate treatment, the best-corrected visual acuity is usually unaffected.8 Sequela of long-standing choroidal folds may include the development of a focal, beadlike RPE defect along a choroidal fold, which is sometimes followed by subretinal neovascularization.9,10The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and the results showed a large contrast-enhancing intraconal mass with medial displacement of the optic nerve (Figure 2). One week later he underwent lateral orbitotomy with en bloc resection of a well-encapsulated 2.5-cm violaceous lesion. Pathologic evaluation results revealed dilated, cavernous erythrocyte-filled vascular spaces separated by connective tissue stroma, consistent with a cavernous hemangioma. These lesions are the most common benign orbital neoplasms in adults and often present with painless, progressive proptosis, as in this case.

[Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits is the most appropriate next step in this clinical scenario. The patient presents with unilateral proptosis, visual acuity changes, and extraocular movement limitations, which strongly suggest an orbital mass. Given the patient's history of melanoma, there is a concern for possible metastatic disease.

MRI of the orbits would provide detailed imaging of the orbital structures, allowing for visualization of any soft tissue masses, their extent, and their relationship to surrounding structures. It can help differentiate between various causes of proptosis, such as thyroid eye disease, orbital tumors, or vascular malformations.

While thyroid testing (option A) could be considered due to the possibility of thyroid eye disease, the unilateral presentation and lack of typical symptoms make this less likely. Computed angiography (option C) might be useful if a vascular lesion was suspected, but MRI would be more comprehensive for evaluating orbital pathology. Applanation tonometry (option D) to measure intraocular pressure is not the priority here, as it wouldn't address the underlying cause of proptosis.

The MRI findings would guide further management, potentially including biopsy if a mass is identified, especially considering the patient's history of melanoma.]","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Please analyze the following clinical case and the related question:

<clinical_case>
A 53-year-old man presented to his ophthalmologist for a newly noticed bulging left eye. He reported several eyeglass prescription changes in the left eye over the past 2 years and frequent ipsilateral tearing. He denied ocular discomfort, headaches, or double vision. He had a distant history of right temple melanoma that was excised with clean margins and accompanied by a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy result.On examination, he was found to have a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS, with a normal pupillary response and intact color vision bilaterally. He had a mild limitation of left abduction and supraduction. He had 5 mm of relative left proptosis, with moderate resistance to retropulsion of the left globe. No change in globe position was appreciated with systolic pulsations or the Valsalva maneuver. Anterior segment examination results were normal bilaterally. Dilated fundus examination results of the left eye revealed an abnormality of the posterior pole (Figure 1A), which was confirmed on fluorescein angiography (Figure 1B).Color fundus photograph (A) and fluorescein angiography (B).

He had woken up earlier that morning with normal visual acuity, but his visual acuity had progressively worsened to the point that he was unable to work. He denied additional symptoms, other than mild tearing. Per his ophthalmologist, his visual acuity improved with a −10 diopter lens, but his intraocular pressure was elevated to between 30 and 40 mm Hg OU. The patient was sent to the emergency department, where the authors’ consultation team evaluated him. The patient’s medical history was remarkable for hypertension and asthma. He denied smoking, drinking alcohol, and using recreational drugs. A review of symptoms was otherwise negative. His medications included losartan, albuterol, and fluticasone. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/400 OU (while wearing prescription lenses, −2.75 + 1.00 × 090 OD and −2.50 + 1.00 × 081 OS). His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OU (manifest refraction, −12.00 + 1.75 × 097 OD and −10.75 + 0.25 × 050 OS). His intraocular pressure was 19 OU. Sensorimotor and external examination results were normal.

Because he subsequently developed elevated intraocular pressures and blurry vision, this history and clinical findings were concerning for angle-closure glaucoma, presumably induced by phentermine-topiramate. Since being approved by the Food and Drug Administration for weight loss in 2012,1 one other case of presumed phentermine-topiramate–induced glaucoma has been reported in the literature.2 Other drugs implicated in secondary angle-closure glaucoma include acetazolamide, hydrochlorothiazide, and venlafaxine,3,4 which the patient denied taking.Clinical findings of topiramate-induced glaucoma include axial shallowing of the anterior chambers and elevated intraocular pressure,4 which typically occur within the first 2 weeks after initial drug usage.5,6 Drug-induced ciliochoroidal effusions and ciliary body edema can anteriorly displace the lens-iris diaphragm (Figure 1). Although the underlying mechanism of drug-induced choroidal swelling is unknown, there are several theories. One theory involves an immunologic mechanism whereby drugs bound to choroidal tissue trigger an immune response. Another theory involves a pharmacogenetic mechanism whereby drugs alter serotonin metabolism in the eye.3Whereas this patient had taken 1 dose (2 pills), the patient in the previously reported case2 took daily doses of 3.75 mg of phentermine combined with 23 mg of topiramate for 1 week. Phentermine and topiramate are excreted slowly, with half-lives of 20 hours and 65 hours, respectively.1Drug-induced secondary angle-closure glaucoma is an emergency that necessitates cessation of the offending drug. With this patient, the intraocular pressure spontaneously decreased to normal within 24 hours without any interventions. This differs from the previously reported case in the literature,2 in which treatment involved high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone and mannitol in the emergency department followed by 2 weeks of topical difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion, atropine sulfate, and a fixed combination of brimonidine and timolol, even though the elevated intraocular pressure also resolved in the previously reported case2 24 hours later. This case highlights that aggressive treatment may not be necessary in certain cases.Peripheral iridotomy (choice A) is the standard treatment for primary angle-closure glaucoma7 but does not relieve secondary angle-closure glaucoma attributable to choroidal effusion.4 A magnetic resonance image to evaluate for masses (choice B) would not be indicated, because an orbital mass typically causes hyperopic shift and chorioretinal folds. Lens extraction (choice C) could be a treatment option for chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma.8The patient was advised to discontinue phentermine-topiramate. Counseling was provided regarding the nature of his eye condition and medications to avoid. At 2 weeks’ follow-up, his visual acuity had returned to 20/20 OU with his old prescription lens. Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy showed resolution of anterior choroidal effusions (Figure 2).Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy image.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform peripheral iridotomy (Option D). Here's the medical explanation:

The patient presents with acute bilateral vision loss, initially improved with a high minus lens correction, and elevated intraocular pressure. The examination reveals shallow anterior chambers, closed angles on gonioscopy, and ultrasonographic evidence of ciliary body edema and anterior uveal effusion. These findings are consistent with acute angle-closure glaucoma secondary to uveal effusion syndrome.

Peripheral iridotomy is the standard first-line treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma. It creates a small opening in the iris, allowing aqueous humor to flow from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber, equalizing pressure and deepening the anterior chamber. This procedure can help relieve the acute angle closure and reduce intraocular pressure.

The other options are less appropriate:

A. MRI is not necessary at this point, as the ultrasound has already shown no masses and revealed the uveal effusion.
B. Clear lens extraction is too aggressive as an initial treatment and unnecessary given the patient's young age and clear lenses.
C. Observation alone is insufficient given the acute nature and severity of the condition.

Peripheral iridotomy addresses the immediate concern of angle closure and can potentially break the acute attack, making it the most appropriate next step in management.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

The graft-host interface haze and the filamentous-like changes demonstrated on in vivo confocal microscopy were highly suggestive of filamentous fungal interface infectious keratitis (IIK). Adding oral antibiotic (choice A) would not provide any additional benefit, and restarting topical steroids would further exacerbate the fungal IIK (choice C). Removing and sending the DSAEK graft for culture and sensitivity (choice D) would be a reasonable option, but a trial of antifungal treatment (choice B) should be considered first.With the advantages of faster postoperative recovery, stronger graft-host junction, and lesser risk of immunological rejection, lamellar keratoplasty has gradually surpassed penetrating keratoplasty for many corneal diseases during the past decade.1,2 However the creation of a large lamellar graft-host interface allows organisms to be introduced during graft preparation, adhere to a cut stromal surface, persist for months sequestered from host immune response, and be inaccessible to topical and systemic antimicrobial therapy. Noninfectious haze, debris, and pigment can also appear in the interface.3Postlamellar keratoplasty IIK is an uncommon and possibly underrecognized complication that has been reported most commonly after DSAEK and, to a lesser extent, after deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty and Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty.4 It usually manifests at around 1 month, with a range of 1 to 120 days after DSAEK. Candida species has been shown to be the most common (75%) culprit for post-DSAEK IIK.4 The deep-seated location of the infection causes limited access for microbiological investigation (such as corneal scraping) and penetration of antibiotic treatment, posing a difficult conundrum to the clinicians. Donor rims culture result should always be pursued as it may provide good correlation with the underlying causative microorganism of the IIK.4 In vivo confocal microscopy, a noninvasive diagnostic tool, may enable direct visualization of the filaments and budding-like changes in fungal IIK of filamentous and yeast origin,4,5 respectively, along with several other unique features.6 In the present case, it is likely that the onset of IIK was heralded by an infection at the temporal corneal wound (which explains the atypical presence of epithelial defect), with further tracking to the graft-host interface through the previous corneal incision. The unusually quick resolution of IIK with topical and oral antifungal treatment alone could be attributed to the rapid diagnosis (with the aid of in vivo confocal microscopy) and the presence of epithelial defect, which enabled better penetration of the topical treatment.Medical antimicrobial therapy, either topical, systemic, or intrastromal, should be tried first as they may sometimes satisfactorily resolve the infection.4 However, surgical interventions, such as replacing the infected DSAEK graft with another DSAEK graft or therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, are often required to achieve complete eradication of the infection.4 As these cases normally present as an acute ophthalmic problem through the eye emergency department, clinicians who are not familiar with this clinical entity should have a low threshold of seeking help from specialists in corneal diseases if judged warranted for further management.After the diagnosis, the patient started receiving topical natamycin, 5%, and voriconazole, 1%, drops every hour and 200 mg of oral voriconazole twice a day for 1 day, then 100 mg twice a day for 2 weeks. Topical antibiotic therapy was switched to levofloxacin, 0.5%, 6 times a day for 5 days to cover for possible bacterial infection. The IIK and hypopyon quickly resolved within 5 days, and the epithelial defect healed after 6 weeks. Topical antifungal treatment was gradually tapered over 3 months, and the graft remained clear with a corrected-distance visual acuity of 20/20.",Ophthalmology,2019-08-01,2019,8,"A 79-year-old woman presented to the eye emergency department with a 2-day history of right eye pain and photophobia.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to restart topical steroid drops. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Negative microbiological results: The corneal scrapes and donor rim culture were negative, suggesting that a bacterial or fungal infection is less likely.

2. Graft-host interface haze with crisscross pattern: This distinctive appearance, especially when combined with the in vivo confocal microscopy findings, is highly suggestive of interface inflammation rather than infection.

3. Recent history of DSAEK: The patient had undergone DSAEK 5 months prior and was on topical steroids, which were discontinued when infection was suspected. The sudden cessation of steroids in a post-transplant patient can lead to an inflammatory response.

4. Rapid onset of symptoms: The 2-day history of symptoms is more consistent with an acute inflammatory response than a slowly progressing infection.

5. Initial good response to surgery: The patient had achieved 20/20 vision after the DSAEK, indicating a successful graft. The sudden decline is more likely due to an inflammatory process than a chronic infection.

Restarting topical steroids would help manage the inflammatory response, which appears to be the primary issue here. The other options (removing the graft, starting antifungals, or broad-spectrum antibiotics) are more aggressive interventions that are not warranted given the negative cultures and the clinical picture suggestive of inflammation rather than infection. If the condition improves with steroid treatment, it would confirm the diagnosis of interface inflammation and avoid unnecessary, potentially harmful interventions.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Whiplash maculopathy was described in 1978,1 with all patients presenting with an immediate mild reduction in visual acuity after a car crash. Subsequent studies with OCT revealed bilateral macular thickening, with cystoid abnormalities located in the outer retina as well as preservation of the inner retinal layers.2 An apparent separation between the external plexiform and the external nuclear layers was noted.3Other retinal traumatic damages affecting the posterior pole can occur after a car crash: a macular hole, a Purtscher retinopathy,4 or a retinae commotio. Retinae commotio is also called Berlin edema if the posterior pole is involved. However, the name might be confusing because there is no cystoid edema; rather, there is a hyperreflectivity located at the photoreceptor–retinal pigment epithelium complex.5 Whiplash maculopathy seems to result from a bilateral anteroposterior vitreomacular traction pulling on the fovea during a severe whiplash head trauma.6In this case, there was a relevant asymmetry of the abnormalities on OCT comparing the left and right eyes. The left eye, which also had an epiretinal membrane, had less macular edema. This could be coincidental or associated with the epiretinal membrane if the epiretinal membrane provided tangential forces opposing the anteroposterior traction during the accident.Observation seems to be the best treatment option because spontaneous functional and anatomic resolution occurs in general after a few days.1,3 This could explain why only a few cases can be found in the literature. In most of the case reports, a complete resolution is observed. However, Cappello et al3 described a case with a persistent scotoma due to the disruption of the interdigitation line. There is no evidence to our knowledge that corticosteroids (choice B); peeling of the cortical vitreous, epiretinal membrane, or the internal limiting membrane (choice C); or bilateral antivascular endothelial growth factor agents (choice D) result in superior outcomes compared with observation.No treatment was initiated. Five days later, visual acuity improved to 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. The edema no longer was apparent on OCT in either eye, and central subfield thickness was 255 μm OD and 326 μm OS, perhaps associated with the epiretinal membrane causing slight vitreomacular traction. A mild alteration of outer layers was noted in the right eye. After 1 month without any treatment, visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. The external layers of the retina on OCT appeared relatively normal (Figure 2), with persistent thickening in the left eye presumably associated with the epiretinal membrane.After 30 days, optical coherence tomography revealed a complete disappearance of the edema in the right eye.

[Explanation]
In this case, observation (option D) is the most appropriate course of action for several reasons:

1. Etiology: The patient's symptoms are likely due to traumatic macular edema following a car crash. This condition often resolves spontaneously without intervention.

2. Timing: The symptoms occurred only 2 hours after the trauma. It's too early to intervene aggressively, as many cases of traumatic macular edema improve on their own over time.

3. Absence of severe complications: While there is bilateral macular edema, there are no signs of retinal hemorrhages, retinal detachment, or other severe complications that would necessitate immediate intervention.

4. Risk-benefit analysis: Invasive treatments like corticosteroids, anti-VEGF therapy, or surgery carry risks and potential side effects. Given the recent onset and traumatic cause, these risks outweigh the potential benefits at this early stage.

5. Epiretinal membrane: While an epiretinal membrane is noted in the left eye, it's likely pre-existing and unrelated to the trauma. Surgical intervention for this is not urgent and should be considered separately from the acute trauma.

6. Natural history: Traumatic macular edema often improves spontaneously over weeks to months. Observation allows for monitoring of this natural recovery process.

The best approach is to observe the patient closely, scheduling follow-up visits to monitor the macular edema's progression. If the condition persists or worsens over time, then more aggressive treatments can be considered. This conservative approach minimizes unnecessary interventions while allowing for appropriate management if needed in the future.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

While evidence from clinical trials supports the treatment of PDR with1 and without2 CI-DME with either anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) or panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), 1 trial3 in which a subgroup had PDR and DME demonstrated that patients benefited from anti-VEGF monotherapy (compared with PRP combined with anti-VEGF) over 2 years.The European Society of Retina Specialists recommends firstline therapy with anti-VEGF medications, with worse baseline BCVA (<69 letters; Snellen, 20/50 or worse). This is based on the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCRNet) Protocol T study results4,5 describing the relative efficacy and safety of aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab in patients with CI-DME5; each agent was found to have disease-modifying effects.6 Aflibercept was the most effective at improving visual acuity in patients with DME and PDR at baseline6 or worse baseline visual acuity.5 However, patient compliance with anti-VEGF monotherapy can be challenging because of the required visit frequency.7The comparative efficacy of anti-VEGF agents and PRP for the treatment of PDR was investigated in the DRCRNet Protocol S1 and CLARITY studies.2 Similar visual acuity outcomes with ranibizumab or PRP were observed after 5 years in Protocol S.1 CLARITY demonstrated improved visual acuity outcomes with aflibercept than PRP after 52 weeks3; however, participants in CLARITY, unlike this patient, had no baseline DME with visual acuity loss, and participants with eyes that developed DME with visual acuity loss over 1 year received anti-VEGF in the aflibercept arm but laser in the PRP arm, a treatment already shown to be inferior to anti-VEGF for DME. This may have biased results at 1 year, favoring the anti-VEGF arm. While combining anti-VEGF with PRP may benefit patients with whom regular follow-up is unlikely,7 there is little evidence for this in the literature. However, in this patient, whose compliance was questionable, PRP for the PDR and anti-VEGF therapy for the DME was deemed appropriate.The patient received PRP and aflibercept with a protocol similar to Protocol T.5 Aflibercept was administered monthly for 5 months, similar to the Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection in Vision Impairment Due to DME (VIVID-DME) and Study of Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI; EYLEA; BAY86-5321) in Patients With Diabetic Macular Edema (VISTA-DME) trials8 (vs 6 monthly injections in the Protocol T study5), and PRP was performed between the second and fourth aflibercept injections.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step for this patient is intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections combined with laser panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). This combination therapy addresses both the proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) present in this case.

The patient presents with several concerning findings:
1. Substantial loss of visual acuity (BCVA 20/100 OS)
2. Large area of disc neovascularization (>1/3 of disc area)
3. Significant macular edema (CST 805 μm) with cystoid abnormalities and subretinal fluid
4. Considerable retinal thickening and capillary nonperfusion in the macular area

Anti-VEGF injections are crucial for rapidly reducing macular edema and regression of neovascularization. They can improve visual acuity and reduce the risk of vision-threatening complications. The intravitreal injections will target both the macular edema and the neovascularization of the disc.

Laser PRP is essential for long-term management of PDR. It helps to reduce the oxygen demand of the peripheral retina and decreases the production of VEGF, thereby reducing the stimulus for neovascularization. While anti-VEGF injections provide rapid improvement, PRP offers more durable control of PDR.

The combination of these treatments (Option D) provides both immediate and long-term benefits, addressing the multiple aspects of this patient's severe diabetic eye disease.

A diagnosis of autoimmune Isaacs syndrome was made. Mycophenolate mofetil, 1000 mg twice daily, and a tapering dose of prednisone, 60 mg, were prescribed. At the 3-month follow-up, his muscle twitching and skin lesion had subsided. Repeated serum CASPR2-Ab and LGI1-Ab results were negative.Nerve conduction studies show the presence of M-waves after discharges in the posterior tibialis nerve.Needle electromyography results show multiple myokymic discharges in the rectus abdominis.Isaacs syndrome is the most well-known type of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. It was first described in 1961 in 2 patients who presented with persistent generalized muscle stiffness and twitching with needle EMG results demonstrating spontaneous motor unit action potentials.1 Isaacs syndrome is characterized by continuous muscle twitching and myokymia, muscle hypertrophy, weight loss, and hyperhidrosis.2 Spontaneous irregular discharges can be found frequently with typical di, tri, or multiple single motor unit discharges on needle EMG and after-discharges can be found on motor nerve conduction studies.1 Isaacs syndrome can be caused by abnormal autoimmunity, paraneoplastic syndrome,  or genetic conditions.1 Voltage-gated potassium channel–complex antibodies against CASPR2 and LGI1 are essential to the pathophysiology of autoimmune Isaacs syndrome.3Contactin-associated protein-like 2 antibodies have been found to associate with Isaacs syndrome, whereas LGI1-Ab are associated with limbic encephalitis.3 Some patients with positive LGI1-Ab and CASPR2-Ab results may present with different clinical features.4,5Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability is also common in Morvan syndrome. Morvan syndrome is also thought to be associated with positive CASPR2-Ab and LGI1-Ab, which is defined by myokymia or neuromyotonia, dysautonomic symptoms, severe sleep disturbance, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement, such as fluctuating encephalopathy.6 The lack of CNS involvement in this patient makes this condition less likely.Involuntary muscle movements can also can be seen in rippling muscle disease. Rippling muscle disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding caveolin-3, a membrane-associated protein of skeletal muscle fibers. Its clinical features include percussion-induced rapid muscle contractions and involuntary rolling muscle contractions or muscle rippling.7 The hyperirritability originates directly from muscle fibers, not from the peripheral nerve. Electromyography results showed motor unit potential discharges associated with rippling,7 which is different from this case.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also characterized by muscle twitching (fasciculations), weakness, and atrophy with mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs on neurological examination results.8 An EMG study usually shows fasciculations, diffused acute denervation, and compensatory chronic reinnervation in different body regions, which is different from this case.This patient has had psoriasis for 30 years. Patients with LGI1 or CASPR2 antibodies are often found to have other coexistent autoimmune conditions, like psoriasis,9 which may suggest that they have a common autoimmune pathogenesis. In the study by Binks et al,9 4 of 6 patients (66.7%) with psoriasis and VGKC-complex antibodies harbored the psoriasis risk allele. The extended haplotypes may explain the specific comorbidities of positive VGKC-complex antibodies and psoriasis.In summary, there are 2 diagnostic clues from the videos: neuromyotonia is the main feature, and the presence of psoriasis raises the possibility of underlying autoimmune vulnerability.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is Autoimmune Isaacs syndrome, also known as neuromyotonia or Isaacs' syndrome.

The key features supporting this diagnosis are:

1. Persistent muscle twitching: The patient presents with a 2-month history of persistent muscle twitching in the abdomen and bilateral calves, both during wakefulness and sleep. This is characteristic of neuromyotonia, where continuous muscle fiber activity leads to visible fasciculations and myokymia.

2. Excessive sweating: This autonomic symptom is often associated with Isaacs syndrome.

3. Mild bilateral lower extremity weakness: This can occur in Isaacs syndrome due to continuous muscle activity leading to fatigue.

4. Visible undulating wavelike movements on the muscle surface: This description is consistent with myokymia, a hallmark of Isaacs syndrome.

5. Normal laboratory tests: The absence of elevated creatine kinase and normal paraneoplastic antibodies support an autoimmune etiology rather than a primary muscle disease or paraneoplastic syndrome.

6. Absence of cognitive symptoms: The patient denies confusion, memory problems, and hallucinations, which helps differentiate this condition from Morvan syndrome (option C).

While the patient has a history of psoriasis and hypothyroidism, these conditions are not directly related to the presenting symptoms. The normal thyrotropin levels rule out thyroid dysfunction as a cause.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (option A) typically presents with progressive weakness and upper motor neuron signs, which are not prominent in this case. Rippling muscle disease (option D) is a rare genetic disorder that doesn't typically present with the autonomic symptoms seen here.

Therefore, given the characteristic muscle twitching, myokymia, and autonomic symptoms without cognitive involvement, Autoimmune Isaacs syndrome (option B) is the most appropriate diagnosis for this clinical presentation.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Please analyze the following clinical case and the related question:

<clinical_case>
A 42-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of persistent muscle twitching in his abdomen and bilateral calves during wakefulness and sleep accompanied with excessive sweating, as well as mild bilateral lower extremity weakness after prolonged walking. The patient denied confusion, memory problems, hallucinations, and sleep disturbance. He had psoriasis for 30 years, for which he was taking steroids intermittently, and hypothyroidism for 4 years, for which he was taking levothyroxine. His family history was unremarkable. His examination results were significant for psoriatic skin lesions and purple stria in the abdomen and both calves. Undulating wavelike movements were visible on the muscle surface of the abdomen and calves (Video). The remaining general and neurological examination results were normal. Laboratory test results, including creatine kinase, thyrotropin, antinuclear antibodies, paraneoplastic antibodies (includes Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, and amphiphysin antibodies), were normal. Chest computed tomography results were normal.

</options>",6.580026149749756,"content=""B\n\n[Explanation]\nBased on the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is Autoimmune Isaacs syndrome, also known as neuromyotonia or Isaacs' syndrome.\n\nThe key features supporting this diagnosis are:\n\n1. Persistent muscle twitching: The patient presents with a 2-month history of persistent muscle twitching in the abdomen and bilateral calves, both during wakefulness and sleep. This is characteristic of neuromyotonia, where continuous muscle fiber activity leads to visible fasciculations and myokymia.\n\n2. Excessive sweating: This autonomic symptom is often associated with Isaacs syndrome.\n\n3. Mild bilateral lower extremity weakness: This can occur in Isaacs syndrome due to continuous muscle activity leading to fatigue.\n\n4. Visible undulating wavelike movements on the muscle surface: This description is consistent with myokymia, a hallmark of Isaacs syndrome.\n\n5. Normal laboratory tests: The absence of elevated creatine kinase and normal paraneoplastic antibodies support an autoimmune etiology rather than a primary muscle disease or paraneoplastic syndrome.\n\n6. Absence of cognitive symptoms: The patient denies confusion, memory problems, and hallucinations, which helps differentiate this condition from Morvan syndrome (option C).\n\nWhile the patient has a history of psoriasis and hypothyroidism, these conditions are not directly related to the presenting symptoms. The normal thyrotropin levels rule out thyroid dysfunction as a cause.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (option A) typically presents with progressive weakness and upper motor neuron signs, which are not prominent in this case. Rippling muscle disease (option D) is a rare genetic disorder that doesn't typically present with the autonomic symptoms seen here.\n\nTherefore, given the characteristic muscle twitching, myokymia, and autonomic symptoms without cognitive involvement, Autoimmune Isaacs syndrome (option B) is the most appropriate diagnosis for this clinical presentation."" response_metadata={'id': 'msg_vrtx_017DevqUCkSpY5Y4kkj4F8Jj', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 550, 'output_tokens': 443}} id='run-6226d2fc-bb8a-4749-a926-b62f3ee62b25-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 550, 'output_tokens': 443, 'total_tokens': 993}",1.0

He experienced left temporal field loss when lifting heavy objects. He took no medications and denied prior surgery, eye trauma, or pain. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. The only abnormalities on bilateral eye examination were 1+ levels of anterior vitreous cells and trace levels of posterior vitreous cells in the left eye, without vitreous haze, and a left retinal detachment extending from 1:30 to 10:00 o’clock, with macular involvement and without visible retinal tears. There were 360° left choroidal detachments.Optical coherence tomography showed choroidal thickening in both maculae. Fluorescein angiography (FA) of the right eye gave normal results. Figure 1A depicts the FA image of the left eye. On B-scan ultrasonography, there was a subclinical choroidal detachment superonasally in the right eye. An ultrasonographic image confirmed the detachments in the left eye (Figure 1B). The findings of a prior magnetic resonance image of the brain, chest radiographic image, and computed tomographic image of the chest were unremarkable.

The maximum height of the choroidal detachment was 3.4 mm. No retinal tear was visualized.The patient started receiving 60 mg of oral prednisone  daily. Three weeks later, his best-corrected visual acuity worsened to 20/50 OS. A posterior sub-Tenon injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone acetonide was given, along with tapering doses of oral prednisone for 6 more weeks. There was further decline in visual acuity to 20/60 OS and worsening subretinal fluid. What Would You Do Next?",Diagnostic vitrectomy with cytologic testing,Surgery to create scleral windows,Surgery to create a scleral buckle,Immunosuppressive therapy,Type 3 uveal effusion syndrome,B,Surgery to create scleral windows,"Diagnostic vitrectomy with cytologic testing (choice A) would be appropriate for suspected primary vitreoretinal lymphoma with so-called leopard-spot lymphomatous infiltration under the retinal pigment epithelium, but there were few vitreous cells seen in this case. Choroidal thickening and exudation might occur in choroidal lymphoma, but this diagnosis would likely require tissue biopsy rather than vitreous biopsy.Rhegmatogenous detachment should always be reconsidered when presumed exudative detachments do not resolve with initial treatment. Surgical repair with a scleral buckle (choice C) would then be appropriate. However, this patient had repeated fundus examinations and ultrasonographic images that did not reveal retinal tears. Also, there was no vitreous pigment and no stiffening of the retina.Noncorticosteroid systemic immunosuppressive therapy (choice D) is not preferred, because there was insufficient intraocular inflammation to explain the exudation. In addition, no improvement had occurred with high-dose systemic or regional corticosteroid administration.The diagnosis of uveal effusion syndrome (UES) was made based on these considerations, along with clinical features of combined choroidal and retinal detachments, leopard-spot pigmentation on FA, and exclusion of rhegmatogenous detachment, malignant conditions, and inflammatory disease, to the extent possible. In UES, abnormal transscleral protein outflow hypothetically results in extravascular choroidal protein accumulation,1 which leads to exudative retinal and choroidal detachments.2 With long-term fluid accumulation, retinal pigment epithelium hypertrophy and hyperplasia can occur, causing a leopard-spot pattern visible by FA.Uveal effusion syndrome has been divided into 3 types.3 Type 1 involves nanophthalmic eyes with short axial lengths and hypermetropia. Type 2 involves nonnanophthalmic eyes with disorganized, glycosaminoglycan-laden sclera.4 Type 3 is characterized by nonnanophthalmic eyes with histologically normal sclera. Type 3 may or may not respond to oral or local corticosteroids5 and scleral windows.3This patient had a normal axial length of 22 mm, consistent with type 3 UES; he did not respond to corticosteroids. He therefore underwent a procedure to create scleral windows (choice B) in the 2 inferior quadrants of the left eye. The 2 excised 4 × 3 × 1-mm scleral flaps were normal morphologically, without abnormal Alcian blue staining. Postoperatively, serial ultrasonographic images documented slow resolution of the subretinal fluid (Figure 2). Thirteen months after the scleral window procedure, the patient’s best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OS.A B-scan ultrasonographic image of the left eye 9 months after scleral window surgery. In this longitudinal 6 o’clock–hour meridian scan, choroidal detachments have resolved. Trace subretinal fluid persists between 4 o’clock and half past 8 o’clock. There was no submacular fluid. The apparent vitreous opacities are associated with the gain setting of the instrument; vitreous haze or cells were not present clinically.Type 3 UES is a diagnosis of exclusion. Although corticosteroids are a useful first step, a response may indicate inflammatory disease rather than UES. Worsening after corticosteroid use might suggest central serous retinopathy, which can be excluded in this case based on the angiographic scan appearance. This patient with type 3 UES did not improve with oral and periocular steroid therapy, but he did experience resolution after the creation of scleral windows, confirming the diagnosis: scleral windows are a selective treatment to correct the impaired transscleral outflow that is presumed to be the common factor in UES.Surgery for UES was initially conceptualized as a decompression of the vortex veins.1,6 Surgical technique has recently been reviewed.7 Scleral thinning appears to be the essential intervention. More windows, deeper flaps, full-thickness punch sclerotomies, or mitomycin C use to prevent scarring may increase efficacy. Recurrence may occur in about one-quarter of patients, so continued observation is crucial.6,7",Ophthalmology,2019-07-01,2019,7,"A 45-year-old man presented with floaters in his left eye and headaches for 2 months.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and the progression of the patient's condition, immunosuppressive therapy (option D) appears to be the most appropriate next step.

The patient presents with a complex case of uveitis, characterized by vitreous cells, retinal detachment, and choroidal detachments in the left eye, with some subclinical involvement in the right eye. The fluorescein angiography findings, including punctate hyperfluorescence and a leopard-spot pattern, are suggestive of an inflammatory process.

The initial treatment with oral prednisone and a posterior sub-Tenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide failed to improve the patient's condition. In fact, the visual acuity worsened from 20/30 to 20/60 OS, and there was an increase in subretinal fluid. This poor response to corticosteroids indicates that a more aggressive immunosuppressive approach is warranted.

Immunosuppressive therapy can help control the underlying inflammatory process that is likely causing the retinal and choroidal detachments. This approach may include agents such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, or biologics like adalimumab, which can provide more potent and sustained immunosuppression than corticosteroids alone.

The other options are less suitable:
A. Diagnostic vitrectomy: While this could provide additional information, the clinical picture is already strongly suggestive of an inflammatory process, and further invasive procedures may not be necessary at this stage.
B. Surgery to create scleral windows: This is not typically indicated for inflammatory choroidal detachments and would not address the underlying cause.
C. Surgery to create a scleral buckle: This is more appropriate for rhegmatogenous retinal detachments, which is not the case here as no retinal tears were visualized.

Therefore, given the inflammatory nature of the condition and the failure of initial corticosteroid therapy, immunosuppressive therapy is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Combined hamartomas are most commonly seen without any syndromic associations; however, neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is most commonly reported among its associated syndromes.1 Therefore, affected patients should be screened for central nervous system abnormalities with magnetic resonance imaging and referred to medical genetics (choice B). Young patients will often not meet diagnostic criteria for NF2, but they can be monitored prospectively if a combined hamartoma is identified or other clinical suspicion is raised. Genetic screening for NF2 is available; however, this can be negative in 25% to 30% of founder cases owing to somatic mosaicism.2In 1973, Gass3 described the clinical features of 7 patients with combined hamartoma of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium. Core features include an elevated, pigmented retinal mass with thickened retinal and epiretinal tissue with contraction of the inner surface resulting in surrounding retinal traction toward the lesion. Since the initial descriptions, 3 large case series have been published: Schachat et al4 in 1984, Font et al5 in 1989, and Shields et al6 in 2008. Based on these series, the most common presenting symptoms are decreased visual acuity and strabismus, although a significant percentage of patients are asymptomatic and lesions may be discovered incidentally. Most combined hamartomas are found in male patients with Schachat et al4 reporting 51.6%, Font et al5 reporting 70%, and Shields et al6 reporting 68%. Visual acuity and prognosis are worse in patients with combined hamartoma involving the macula. Patients with combined hamartoma commonly have retinal traction (81%), retinal fibrosis (46%), epiretinal membrane (57%), and foveal dragging (77%).6 Shields et al6 reported that all 39 eyes with a combined hamartoma located in the macula had an epiretinal membrane and foveal dragging. Retinal or choroidal neovascularization is rare. There is no consensus regarding the benefit of surgical treatment. Clinicians can consider vitrectomy with membrane peeling on an individual case basis with the patient. Amblyopia treatment is recommended and dependent on patient age.Recognition of combined hamartoma is critical, as these large pigmented lesions can simulate choroidal melanoma. Indeed, there are reports in the early literature of eyes being enucleated with combined hamartomas over concern for malignant neoplasm, primarily choroidal melanoma.7-9 Although combined hamartomas are benign lesions, they may show minimal enlargement in some cases. Clinical examination, along with optical coherence tomography can accurately localize combined hamartomas to allow clinical distinction from choroidal melanoma and obviate the need for plaque brachytherapy or enucleation (choice A). There are reports in the literature of reactive hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium that appear clinically and histologically similar to combined hamartoma.10 There is no literature supporting a viral or inflammatory etiology of combined hamartomas, making antiviral therapy (choice D) and oral corticosteroids (choice C) unnecessary. The occurrence of combined hamartoma with renal disease in our patient is likely coincidental.Magnetic resonance imaging showed no intracranial abnormalities.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and a medical genetics evaluation.

The patient presents with unilateral vision loss, a large macular mass, and optic disc pallor in the right eye. These findings, along with the absence of systemic symptoms like hearing loss or skin lesions, are suggestive of a possible retinal astrocytic hamartoma or other retinal tumor.

An MRI of the brain is crucial for several reasons:
1. It can help rule out intracranial involvement or extension of the retinal mass.
2. It can detect any associated brain lesions that might be part of a neurocutaneous syndrome.
3. It can provide more detailed information about the nature and extent of the retinal mass.

A medical genetics evaluation is warranted because:
1. Some retinal tumors, such as astrocytic hamartomas, can be associated with genetic syndromes like tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).
2. Even though the patient doesn't have typical signs of TSC (like skin lesions), a thorough genetic workup can help identify any underlying genetic conditions.

The other options are less appropriate:
- A vitreous tap with antiviral injection (Option A) is not indicated as there are no signs of viral retinitis.
- Plaque brachytherapy or enucleation (Option B) would be too aggressive at this stage without a definitive diagnosis.
- Oral corticosteroids (Option C) are not appropriate without a clear inflammatory etiology.

In summary, ordering an MRI and genetic evaluation provides the most comprehensive approach to diagnose and manage this complex case, guiding further treatment decisions.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

What Would You Do Next?",Aspiration with absolute alcohol injection,Surgical resection,Continued monitoring,Laser cystotomy,Iris stromal cyst,A,Aspiration with absolute alcohol injection,"Pigmented cysts arising from the iris pigment epithelium are the most common type of primary iris cyst.1 They are often of no visual consequence and typically do not require intervention.1 However, iris stromal cysts are likely to enlarge with distortion of surrounding structures and potential consequences of compromised vision, amblyopia, recurrent iridocyclitis, and glaucoma.2,3 Stromal cysts represent approximately 3% of iris tumors, and approximately 40% of iris stromal cysts are congenital.4 Congenital cysts are typically diagnosed in patients younger than 20 years.4In this case, continued observation was not ideal given the extension into the visual axis and the significant growth over the course of 1 month. Aspiration,3 alcohol sclerosis,5,6 resection,7 and laser treatment8 have all been described; however, we believe aspiration with alcohol sclerosis is the preferred initial approach given that it is less invasive than surgical resection and potentially less inflammatory and less likely to yield recurrence than laser cystotomy.Complete resection with sector iridectomy was advocated for congenital iris cysts by Capó and colleagues7 after comparison with injection of trichloroacetic acid and xenon photocoagulation. However, owing to its adverse effect profile, surgical resection is often regarded as a treatment of last resort after failure of more conservative interventions.3 Gupta and colleagues8 reported 2 cases of laser cystotomy using Nd:YAG laser to puncture the cyst wall and allow the cyst’s contents to drain into the anterior chamber. One of the 2 cases demonstrated a recurrence, which was treated successfully with Nd:YAG laser. Allowing cyst material to drain into the anterior chamber may result in inflammatory sequelae, such as peripheral anterior synechiae and epithelial downgrowth from the cyst lining.9Of the treatments mentioned above, aspiration with absolute alcohol injection to allow damage to the epithelial cell lining of the cyst, as initially described by Behrouzi and Khodadoust,6 has substantial support in the literature.5 Shields and colleagues5 described a case series of 16 iris stromal cysts treated with aspiration and absolute alcohol sclerosis. All cysts in their series had recurred after prior simple aspiration. In 15 patients with adequate follow-up, 13 cysts involuted and 1 stabilized in size. Visual acuity was stable or improved in 14 patients. Treatment failed in only 1 patient in the series, later requiring surgical resection of the cyst.5 The most common complications included transient corneal edema and anterior chamber inflammation, which resolved in association with topical corticosteroid therapy.The patient underwent aspiration and absolute alcohol injection with improvement in the size of the cyst (Figure 2).10 Initial treatment was followed by a second aspiration 2 months later with improved visual acuity to 20/20.

[Explanation]
Surgical resection is the most appropriate next step in this case. Here's why:

1. Progressive nature: The lesion has shown significant growth over a short period (1 month), increasing from 2.2 mm to 3.5 mm in thickness and now extending into the visual axis.

2. Symptomatic deterioration: The patient's symptoms have worsened, with increased photophobia and a decline in visual acuity from 20/20 to 20/50 OS.

3. Impact on vision: The cyst's extension into the visual axis is directly affecting the patient's vision, necessitating intervention to prevent further visual impairment.

4. Characteristics of the lesion: The cyst is described as clear, intrinsically vascularized, and cystic, suggesting it might be an epithelial implantation cyst or a primary iris cyst. These types of cysts often require complete excision to prevent recurrence.

5. Limitations of other options:
   - Aspiration with alcohol injection (A) carries a risk of recurrence and may not be effective for a vascularized cyst.
   - Laser cystotomy (B) might provide temporary relief but is likely insufficient for a growing, vascularized cyst and carries a risk of recurrence.
   - Continued monitoring (D) is no longer appropriate given the rapid growth and visual impairment.

Surgical resection offers the best chance for complete removal of the cyst, addressing the visual symptoms, and preventing further complications. It allows for histopathological examination of the tissue and has the lowest risk of recurrence compared to other treatment options.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Therefore, thyroid function was not tested as the next step. An orbital venous varix can present as an enhancing orbital mass that distends with increased venous pressure. It typically presents with an intermittent, reversible proptosis. These conditions have no known association with pituitary dysfunction and infundibular stalk thickening. Therefore, the orbital and pituitary findings are  not consistent with venous varix and Doppler ultrasonography would not be helpful. Histiocytosis, lymphoma, and sarcoidosis would all be in the differential for stalk lesions and bilateral orbital enhancing masses. Chest computed tomography (CT) would not be able to distinguish between these entities and therefore an orbital biopsy was judged as the next procedure to perform.The orbital biopsy results showed xanthogranulomatous inflammation with fibrosis that was positive for CD68, confirming the presence of histiocytes, which was negative for S-100. BRAF test results on the biopsy sample were positive for the V600E mutation. Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)/CT showed multiple areas of intense, abnormal uptake involving multiple bones, bilateral retrobulbar orbital masses, and intense uptake in 2 regions of the right side of the heart. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD).Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare non-Langerhans histiocytosis, with only approximately 500 cases diagnosed since 1930.1 There is a slight male predilection, and the mean age at diagnosis is 53 years.2 It is characterized by multiorgan involvement, particularly of the long bones and the kidneys (ie, hairy kidney). Cardiac involvement occurs via pericardial or myocardial infiltration, and diabetes insipidus is an early sign of the involvement of the hypothalamic pituitary-axis.3 Orbital involvement can occur in up to 25% of cases4 and typically presents as painless, progressive, bilateral proptosis and, in later stages, decreased central vision.The diagnosis of ECD is made by histopathology, with associated clinical and radiologic findings. The characteristic pattern is xanthogranulomatous infiltration with CD68-positive and CD1a-negative histiocytes and an absence of S-100 proteins.5 The histiocytes can be found in almost all tissues in patients with ECD.Head and neck imaging results typically reveal bilateral, enhancing intraconal orbital masses. The lesions are infiltrative and replace the orbital fat. The intraconal lesions are hypointense on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and are enhanced with gadolinium administration.3 The hypothalamic-pituitary axis is the most commonly affected site in the central nervous system and presents on imaging results with a thickening of the pituitary stalk.3Treatment options for ECD vary depending on the site of involvement and symptoms. Steroids and cytotoxic agents, once the only treatment options, showed only minimal improvement. Orbital debulking is associated with an overall poor response and continued progression despite further attempted systemic treatment.4 External beam radiation therapy as a palliative treatment for associated pain provides a limited duration of relief.6 More recent studies have shown benefits with interferon and pegylated interferon, except for patients with severe multisystem ECD.7 Recent promising results have been reported with BRAF inhibitors.8The patient was initially treated with pegylated interferon but developed bacteremia from a urinary tract infection. Three months after initiating treatment, PET/CT results showed only minimal improvement in orbital masses while there was disease progression in the pararenal spaces and bones. Pegylated interferon was discontinued and she was prescribed dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor. Three months later, orbital MRI results showed substantial improvement in the soft tissue masses and PET/CT results showed diminished hypermetabolism in all previously affected organs.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and imaging findings, obtaining thyroid function test results or an endocrine evaluation would be the most appropriate next step for this patient.

The patient's history and current symptoms suggest a complex endocrine disorder:

1. History of diabetes insipidus, which is often associated with pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction.
2. Previous MRI findings showing thickening and enhancement of the pituitary gland, stalk, and hypothalamus, which improved without treatment.
3. Current bilateral orbital masses with proptosis and extraocular motility deficits.

These findings raise suspicion for a systemic inflammatory or infiltrative process that affects both the pituitary-hypothalamic axis and the orbits. One of the most likely diagnoses to consider is lymphocytic hypophysitis with orbital involvement, which can be associated with other autoimmune endocrine disorders.

Thyroid dysfunction, particularly Graves' disease, can also present with similar orbital findings (thyroid eye disease). Although the patient's orbital masses are atypical for thyroid eye disease, it's crucial to rule out thyroid dysfunction as a potential contributing factor.

An endocrine evaluation would help to:
1. Assess pituitary function, including anterior and posterior pituitary hormones.
2. Evaluate thyroid function and screen for thyroid autoantibodies.
3. Check for other potential autoimmune endocrine disorders that might be associated with this presentation.

This evaluation will provide essential information to guide further management and potentially identify the underlying cause of the patient's condition before considering more invasive procedures like a biopsy.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

His ocular history included nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye requiring pars plana vitrectomy, panretinal photocoagulation, multiple treatments with intravitreous bevacizumab, and cataract extraction with placement of an intraocular lens (IOL) into the capsular bag approximately 4 years ago. At his routine follow-up visit 2 weeks prior, the proliferative diabetic retinopathy was quiescent, and his Snellen visual acuity was 20/20 OD with manifest refraction of −1.50 + 0.25 × 180. Examination of the anterior segment at that time was unremarkable.At his current visit, visual acuity with the previous correction had been reduced to 20/150. Repeated manifest refraction of the right eye was −4.00 + 1.50 × 166, resulting in a visual acuity of 20/25. Intraocular pressure of the right eye was 10 mm Hg by Goldmann applanation tonometry.

Anterior segment OCT confirmed the diagnosis. Performing a posterior capsulotomy would allow egress of the turbid material into the vitreous cavity and provide immediate resolution of the refractive change with minimal risk. If this was not successful, we would then perform a posterior capsulotomy during pars plana vitrectomy (choice A). Exchanging the IOL (choice C) is not preferred because decreasing the new lens power to compensate for the myopic shift would result in a hyperopic surprise, as the procedure itself would resolve the capsular bag distention syndrome (CBDS). Observation (choice D) is preferable when the patient does not want intervention; however, the myopic shift needs to be corrected with an updated manifest refraction.Capsular bag distention syndrome, also known as capsular block syndrome, is a rare complication after phacoemulsification and placement of an IOL into the capsular bag.1,2 It is characterized by the accumulation of opaque fluid within the potential space between the posterior aspect of the IOL and the intact posterior capsule. Capsular bag distention syndrome is classified as intraoperative, early-onset, or late-onset on the basis of time of onset.3 Intraoperative CBDS occurs with lens luxation following hydrodissection. Early-onset CBDS is associated with retained viscoelastic materials. Late-onset CBDS is caused by residual cortical cells secreting alpha-crystallin proteins, which creates a turbid milieu that slowly accumulates and distends the posterior capsule.4 Patients with diabetes are not at increased risk for this syndrome. Although intraoperative and early-onset forms of CBDS are often associated with high intraocular pressure and shallowing of the anterior chamber, these features may be absent in the late-onset form.5 This patient presented with late-onset CBDS, demonstrating symptomatic visual acuity decline approximately 4 years after cataract surgery.Although CBDS can be diagnosed clinically, the value of using anterior segment OCT has been previously reported.6 The combination of increased refractive index of the turbid milieu along with convex configuration of the hyperdistended capsular bag forms a plus lens effect that causes a myopic shift, as experienced by this patient.Capsular bag distention syndrome can often be treated with Nd:YAG laser–assisted posterior capsulotomy, as this quick in-office procedure evacuates the turbid milieu from the capsular bag and resolves symptoms almost immediately.5,7 When an infectious etiology, in particular Propionibacterium acnes, is suspected, use of pars plana vitrectomy is necessary to surgically remove the contents of the bag, along with possible IOL exchange and/or injection of intraocular antibiotics.8,9 In this patient, there were no clinical findings of intraocular inflammation or capsular plaques to suggest infection.This patient underwent uneventful Nd:YAG laser–assisted posterior capsulotomy of the right eye; 1 hour after the procedure, the intraocular pressure was 11 mm Hg by applanation. Within 10 minutes after the procedure, the patient reported noticeably improved distance vision in the right eye. Repeated manifest refraction showed resolution of the myopic shift.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a posterior capsulotomy with Nd:YAG laser (Option C).

The patient's sudden-onset blurry vision, significant myopic shift (from -1.50 to -4.00), and the OCT imaging of the anterior segment strongly suggest capsular block syndrome (CBS). This condition occurs when the posterior capsule adheres to the back of the intraocular lens (IOL), trapping fluid between the IOL and the posterior capsule. This trapped fluid causes the capsular bag to distend posteriorly, effectively pushing the IOL forward and inducing a myopic shift.

The OCT image described (although not visible in this format) likely shows hyperdistention of the capsular bag with turbid fluid, which is characteristic of CBS.

Performing a posterior capsulotomy with Nd:YAG laser is the standard treatment for CBS. This procedure creates an opening in the posterior capsule, allowing the trapped fluid to escape into the vitreous cavity. This should resolve the myopic shift and improve the patient's vision.

Option A (exchanging the IOL) is too invasive at this stage and unnecessary if CBS is the cause. Option B (observation) is not appropriate given the sudden vision change and refractive shift. Option D (posterior capsulotomy as part of pars plana vitrectomy) is overly invasive for this condition, as CBS can typically be managed with a less invasive Nd:YAG laser procedure.

The Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy is a quick, outpatient procedure that carries lower risks compared to more invasive surgical options, making it the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

These scotomas localize to the junction of the optic nerve and chiasm and are not compatible with the diagnosis of glaucoma. The most frequent cause of junctional syndrome is pituitary adenoma,1 but it has also been reported in trauma, substance abuse, infection, inflammatory disease such as sarcoidosis or multiple sclerosis, meningioma, or aneurysm.2-4 Any patient with a junctional scotoma should undergo magnetic resonance imaging  of the optic chiasm.Observation and repeating visual fields in 1 month (options A and D) are not appropriate because mass lesions, including pituitary apoplexy and aneurysm, frequently cause chiasmal syndrome and would require urgent treatment.

Deficits in pyruvate dehydrogenase lead to a decrease in aerobic respiration causing lactic acidosis and an increase in plasma concentrations of pyruvate. Owing to the high metabolic demand of the central nervous system tissue, neurologic manifestations of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency include peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, and seizures.5 Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare cause of optic neuropathy, and to our knowledge, there have only been 2 cases of optic neuropathy reported owing to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency.6,7 Similar to our case, both of these patients had ocular motility deficits with stable vision for many years before their acute visual loss owing to optic neuropathy. Owing to the rarity of patients surviving with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency to adulthood, there are no treatments that have been proven in prospective trials, but case reports have suggested that there are a subset of patients who respond to thiamine supplementation,8 activators of pyruvate dehydrogenase such as dichloroacetate,9 or a ketogenic diet.10Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain did not reveal abnormalities of the optic nerves or chiasm but did demonstrate atrophy of the cerebellum.

Given the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits. Here's why:

1. Atypical glaucoma presentation: While the patient has been diagnosed with glaucoma, several features of this case are atypical for primary open-angle glaucoma. These include the patient's relatively young age (52), normal intraocular pressure (16 mm Hg OU), and the presence of optic nerve pallor in addition to cupping.

2. Visual field defects: The visual field defects described (temporal hemianopia respecting the vertical midline in the left eye with cecocentral scotoma in the right eye, consistent with a junctional scotoma) are highly suggestive of a chiasmal lesion rather than glaucomatous field loss.

3. Neurological symptoms: The patient's history of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency and episodic neurological symptoms (hand tremors, ataxia, and dysarthria) raise concern for a potential neurological cause of his visual symptoms.

4. Optic nerve appearance: The presence of optic nerve pallor in both eyes, along with a supratemporal optic nerve pit in the right eye, warrants further investigation of potential compressive or infiltrative optic neuropathy.

5. Rule out compressive lesions: An MRI would help rule out compressive lesions such as pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, or other space-occupying lesions that could affect the optic chiasm and explain the visual field defects.

6. Evaluate for white matter changes: Given the patient's metabolic disorder, an MRI could also reveal any white matter changes or other brain abnormalities that might be contributing to his visual and neurological symptoms.

An MRI of the brain and orbits would provide crucial information to guide further management and potentially revise the diagnosis.

It is classically described as an orange-red tumor, usually in the posterior pole.1 Circumscribed choroidal hemangioma is usually diagnosed when it is causing visual disturbance from exudative retinal detachment. Circumscribed choroidal hemangioma can be treated by a variety of methods including photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, external beam radiotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy, proton beam radiotherapy, episcleral plaque radiotherapy, and transpupillary thermotherapy PDT.2The results of PDT for CCH are very favorable; however, the exact treatment regimen of PDT for CCH varies depending on lesion size and location. In 2 studies of PDT in CCH, tumor thickness ranged from 1.9 mm to 5.9 mm (smaller than in this patient) and thicker lesions are less responsive to PDT or require more sessions.2,3 Diffuse choroidal hemangiomas and those associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome can achieve similar thicknesses, but it is unusual for true circumscribed lesions to be this thick. Additionally, placement of an intravenous catheter, infusion of verteporfin, and multiple sessions of laser with a slitlamp delivery system would be challenging for a 13-year-old patient (choice A).Bevacizumab has been recently reported as an option for CCH treatment.4,5 Tumor thickness was not reported, but laser photocoagulation was used as adjunctive therapy for each patient. Sagong et al5 reported a case series of 3 patients receiving intravitreal bevacizumab injections as primary treatment for CCH. The tumor thickness of these patients ranged from 1.6 mm to 2.6 mm. Of note, each of these patients were also given adjunctive PDT. Bevacizumab injections were not an option in our case owing to the need for adjunctive therapy with either PDT or thermal laser, which as described above would have proved infeasible. Additionally, a tumor thickness of 6.5 mm has not been studied with bevacizumab, to our knowledge (choice C).Schilling et al6 published a case series of 36 eyes treated with external beam radiation for the treatment of CCH. The age of the patients ranged from 22 to 66 years. Of the tumors that received external beam radiotherapy without laser photocoagulation, none showed tumor regression on ultrasonography. In addition, Harbron et al7 published a series of 7257 children receiving external beam radiotherapy, of which 42 secondary malignant neoplasms were diagnosed. Although external beam radiotherapy may have been effective in this case, the risk of secondary malignant neoplasm outweighed benefit (choice D).Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is successfully used to treat many tumors of the retina and choroid.

[Explanation]
Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is the most appropriate next step for this patient based on the clinical presentation and characteristics of the choroidal mass.

The case describes a progressive choroidal mass in a 13-year-old boy, which has several features suggestive of a choroidal hemangioma:
1. Orange, subretinal mass
2. Associated subretinal fluid
3. Progressive growth and worsening visual acuity
4. Large size (15 mm basal diameter, 6.4 mm thickness)

Choroidal hemangiomas, especially when symptomatic and progressive, require treatment to prevent further vision loss and potential complications. Among the given options, Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is the most suitable treatment for the following reasons:

1. Effectiveness: Plaque brachytherapy has been shown to be highly effective in treating choroidal hemangiomas, especially for larger lesions like the one described in this case.

2. Tumor size: The large size of the tumor (15 mm basal diameter) makes it an ideal candidate for plaque brachytherapy, which can effectively treat tumors of this size.

3. Localized treatment: Brachytherapy allows for a localized, targeted treatment that minimizes radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissues.

4. Long-term control: This treatment modality offers good long-term tumor control and potential improvement in visual acuity.

5. Single treatment: Unlike some other options, plaque brachytherapy typically requires only a single treatment session, which is beneficial for the young patient.

While the other options (photodynamic therapy, external beam radiotherapy, and anti-VEGF injections) can be used in some cases of choroidal hemangioma, they are less suitable for this particular case due to the tumor's size and progression. Plaque brachytherapy offers the best chance for tumor control and potential visual improvement in this scenario.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Orange, subretinal mass\n2. Associated subretinal fluid\n3. Progressive growth and worsening visual acuity\n4. Large size (15 mm basal diameter, 6.4 mm thickness)\n\nChoroidal hemangiomas, especially when symptomatic and progressive, require treatment to prevent further vision loss and potential complications. Among the given options, Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is the most suitable treatment for the following reasons:\n\n1. Effectiveness: Plaque brachytherapy has been shown to be highly effective in treating choroidal hemangiomas, especially for larger lesions like the one described in this case.\n\n2. Tumor size: The large size of the tumor (15 mm basal diameter) makes it an ideal candidate for plaque brachytherapy, which can effectively treat tumors of this size.\n\n3. Localized treatment: Brachytherapy allows for a localized, targeted treatment that minimizes radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissues.\n\n4. Long-term control: This treatment modality offers good long-term tumor control and potential improvement in visual acuity.\n\n5. Single treatment: Unlike some other options, plaque brachytherapy typically requires only a single treatment session, which is beneficial for the young patient.\n\nWhile the other options (photodynamic therapy, external beam radiotherapy, and anti-VEGF injections) can be used in some cases of choroidal hemangioma, they are less suitable for this particular case due to the tumor's size and progression.

The patient was clinically diagnosed with a superficial conjunctival lymphatic venous malformation, and he elected for observation.An excisional biopsy of the lesion (choice B) would not be the preferred next step because it is important to define the extent of the lesion prior to surgical intervention. While the patient lacked orbital symptoms and the lesion appeared superficial, lymphatic venous malformations are commonly multifocal and have deep components that must be assessed. Needle drainage of the lesion (choice C) would similarly not be the most appropriate next step without defining the lesion’s extent, and it is associated with a high likelihood of recurrence.1 Systemic propranolol (choice D) would not be the preferred choice because, while propranolol is commonly used to treat capillary hemangiomas in young children and infants, its use in older children and adults with vascular and lymphatic malformations is not well described and may not be as efficacious.2Lymphatic venous malformations (LVMs), or lymphangiomas, are benign, hamartomatous, vascular lesions that may present in the orbit or adnexa. They represent no-flow or low-flow system of cystlike channels lined by endothelial cells of lymphatic or venous origin. The distinction between lymphatic and venous malformations may not be clinically relevant because many lesions demonstrate a mixture of both cell types.3 The cystic spaces may be filled with blood, as in this case. They are typically present from birth and may remain stable or gradually enlarge, but orbital lesions may present with sudden proptosis owing to spontaneous hemorrhage.4 In classic cases, these lesions tend to swell when respiratory infections occur.Lymphatic venous malformations can be divided into superficial, deep, and combined, based on location. Superficial LVMs involving only the eyelid and/or conjunctiva, as in this patient, are the least common subtype.4 Superficial LVMs tend to be of cosmetic importance only and are commonly asymptomatic. Deep and combined LVMs demonstrate orbital involvement and represent most cases. Therefore, orbital imaging is important for evaluation and management. Magnetic resonance and computed tomographic imaging demonstrate multiloculated, heterogeneous masses with cystic spaces.5 Lymphatic venous malformations may be similar in appearance to other benign lesions, such as orbital varices, capillary hemangiomas, and cavernous hemangiomas. Variation of lesion size with the Valsalva maneuver and head positioning may be useful in distinguishing LVMs from orbital varices. Capillary hemangiomas may be present from birth but would be expected to regress over time. Diagnosis of LVM can be confirmed with histopathologic analysis, but a biopsy has the potential to cause excessive bleeding6 and would not likely change the patient’s management.Asymptomatic LVMs may be observed for growth or symptoms. Symptoms depend on lesion location and may include poor cosmesis, proptosis, pain, diplopia, and headache. In case of symptoms, the most commonly described treatment for orbital and adnexal LVMs is surgical resection. However, total resection often proves difficult because the lesions are prone to bleeding,5 and there is a high rate of recurrence with surgical excision.7 Furthermore, it is often not possible to fully resect the lesion.7 Therefore, if the patient is asymptomatic, it is generally recommended to choose observation.The patient has been observed without intervention.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits.

The patient presents with a congenital, painless, vascular mass in the lateral conjunctiva of the right eye, which has been stable since birth. The characteristics of the lesion - being vascular, multifocal, and involving both bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva - suggest a possible diagnosis of orbital lymphangioma or orbital venous-lymphatic malformation.

An MRI of the brain and orbits is crucial for several reasons:

1. Extent of the lesion: MRI can help determine the full extent of the lesion, which may not be entirely visible on external examination. This is particularly important as the mass involves both bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva, suggesting it may extend deeper into the orbit.

2. Tissue characterization: MRI can provide detailed information about the composition of the mass, helping to differentiate between various types of vascular malformations or other orbital masses.

3. Orbital and intracranial involvement: Given the congenital nature of the lesion, it's important to rule out any associated orbital or intracranial abnormalities that may not be clinically apparent.

4. Surgical planning: If intervention is deemed necessary in the future, MRI findings will be crucial for surgical planning.

5. Non-invasive: MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality, which is preferable as the first step in evaluating a stable, longstanding lesion.

The other options are less appropriate at this stage:

A. Excisional biopsy is premature without first understanding the full extent and nature of the lesion through imaging.
B. Systemic propranolol is typically used for infantile hemangiomas, which is not the likely diagnosis given the patient's age and lesion characteristics.
D. Needle drainage could potentially cause complications without a clear understanding of the lesion's nature and extent.

Intermittent exotropia alone can occur from any of the entities mentioned, but only in a case of ocular neuromyotonia will there be an intermittent ocular misalignment after prolonged activity of the extraocular muscle innervated by the affected ocular motor cranial nerve. Symptomatic ocular neuromyotonia is treated medically, with the first-line treatment being carbamazepine (choice A), a voltage-gated sodium-channel blocker.2,3 Bilateral lateral rectus recessions (choice B) is not indicated for ocular neuromyotonia. Although most cases of acquired diplopia in a young person warrant neuroimaging, the history of γ-knife radiosurgery and eye movement findings consistent with ocular neuromyotonia obviated the need for a magnetic resonance imaging study (choice C). Checking anti-acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies (choice D) is not necessary, because myasthenia gravis does not cause an ocular deviation and limitation of eye movements after prolonged activity of a particular extraocular muscle.Ocular neuromyotonia was first described by E. Clark, MD, in 1966 in a patient with spasm of the superior oblique muscle, but it was K. Ricker and H. G. Mertens who coined the term in 1970.1,4 It is believed to be neurogenic in origin and specifically owing to ephaptic neural transmission (ie, lateral contact between nerve fibers allowing action potentials to travel between cell membranes instead of crossing synapses).1,2 Diplopic episodes are triggered by activation of the affected ocular motor cranial nerve, resulting in continued contraction of the innervated extraocular muscle with disruption of the Sherrington law of reciprocal innervation, leading to ocular misalignment and eye movement limitation opposite to the direction of the contracted extraocular muscle.Ocular neuromyotonia is a rare condition and has been most frequently associated with prior radiation therapy.4 However, γ-knife radiosurgery, which this patient received, has been previously documented in only 6 cases, to our knowledge.3,5 Giardina et al6 reviewed 66 cases published in the literature and found a female predominance (61.1%), with a mean age of 43.9 (range, 7-74) years. Fifty-seven percent of the cases involved the third cranial nerve, 39% the sixth cranial nerve, and 9.1% the fourth cranial nerve. The most common underlying pathologic mechanism was a suprasellar mass (60%), followed by an idiopathic origin (19.7%) and an association with thyroid dysfunction (4.5%). Of the suprasellar mass cases, 76.9% had therapeutic radiation exposure. Other less common conditions reported with ocular neuromyotonia included cranial trauma, thorium toxicity, Paget disease, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, central nervous system demyelination, botulinum neurotoxin injection, vitamin D deficiency, stroke, and cataract surgery.6,7The initial evaluation of any patient suspected of ocular neuromyotonia should begin with a detailed history specifically of prior radiation therapy. Misinterpreting the clinical findings can lead to unnecessary investigations, avoidable medical expenses, and inappropriate surgical intervention.The patient was prescribed 200 mg of carbamazepine twice a day, with the option to increase the dosage by 200 mg each week, going no higher than 1200 mg per day depending on the frequency of the double vision.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to initiate a trial of carbamazepine (Option D). The patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of superior oblique myokymia, a rare condition characterized by intermittent diplopia and oscillopsia.

Key features supporting this diagnosis include:
1. Intermittent diplopia occurring multiple times daily
2. Symptoms provoked by looking to the right
3. Large angle exotropia present when returning to primary gaze from sustained right gaze
4. Limitation of adduction of the right eye on attempted left gaze
5. Resolution of exotropia after 10-15 seconds

Superior oblique myokymia is thought to be caused by ephaptic transmission or hyperexcitability of the trochlear nerve. Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant medication, is the first-line treatment for this condition. It works by stabilizing the neuronal membrane and reducing abnormal nerve firing.

The other options are less appropriate:
A. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies are used to diagnose myasthenia gravis, which typically presents with fluctuating ptosis and generalized weakness, not seen in this case.
B. MRI has already been performed as part of her pituitary adenoma treatment, and her symptoms are not suggestive of a structural lesion.
C. Surgical intervention (bilateral lateral rectus recessions) would be premature without first attempting medical management, especially given the intermittent nature of her symptoms.

Therefore, initiating a trial of carbamazepine is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

These tonic muscle contractions classically affect the lower face and ipsilateral arm, but involvement of the leg, alternating episodes, or bilateral episodes may occur.1 They are typically brief (<3 seconds) and can occur up to hundreds of times a day.2 These movements are nearly pathognomonic for anti–LGI-1 autoimmunity and can be seen in about half of patients with this trait.3 Although EEG is frequently obscured by muscle artifact, preceding rhythmic δ activity and EEG attenuation after FBDS may be seen.4 Associated ictal features may occur with FBDS, including fear, oral automatism, and/or loss of awareness.4The LGI-1 protein is secreted by neurons in the central nervous system and forms a transsynaptic complex involved in synaptic transmission of neuronal excitability.5 The association between LGI-1 protein dysfunction and altered neuronal excitability is seen in autosomal-dominant lateral temporal–lobe epilepsy, also known as autosomal-dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features, in which an LGI-1 gene mutation is identified in one-third to half of affected individuals.6 This disorder is usually characterized by a family history of focal seizures, often involving auditory auras (humming, buzzing, ringing, or [less frequently] complex sounds or distortions) or ictal aphasia in the absence of structural abnormalities or other substantial neurological deficits.6Anti–LGI-1 IgG4 antibodies are thought to be causative of LGI-1 encephalitis, which is the second most common cause of autoimmune encephalitis after anti–N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis and has an incidence of about 1 case per million population.5 Anti–LGI-1 autoimmunity often begins with subtle focal seizures or FBDS, which precede the onset of cognitive decline, personality changes, psychiatric symptoms, and tonic-clonic seizures typical of autoimmune limbic encephalitis.3 Other clinical manifestations include sleep disturbances, paroxysmal dizzy spells, parkinsonism, and myoclonus.7 Hyponatremia may be found in up to half of affected patients and can be a clue to the diagnosis. A malignant condition is identified in about 10% of patients and may occur in the thymus, lung, breasts, prostate, ovaries, kidneys, or alimentary tract.5 On magnetic resonance imaging, T2 hyperintensity of the medial temporal lobes is commonly found in patients with anti–LGI-1 limbic encephalitis, and T1 hyperintensity of the basal ganglia may be seen in patients with FBDS.7Recognition of FBDS is crucial to arrange for appropriate testing of anti–LGI-1 antibodies. Serum should be tested, because it may have a higher sensitivity than cerebrospinal fluid.3,7 Expedited immunotherapy in patients with FBDS is more effective than antiseizure medications to control the movements and is associated with reduced long-term disability.8 Early treatment may also prevent the evolution from FBDS to limbic encephalitis in patients with preserved cognition, further emphasizing the need to accurately diagnose these movements promptly.1 Even with immunotherapy, however, relapses can occur in one-third of patients,3 and close clinical monitoring is required so that treatment can be intensified if necessary.The patient was treated with 1-g doses of intravenous methylprednisolone for 5 days, with an oral prednisone taper that consisted of 50 mg daily for a month, followed by further decreases of 10 mg monthly. After 1 day of treatment, he had full resolution of FBDS and no further spells of any kind.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and the description of the events, the most likely diagnosis is Paroxysmal dyskinesia (Option B).

The key features supporting this diagnosis are:

1. Sudden onset of involuntary movements: The patient experiences ""involuntary nonsuppressible jerks of the right arm"" and ""involuntary, synchronous contractions of the right face, arm, and leg.""

2. Brief duration: The episodes are described as ""sustained for a few seconds before muscle relaxation occurred.""

3. Absence of EEG correlates: The case states, ""There was no epileptic abnormality that correlated with the movements on EEG,"" which rules out epileptic seizures.

4. Normal brain imaging: The MRI was reported as unremarkable, excluding structural lesions.

5. Frequency and pattern: The episodes occur multiple times a day (up to 5 times) and have been ongoing for 8 months, which is consistent with paroxysmal dyskinesia.

6. Associated symptoms: The patient experiences expressive speech difficulties and dizziness, which can be part of the paroxysmal dyskinesia spectrum.

Paroxysmal dyskinesias are a group of movement disorders characterized by sudden, brief episodes of involuntary movements. They are not associated with epileptiform activity on EEG and typically have normal brain imaging.

This diagnosis fits better than the other options:
- Tic disorder (A) typically involves more repetitive, stereotyped movements.
- Faciobrachial dystonic seizures (C) would likely show EEG changes and are often associated with autoimmune encephalitis.
- Myoclonus (D) usually involves briefer, shock-like jerks rather than sustained contractions.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and investigation results, paroxysmal dyskinesia is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

This patient initially presented elsewhere with eye redness and decreased vision in the right eye, but by the time she presented to our institution, there was greater evidence of inadequate venous outflow (ie, unilateral proptosis, corkscrew vessels extending to the limbus, blood in Schlemm canal, IRHs, and CME). These findings can classically result from venous congestion (eg, thyroid eye disease, retrobulbar mass), arteriovenous fistulization (eg, carotid cavernous sinus fistula [CCF], Sturge-Weber syndrome), or an idiopathic disease (eg, Radius-Maumenee syndrome).1 The patient’s neuroimaging was unrevealing, but given the strong clinical suspicion for CCF, a cerebral angiogram was obtained, which revealed an indirect CCF supplied by dural branches of the right cavernous internal carotid artery. Cerebral angiography is considered to be the diagnostic standard and can detect a CCF missed by less-invasive neuroimaging methods (eg, magnetic resonance angiography). In this case, use of an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent would be inappropriate because doing so would delay the diagnosis and timely treatment of the underlying CCF. Systemic therapy with corticosteroids and a laboratory workup for uveitis are also unwarranted because there was no evidence of concurrent intraocular or orbital inflammation.A CCF is an abnormal vascular communication between the internal and/or external carotid artery and cavernous sinus and may present with any combination of unilateral proptosis, engorged episcleral vessels, chemosis, diplopia, decreased vision, and even stroke.2 It may present with a bruit or pulsatile proptosis, neither of which was present in the patient described herein. The Barrow classification system categorizes CCFs as direct (type A) and indirect (types B-D).3 Direct CCFs are high-flow fistulas that typically occur following head trauma, progress rapidly, and require urgent treatment. Indirect CCFs, however, are low-flow fistulas classically seen in elderly women that tend to present more insidiously, with conjunctival injection and chemosis being the most common presenting signs.4Carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas can also present with decreased vision owing to CME and IRHs. Venous stasis retinopathy is more frequently associated with indirect CCFs and may not manifest until the venous system posterior to the cavernous sinus becomes obstructed and arterial blood flow is redirected anteriorly to the orbit, resulting in chemosis, proptosis, IRHs, CME, retinal ischemia, optic neuropathy, and/or secondary glaucoma from elevated episcleral venous pressure.5,6 When IRHs are observed, fluorescein angiography may help to determine the state of retinal perfusion and, thus, visual prognosis.Whereas direct CCFs should be treated urgently, indirect CCFs may spontaneously close and can be observed.2-4 However, indirect CCFs that fail to self-thrombose or are vision threatening (eg, severe exposure keratopathy, venous stasis retinopathy, optic neuropathy, secondary glaucoma) should be promptly treated. Endovascular embolization is considered to be the treatment of choice, with good long-term outcomes and low complication rates.7 Return of baseline visual acuity after successful CCF closure has been previously reported.8,9The patient’s CCF was embolized by neurosurgery. One week later, her vision returned to baseline, with marked improvement of her CME (Figure 2).Optical coherence tomography of the right eye showing marked improvement in cystoid macular edema within 1 week of endovascular embolization.",Ophthalmology,2019-03-01,2019,3,"A woman in her early 70s with a history of hypertension, Cushing disease status post–pituitary radiotherapy (1973), left sphenoid wing meningioma involving the left optic nerve and cavernous sinus status postsurgical debulking (2009), radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide followed by intravenous bevacizumab, and a single prior episode of deep venous thrombosis presented with 2 months of eye redness and decreased vision in her right eye.

[Explanation]
The most appropriate next step in this case is to perform an intravitreal injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agent. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1. Ocular findings: The patient presents with eye redness, decreased vision, conjunctival injection, intraretinal hemorrhages (IRHs), and cystoid macular edema (CME) in the right eye. These findings are consistent with retinal vein occlusion (RVO), which can be effectively treated with anti-VEGF agents.

2. Medical history: The patient has a history of bevacizumab treatment, which is an anti-VEGF agent. This suggests that she has previously responded to this type of therapy.

3. Risk factors: The patient has a history of hypertension and deep venous thrombosis, which are risk factors for RVO.

4. Exclusion of other causes: MRI and MRA showed no new abnormalities, and the meningioma was stable. This rules out other potential causes of her symptoms.

5. Failed previous treatment: Topical prednisolone acetate did not improve her condition, suggesting that a more targeted approach is needed.

Anti-VEGF therapy is the gold standard for treating macular edema secondary to RVO. It helps reduce vascular permeability, resolve macular edema, and improve visual acuity. Intravitreal injections allow for direct delivery of the medication to the affected area with minimal systemic side effects.

The other options are less appropriate:
B. Systemic corticosteroids are not first-line treatment for RVO and carry more systemic risks.
C. A uveitis workup is unnecessary as the clinical picture is more consistent with RVO than uveitis.
D. Cerebral angiography is not indicated as the MRI and MRA were normal, and the symptoms are localized to the eye.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Over the previous 5 months, the patient had experienced gradual onset of binocular, horizontal diplopia and ptosis of the left upper eyelid. There were no neurological deficits and no pain. Her symptoms were constant, without fluctuation during the day. There was no history of trauma or prior surgery of the eye. Her medical history was notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Family history was positive for hypertension in her mother, prostate cancer in her father, and ductal carcinoma in situ in her daughter. She was a current daily smoker at presentation. An ophthalmologic examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Pupillary, intraocular pressure, and dilated fundus examinations were unremarkable. Abduction was severely restricted in the left eye, but it did not elicit pain, and extraocular muscle movements were otherwise full. There was substantial resistance to retropulsion of the left eye. Bilateral blepharoptosis, with more severity on the left side, was noted. The margin-to-reflex distance 1 was 2 mm on the right and 0 mm on the left.

Myasthenia gravis testing (choice B) would not be preferred because the patient lacks the characteristic fluctuating symptoms. Thyroid function testing (choice D) would not be preferred because thyroid dysfunction would be expected to have presented earlier in life. Strabismus surgery (choice C) would not address the underlying cause of strabismus. Furthermore, pursuing laboratory testing or strabismus surgery may delay the diagnosis of a malignant and potentially fatal condition.Orbital computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging with contrast (choice A) were performed and demonstrated a diffuse infiltrative lesion within the left orbit, including the extraocular muscles (Figure). The patient underwent a left orbitotomy with exploration and biopsy of the mass, which produced pathological findings consistent with infiltrating lobular breast carcinoma. Although a breast examination revealed fullness of the left breast near the areola, a diagnostic mammogram, breast ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the breast were unremarkable. Despite negative imaging, she underwent a core-needle biopsy of the left breast in the area of fullness, which confirmed the diagnosis of an infiltrating, well-differentiated breast carcinoma with lobular features.Fat-suppressed, T1-weighted, post-contrast magnetic resonance image of the orbits demonstrating a diffuse infiltration of the left intraconal and extraconal orbital contents, not easily distinguished from and isointense to the extraocular muscles (arrowheads). There is gross enophthalmos of the left globe compared with the right.Breast carcinoma is the most common primary tumor to metastasize to the orbits.1 Orbital breast carcinoma metastases characteristically involve infiltration of the extraocular muscles and orbital fat. While this tumor classically involves cicatrization that results in enophthalmos, as in this case, some patients may present with exophthalmos.2 Typically, orbital metastasis will occur late in the course of breast cancer, with a mean latency between the diagnosis of primary and metastatic orbital disease of 5 years,3 with a maximum latency of as many as 25 years.4 Therefore, it is quite rare for an orbital metastasis to be the presenting finding. In such cases, breast examination or imaging will typically be revealing of the primary tumor.4-6 The presented case was unique in the absence of radiographic evidence of a primary malignant condition.In most cases of orbital breast carcinoma metastasis, personal medical history will be revealing of the primary tumor, and biopsy of the orbital lesion may be deferred.7 However, absence of established diagnosis of a primary malignant condition does not rule out the possibility of metastasis, and imaging is essential in such cases. Imaging may provide diagnostic clues,8 and a biopsy will provide definitive diagnosis and guide further testing or treatment.Treatment of orbital breast carcinoma typically involves systemic chemotherapy. External-beam radiotherapy is a generally safe and effective adjunctive treatment option,2,9 but it must be weighed against the risks of radiation to the orbit. Surgical excision is generally contraindicated, because this would not cure the underlying disease and can cause considerable morbidity, depending on the extent of involvement. However, it may be considered in case of severe symptoms refractory to other palliative efforts.2This case demonstrates the possibility that an ophthalmologist may be the first to diagnose a metastatic malignant condition such as breast carcinoma. The ophthalmologist should be aware of this possibility, and metastasis should remain on the differential in the appropriate clinical context, even in the absence of a personal cancer history in the patient. Imaging with thin-cut orbital sections should be considered in patients with strabismus but also those with enophthalmos and resistance to retropulsion.The patient is currently undergoing chemotherapy.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbits with contrast.

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings strongly suggest an orbital process, specifically:

1. Gradual onset of binocular, horizontal diplopia
2. Left upper eyelid ptosis
3. Severely restricted abduction of the left eye
4. Resistance to retropulsion of the left eye
5. Left enophthalmos (3.5 mm)
6. Hollowing of the left superior sulcus

These signs are consistent with a space-occupying lesion in the left orbit, which could be causing mass effect and affecting the extraocular muscles and orbital structures. The enophthalmos and hollowing of the superior sulcus suggest possible orbital volume loss or tissue contraction.

A CT scan of the orbits with contrast would provide detailed imaging of the orbital structures, allowing for visualization of any masses, infiltrative processes, or structural abnormalities. This imaging modality would help identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and guide further management.

The other options are less appropriate in this case:

A. Myasthenia gravis testing is not the best next step, as the symptoms are constant without fluctuation, which is atypical for myasthenia gravis.

C. Referral for strabismus surgery is premature without identifying the underlying cause of the ocular misalignment.

D. Thyroid function testing, while potentially relevant in some cases of orbital disease, is not the most urgent next step given the clinical presentation suggestive of a space-occupying lesion.

Therefore, a CT scan of the orbits with contrast (option B) is the most appropriate next step in evaluating this patient's condition.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Please analyze the following clinical case and the related question:

<clinical_case>
A 75-year-old woman was referred to the ophthalmology clinic for evaluation of double vision and a droopy left upper eyelid. Over the previous 5 months, the patient had experienced gradual onset of binocular, horizontal diplopia and ptosis of the left upper eyelid. There were no neurological deficits and no pain. Her symptoms were constant, without fluctuation during the day. There was no history of trauma or prior surgery of the eye. Her medical history was notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Family history was positive for hypertension in her mother, prostate cancer in her father, and ductal carcinoma in situ in her daughter. She was a current daily smoker at presentation. An ophthalmologic examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Pupillary, intraocular pressure, and dilated fundus examinations were unremarkable. Abduction was severely restricted in the left eye, but it did not elicit pain, and extraocular muscle movements were otherwise full. There was substantial resistance to retropulsion of the left eye. Bilateral blepharoptosis, with more severity on the left side, was noted. The margin-to-reflex distance 1 was 2 mm on the right and 0 mm on the left. A 3.5-mm left enophthalmos was noted compared with the right side, and there was hollowing of the left superior sulcus.

He had not received medical care in 20 years and had no known medical diagnoses, but his social history was notable for consumption of approximately 12 alcoholic beverages per day. His ocular history was notable for left-eye enucleation from recent trauma. He initially presented to his local ophthalmologist with right eye redness, pain, and photophobia for 1 week. He was diagnosed with a corneal ulcer. Bacterial (aerobic and anaerobic) and fungal cultures were obtained, and the patient started receiving topical moxifloxacin.

The differential diagnosis for a nonhealing corneal ulcer may include inadequate antibiotic coverage, a nonbacterial infectious source, systemic autoimmune conditions, and epithelial wound-healing deficits.The patient’s history and presentation is consistent with vitamin A deficiency–associated keratomalacia. Patients with alcoholism may have protein and vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin A,1 because of both low dietary intake and decreased absorption. Nyctalopia is often the initial finding in vitamin A deficiency,2 although it was not present in this case. Vitamin A deficiency may also lead to ocular surface disease, such as conjunctival and corneal xerosis, and diffuse or focal keratin accumulation with a foamy appearance (Bitôt spots). There is a lack of mucin because goblet cells in the mucosal surface are greatly reduced.3 In advanced stages, keratomalacia may develop, with severe corneal ulceration and thinning, and this may ultimately result in diffuse corneal necrosis.Confocal microscopy to evaluate for cysts (choice A) to diagnose Acanthamoeba keratitis would not be the preferred answer. An infectious causative mechanism that is inadequately treated by a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone, such as Acanthamoeba keratitis, typically presents as a nonhealing corneal ulcer in a patient who wears contact lenses, often associated with radial keratoneuritis and/or a ring ulcer.Similarly, a herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection test (choice B) would not be the preferred choice. While herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis may be considered in cases of nonhealing corneal ulcers, it is primarily a clinical diagnosis, and this patient lacked the dendritic ulcerations, subepithelial or deep stromal infiltrates, and corneal edema characteristic of this clinical entity. Decreased corneal sensation may suggest a neurotrophic causative mechanism, owing to diabetes, chemical burns, contact lens use, and chronic topical medications. However, this patient’s metabolic profile, including his glucose level, was unremarkable, and the history and examination did not reveal burns, contact lens use, or topical medications.Broadening antibiotic coverage (choice C) would not be the preferred answer. There is a low suspicion of infection, given the lack of injection, infiltrate, and discharge on examination. In addition, bacterial and fungal cultures were negative. While it is reasonable to repeat cultures, vancomycin and tobramycin may induce corneal epithelial toxicity, which may exacerbate the problem.The urgency of identifying vitamin A deficiency is associated with both systemic and ocular manifestations. Children with keratomalacia owing to vitamin A deficiency have a high mortality rate, with estimates up to 30% to 80%.4,5 Keratomalacia may progress to corneal perforation  in a matter of days if left untreated.6 Furthermore, stromal loss is irreversible, resulting in permanent structural damage.7This patient started receiving high-dose oral vitamin A supplementation at 200 000 IU for the first 2 consecutive days, followed by another dose 1 week later.8 He also started receiving aggressive lubricating ointment, while decreasing topical moxifloxacin use. He had marked improvement in his right eye pain, vision, and corneal thinning. His conjunctival and corneal keratinization also improved dramatically within several days.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and history provided, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain herpes simplex virus (HSV) tissue culture and antigen detection tests.

The patient presents with a nonhealing corneal ulcer that has not responded to initial antibiotic treatment. Several key features of this case suggest a possible herpetic etiology:

1. Unilateral presentation: The ulcer is present in only one eye, which is typical for HSV keratitis.

2. Diminished corneal sensation: This is a hallmark sign of herpetic keratitis, as the virus affects the corneal nerves.

3. Well-demarcated epithelial defect with stromal thinning: This description is consistent with a herpetic geographic ulcer.

4. Negative bacterial and fungal cultures: The initial cultures were negative, and the ulcer did not respond to antibiotic treatment, suggesting a non-bacterial cause.

5. Patient's history of alcohol abuse: Chronic alcoholism can suppress the immune system, making the patient more susceptible to viral infections like HSV.

Given these factors, it is crucial to rule out herpetic keratitis before considering other diagnoses or broadening antibiotic coverage. HSV testing through tissue culture and antigen detection would provide a definitive diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment, which would likely include antiviral therapy if positive.

The other options are less appropriate at this stage:
- Confocal microscopy (A) is more useful for diagnosing fungal keratitis or acanthamoeba, which are less likely given the clinical picture.
- Vitamin A deficiency (C) typically presents with bilateral symptoms and is less common in developed countries.
- Broadening antibiotic coverage (D) is not warranted without evidence of bacterial infection, especially given the negative cultures and lack of response to initial antibiotics.

Therefore, obtaining HSV tissue culture and antigen detection tests is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Her younger brother was previously diagnosed with bilateral parasellar masses that extended into the right orbital apex, causing a neurogenic ptosis of the right upper eyelid. The brother  subsequently tested positive for NF2 gene with deletion of exons 1 through 7. Genetic testing results obtained for the patient were positive for an abnormality in the NF2 gene with deletion of the NF2 exons 1 through 7. Observation (choice C) and surgical intervention (choice B) are both potential management options for patients with epiretinal membranes. However, an epiretinal membrane in a child should prompt further medical history, family medical history, and potential genetic testing (choice A) for systemic disorders. Ocriplasmin injection (choice D) would not be the correct treatment for removal of epiretinal membranes.An autosomal dominant inherited disorder, neurofibromatosis type 2, is caused by mutations in the NF2 gene located on chromosome 22.1 Abnormalities in the NF2 gene, which produces the tumor suppressor merlin protein, lead to the disease. Individuals with the disease are predisposed to tumors of the nervous system, including bilateral vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and spinal tumors. Although thought to be rare, the incidence of NF2 may be as high as 1 in 25 000 persons.2 Skin lesions are an important diagnostic criterion for neurofibromatosis type 1; however, skin lesions can also be found in patients with NF2.3 Ophthalmic manifestations can be seen including cataracts, epiretinal membranes, retinal hamartomas, and optic nerve meningiomas.Epiretinal membranes are a common finding in NF2 and are usually solitary within each eye and located in the macula. They have been described in children as young as 4 years and are likely to be congenital.4 Many epiretinal membranes in NF2 have a spiculated appearance with curled edges, projecting anteriorly into the vitreous and best visualized using optical coherence tomography.5There has been controversy about whether these epiretinal membranes could represent a mild form of combined hamartomas of the retinal and retina pigment epithelium. Although both are similar congenital macular lesions, there are certain optical coherence tomographic characteristics that can differentiate them. Combined hamartomas of the retinal and retina pigment epithelium lesions show greater retinal disorganization, photoreceptor attenuation, and loss of the foveal depression compared with NF2 epiretinal membranes.5Although observation of NF2-related epiretinal membranes is an option if the vision loss is mild, recent studies have shown gains in vision with early pars plana vitrectomy and epiretinal membrane peel.6,7 Bonnin et al7 reported operating on 13 patients with epiretinal membranes who were 12 years or younger. Of the 13 patients, 12 had improvement in visual acuity and the corrected visual acuity improved from an average of 20/160 to 20/40.The patient has continued to follow up with a pediatric neurologist, who has recommended magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to rule out central nervous system lesions.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation of this 8-year-old girl with bilateral macular lesions, obtaining a family medical history and genetic testing is the most appropriate next step.

The patient presents with several key findings that suggest a possible genetic or hereditary condition:

1. Bilateral macular lesions: The presence of symmetrical, eccentric, yellow-clear preretinal lesions in both maculas is unusual in a young child and suggests a possible genetic etiology.

2. Skin finding: The single, lightly pigmented macule on her right upper arm could be associated with a neurocutaneous syndrome.

3. Early onset: The lesions were noted by a pediatric ophthalmologist, indicating they developed at a young age.

4. Stable visual acuity: Despite the macular lesions, her vision has remained stable at 20/40 in both eyes, which is atypical for acquired epiretinal membranes.

5. OCT findings: The hyperreflective areas on the surface of the macula with a spiculated appearance and anterior projection into the vitreous are not typical of standard epiretinal membranes.

Given these findings, it's crucial to investigate potential genetic conditions that could explain this clinical picture. Some possibilities include:

- Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR)
- X-linked retinoschisis
- Neurofibromatosis type 2 (considering the skin finding)
- Other rare hereditary vitreoretinopathies

Obtaining a detailed family medical history could reveal similar ocular conditions in relatives, supporting a genetic etiology. Genetic testing can help identify specific mutations associated with these conditions, providing a definitive diagnosis and guiding future management and genetic counseling.

Surgical intervention (option C) or intravitreal injection (option B) would be premature without a clear diagnosis, especially given the stable vision. Observation alone (option D) is insufficient, as identifying an underlying genetic condition could have important implications for the patient's long-term care and family planning.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Stable visual acuity: Despite the macular lesions, her vision has remained stable at 20/40 in both eyes, which is atypical for acquired epiretinal membranes.\n\n5. OCT findings: The hyperreflective areas on the surface of the macula with a spiculated appearance and anterior projection into the vitreous are not typical of standard epiretinal membranes.\n\nGiven these findings, it's crucial to investigate potential genetic conditions that could explain this clinical picture.

Acquired epithelial lesions include squamous cell carcinoma and papilloma. Subepithelial lesions range from benign causes, such as lacrimal gland duct cysts and myxomas, to infiltrative conditions, such as metastatic carcinoma. Pigmented lesions typically consist of nevi or malignant melanoma, and inflammatory lesions can stem from conditions such as sarcoidosis.2When a patient presents with a conjunctival lesion, diagnostic imaging is important. Given the concern for an orbital mass in this case, orbital imaging was the initial step of evaluation. Findings of the computed tomographic scan that was performed were nonspecific, as was B-scan ultrasonography. Given the lack of diagnostic information from imaging, a conjunctival biopsy was performed to evaluate the lesion, which is important given the patient’s history of both thyroid and breast cancer.3 Although a systemic workup, including complete blood cell count and basic metabolic panel as well as serum and urine electrophoresis, are important in the evaluation for lymphoma or amyloidosis, the conjunctival biopsy was the next step given its ability to provide a more specific diagnosis.4,5 Histopathologic testing results revealed tumor cells with estrogen-receptor positive, progesterone-receptor positive, and ERBB2-negative, confirming the diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma (Figure 2). Topical corticosteroids are useful in inflammatory conditions, but would not be indicated in this patient.Histopathologic examination of a conjunctival lesion revealing tumor cells (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×400).The most common primary tumor to give rise to ocular metastasis in the female population is breast carcinoma.6 The incidence of ocular metastasis among patients with breast cancer is approximately 8% to 10%, typically occurring 2 to 5 years after initial diagnosis of the primary tumor.7 Metastatic lesions to the conjunctiva are uncommon and indicate poor prognosis.3 Symptoms include pain, chemosis, and foreign body sensation.3,6-9 In this case, the patient noticed ptosis, but was not aware of the conjunctival lesion as the lesion was not visible until the upper eyelid was everted.Most metastatic conjunctival lesions regress with external-beam radiotherapy, excisional biopsy, and/or chemotherapy.3,7 Because ocular disease presents when the systemic malignant lesion is advanced, the prognosis tends to be poor.2 The mean reported survival time after diagnosis of a conjunctival mass varies, ranging from 3 weeks to 26 months.3,6 Therefore, it is important to recognize conjunctival metastasis upon examination to provide timely and adequate therapeutic intervention.6,8 In addition, our case highlights the importance of obtaining a thorough history, because distant metastases can present many years after the initial diagnosis of nonocular malignant diseases.The patient underwent an excisional conjunctival biopsy on the same day as presentation, confirming the diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma. Further systemic evaluation revealed additional metastases to the cervical, lumbar, and thoracic spine; sacrum and bilateral iliac bones; adrenal glands; and lymph nodes.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and the patient's medical history, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a conjunctival biopsy (Option A).

The patient presents with a gradually worsening ptosis and a visible conjunctival mass in the right eye. Considering her history of thyroid cancer and breast cancer, there is a high suspicion for a metastatic lesion or a new primary malignancy.

The presence of a solid, superior bulbar conjunctival mass measuring 10 mm in diameter, as revealed by eversion of the right upper eyelid, strongly suggests the need for tissue diagnosis. The B-scan ultrasonography showing an extraconal, noncompressible lesion of orbital tissue further supports this decision.

A conjunctival biopsy would provide definitive histopathological diagnosis, which is crucial for determining the nature of the lesion (benign vs. malignant) and guiding further management. This is particularly important given the patient's history of malignancies, as it could represent a metastatic lesion or a new primary tumor.

Options B and C (blood tests and electrophoresis) would not provide specific information about the conjunctival mass and are less likely to lead to a definitive diagnosis in this case. Option D (topical corticosteroids) would be inappropriate without a clear diagnosis and could potentially delay proper treatment if the mass is indeed malignant.

Therefore, a conjunctival biopsy is the most appropriate next step to guide further management and treatment for this patient.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Therefore, it is not proper to use immunosuppressants and corticosteroids (choices A and B) before a definite diagnosis. Although the patient lacked neurological symptoms other than visual loss, the bilateral papilledema and partially empty sella indicated intracranial hypertension, the possible causes of which include arteriovenous malformations, intracranial mass lesions, obstruction to venous drainage, decreased flow through arachnoid granulations, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.2 Moreover, a negative magnetic resonance imaging result cannot fully rule out cerebral vascular abnormalities, among which cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) accounts for 9.4% of the presumed idiopathic intracranial hypertension.3 In suspected CVT, magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography (choice C) is recommended when the magnetic resonance imaging result is negative.4 Therefore, a cerebral magnetic resonance venography of the patient was performed, showing thromboses of the superior sagittal sinus and the right transverse and sigmoid sinus (Figure 2). Draining cerebrospinal fluid is suggested when intracranial hypertension results in vision-threatening papilledema.5 Therefore, a lumber puncture was performed to confirm intracranial hypertension (showing opening pressure of 30.5 cm H2O) and to remove cerebrospinal fluid. Acetazolamide was also initiated to lower the intracranial pressure. Anticoagulation therapy of heparin was started to facilitate recanalization and to prevent recurrent CVT and other venous thrombosis. Endovascular thrombolysis was performed to prevent visual loss of the left eye. The catheter cerebral angiography (choice D), which is invasive, is only considered when magnetic resonance venography or computed tomography venography results are inconclusive or an endovascular procedure is performed.4 Therefore, it was performed along with endovascular thrombolysis to visualize thrombosed veins.Cerebral magnetic resonance venography showed thromboses of the superior sagittal sinus, the right transverse sinus and the right sigmoid sinus (white arrowheads), and stenosis of the left sigmoid sinus (yellow arrowhead).Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare cerebrovascular disease, with an annual incidence of 3 to 4 cases per million.6 Headache is the most common symptom, presenting in 90% of patients, while focal seizures, paresis, impaired consciousness, and visual disturbance are less common.6 Cerebral venous thrombosis only presenting visual loss is extremely rare.7 The lack of headaches and other neurological symptoms in this case might be caused by the gradually raised intracranial pressure and compensatory anatomical adjustments. Empty sella might be caused by the persistent intracranial hypertension, which pressed the subarachnoid space through the incomplete sellar diaphragm. The normal D-dimer level might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptoms (more than 1 week).8 Risk factors of CVT were miscellaneous, including prothrombotic conditions, infections, trauma, cancer, and systemic diseases such as BD.6 This patient had BD and had taken thalidomide, both of which are predisposing factors of CVT.6,9One month following thrombolysis, the patient’s bilateral papilledema resolved. Three months later, the visual field of her left eye became normal, while the blindness of her right eye was irreversible. This case reminded us that when empty sella meets bilateral papilledema, intracranial hypertension should be considered even in the absence of neurologic symptoms, and CVT can be one of the possible diagnoses.",Ophthalmology,2019-02-01,2019,2,"A woman in her 30s was referred for evaluation of bilateral papilledema and progressive visual loss in the right eye, which deteriorated to blindness in 3 months.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain cerebral magnetic resonance venography (MRV) or computed tomographic venography (CTV).

The patient presents with bilateral papilledema, progressive visual loss leading to blindness in one eye, and peripheral visual field defects in the other eye. These symptoms, combined with the fundus examination showing papilledema and the MRI finding of partially empty sella, strongly suggest increased intracranial pressure (ICP).

While the patient has a history of Behçet's disease, the lack of response to high-dose corticosteroids and the absence of active uveitis on fluorescein angiography make it less likely that the current symptoms are directly related to a flare of Behçet's disease.

The combination of increased ICP, papilledema, and visual symptoms without other neurological signs or space-occupying lesions on MRI raises the suspicion of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). CVST is a known complication of Behçet's disease and can occur even when the disease is otherwise stable.

MRV or CTV are the preferred non-invasive imaging modalities for diagnosing CVST. These tests can visualize the cerebral venous system and identify any thrombosis or stenosis that may be causing the increased ICP and subsequent papilledema.

Obtaining these imaging studies is crucial before considering more aggressive treatments or invasive procedures. If CVST is confirmed, appropriate anticoagulation therapy can be initiated, which could potentially reverse the patient's symptoms and prevent further visual loss.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Types of acquired ptosis include aponeurotic ptosis involving slippage of the aponeurosis seen in elderly patients or after trauma, neurogenic ptosis from damage to the oculomotor or sympathetic nerves in the eyelid, myogenic ptosis from dysfunction of the levator muscle due to diseases such as myasthenia gravis, and mechanical ptosis from eyelid tumors or orbital fat prolapse.Unexplained ptosis in a young patient should alert the ophthalmologist because the cause of acquired ptosis will guide management. Aponeurotic ptosis with normal levator function is often corrected by conjunctival resection of the Müller muscle (choice C) provided there is adequate response of the eyelid to the phenylephrine test.1 Other options include the external levator advancement (choice D) or, in the case of poor levator function, the frontalis suspension. However, these choices are not preferred because this patient was young, and the cause was not confirmed to be aponeurotic ptosis. Other causes, such as myasthenia gravis, should be considered. Levator fatigability can be checked by prolonged upgaze for 1 to 2 minutes, followed by an ice pack test for ptosis correction with muscle cooling.2 Acetylcholine receptor antibody is specific, but caution should be exercised before commencing pyridostigmine bromide treatment (choice A), because this patient did not have systemic symptoms, extraocular muscle restriction, or fatigability. Horner syndrome should be excluded by confirming that no anisocoria is present that responds to apraclonidine or cocaine testing. Third nerve palsy should be excluded by confirming normal extraocular motility and pupils.This patient’s atypical presentation of ptosis warranted imaging. With computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (choice B), her ptosis was determined to be mechanical and secondary to compression of the superior rectus–levator muscle complex by a superior orbital rim tumor, likely an intraosseous hemangioma. These rare proliferations consist of endothelial-lined vascular channels.3-6 Intraosseous hemangiomas most often occur in the vertebral column, but case reports have reported occurrence in orbital bones.4,6,7 Intraosseous hemangiomas can cause mechanical ptosis, proptosis, diplopia, and vision loss.3,6,8 Radiographically, an appearance of an osteolytic sunburst pattern with superior resolution on MRI shows intralesional vascularity.3,7 The differential diagnosis can include fibrous dysplasia, chondroma, meningioma, osteoma, eosinophilic granuloma, and metastatic disease.3,4 Surgical resection is the definitive treatment for lesions causing secondary complications, although for smaller lesions, resection may not be needed.6Computed tomographic imaging and MRI of the orbit showed an enhancing osseous lesion at the superior orbital rim with extension into the superior orbit and mass effect on the superior rectus–levator muscle complex (Figure 2). A combined neurosurgery and oculoplastic procedure was performed, where the tumor was removed via a left-sided craniotomy and the defect was reconstructed with an orbital rim implant.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to check myasthenia laboratory findings and commence a pyridostigmine trial (Option B).

The patient presents with several key symptoms that suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis:

1. Painless ptosis: This is a classic symptom of myasthenia gravis, especially when it's unilateral and of recent onset (10 months in this case).

2. Intermittent diplopia: Double vision that occurs in all gazes is another common symptom of myasthenia gravis.

3. Fatigability: Although not explicitly stated, the intermittent nature of the diplopia suggests fatigability, which is characteristic of myasthenia gravis.

4. Improvement with phenylephrine: The fact that the patient's margin-to-reflex distance became equal after phenylephrine application suggests that the ptosis is not due to a mechanical problem with the eyelid, but rather a neuromuscular issue.

5. Normal ductions and versions: This indicates that the problem is not likely due to a cranial nerve palsy or mechanical restriction.

Given these findings, it's crucial to rule out myasthenia gravis before considering other diagnoses or treatments. Checking myasthenia laboratory findings (such as acetylcholine receptor antibodies) and starting a pyridostigmine trial would be the most appropriate next step. Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that can improve symptoms in myasthenia gravis and can serve as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool.

The other options are less appropriate at this stage:

A. Imaging studies might be considered later if myasthenia gravis is ruled out, but it's not the first-line approach given the clinical presentation.

C and D. Surgical interventions (Müller muscle conjunctival resection or external levator advancement) would be premature without first ruling out a systemic cause like myasthenia gravis.

Therefore, option B is the most appropriate next step in this clinical scenario.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases. You will be presented with a clinical case and a set of options. Your role is to:

A longer trial of topical steroid with topical antihistamine (choice B) would be less favorable because symptoms and follicle appearance were not consistent with allergic conjunctivitis. Chest radiography and angiotensin-converting enzyme level test (choice D) would not be recommended as the patient’s more translucent follicles did not have the typical appearance of the yellow or tan conjunctival nodules found in ocular sarcoidosis. Because of the chronic nature and abnormal, large nodular appearance of the follicles, conjunctival biopsy was pursued for definitive diagnosis after a negative infectious serologic testing result. This biopsy showed centrocytes consistent with follicular lymphoma (Figure 2). Flow cytometry demonstrated a CD 10–positive monotypic B cell population. Fluorescence in situ hybridization testing detected a t(14;18) translocation. He was subsequently referred to the hematology-oncology service for systemic workup, including hepatitis B and C serologic tests, antinuclear antibody panel test, serum protein electrophoresis, Chlamydophila psittaci serologic test, serum κ or λ light chains, whole-body positron emission tomography–computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

Most of these lesions are found unilaterally in the orbit, and most neoplastic lesions are of monoclonal B cell origin.2 Conjunctival lymphoid lesions are described as mobile salmon-pink or flesh-colored patches in the fornix or bulbar conjunctiva.2-5 Symptoms include irritation, blurred vision, and epiphora and can present as a mass, ptosis, or diplopia.3A greater concern is systemic involvement, with bilateral presentation of ocular adnexal lymphomas. In large institutional case reviews, the incidence of systemic lymphoma findings at the time of local ocular diagnosis or up to 5 years afterward was between 20% to 30%.3,6 Extraocular sites included lymph nodes, bone marrow, abdomen, brain, and lungs. A predictive factor in systemic involvement was the location in the conjunctival fornix or midbulbar conjunctiva.3 With or without treatment, the mortality rate from systemic lymphoma in the long term was less than 5%. With radiation treatment, recurrence of disease was low (0%-20%) in the first 1 to 5 years after the biopsy.6-8The differential diagnosis for chronic conjunctivitis is extensive, including allergic reaction, adverse effect from ophthalmic medications or contact lenses and their cleaning solutions, viral and bacterial etiologies, and blepharoconjunctivitis.9,10 Infectious etiologies include herpesviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, coxsackieviruses, Chlamydia trachomatis, Moraxella species, and Bartonella henselae.

[Explanation]
Given the persistent nature of the patient's condition and the negative results for common infectious causes, the next appropriate step would be to order chest radiography and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) serum level test. This approach is warranted for the following reasons:

1. Persistent symptoms: The patient's right eye symptoms have persisted for over a year despite initial treatment and negative tests for common causes like chlamydia, gonorrhea, Lyme disease, and active Epstein-Barr virus infection.

2. Ruling out sarcoidosis: The combination of chest radiography and ACE level testing is primarily aimed at screening for sarcoidosis, a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can affect the eyes. Sarcoidosis can present with conjunctival follicles and is an important differential diagnosis in this case.

3. Non-invasive approach: This option provides valuable diagnostic information without resorting to more invasive procedures like a conjunctival biopsy.

4. Guiding further management: The results of these tests will help determine the next steps in management, whether it's confirming a diagnosis of sarcoidosis or prompting further investigation into other systemic causes of chronic follicular conjunctivitis.

5. Avoiding unnecessary treatments: Starting empirical antibiotic treatment (like azithromycin) or prolonged steroid use without a clear diagnosis could potentially mask underlying conditions or lead to unnecessary side effects.

By choosing this diagnostic approach, we can gather more information about potential systemic causes of the patient's persistent conjunctival follicles, which will guide further management and treatment decisions.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Most cases are caused by 1 of 3 variants: m.3460G>A, m.11778G>A, and m.14484T>C.1 Leber hereditary optic neuropathy mostly affects men from age 15 to 35 years.1 The vision loss is secondary to the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), particularly of smaller axons in the papillomacular bundle.2 In asymptomatic carriers, peripapillary microangiopathy and the swelling of the retinal nerve fiber layer herald progression to the symptomatic stage, when vision loss occurs.3 The optic disc develops variable degrees of pallor. The segmentation of retinal layers on SD-OCT is helpful in pointing toward a diagnosis of LHON if thinning of the RGC is demonstrated (Figure 2); however, it does not establish the diagnosis.3,4 The thickening of the outer retina has also been described,4 although studies have not demonstrated damage to photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium.5 To our knowledge, it is unknown whether the outer retinal thickening results from the abnormal mitochondrial metabolism in photoreceptors or as an anatomical response to RGC thinning.4Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography segmentation of the left eye demonstrates a thinning of the ganglion cell layer.Although the full-field electroretinography results were normal, the mfERG results may be abnormal. Reduced amplitudes in mfERG responses in first- and second-order kernels have been described, and it is unclear whether these changes reflect cone dysfunction or contributions from the inner retina.6 For patients like this one whose mfERG amplitudes are reduced, the differentiation of LHON from maculopathy is challenging and genetic testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The presence of a variant in the mitochondrial DNA does not always lead to vision loss. The heteroplasmy levels influence the susceptibility to vision loss.1 In this case, mitochondrial gene testing results revealed homoplasmy and confirmed LHON as the cause of the vision loss.Because toxic and nutritional optic neuropathies may have similar presentations, patients should be asked about the use of methanol, ethambutol, linezolid, amiodarone, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and alcohol and tobacco and should be tested for deficiencies of vitamin B12, B1, folate, and copper. This patient denied use of these substances and nutritional deficiencies. Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy should also be considered in patients older than 50 years.7 It is painless, may sequentially affect both eyes, and does not cause an afferent pupillary defect when both eyes are affected. Patients should be asked about cardiovascular disease and sleep apnea, risk factors that are associated with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.7 This patient did not have these risk factors.The key clinical feature in this case is the abnormal mfERG in a neuropathy that is known to affect the RGC. Optic neuropathies and maculopathies may have overlapping presentations, but abnormal mfERG generally excludes optic neuropathies. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy can cause reduced mfERG amplitudes, and mitochondrial genetic testing is necessary to distinguish it from maculopathies. There is spontaneous visual improvement in some patients and gene therapy and drugs, such as idebenone, are being tested as a prevention against progressive visual loss.8 Clinical misdiagnosis of this constellation of signs and symptoms can lead to unwarranted treatments and patient harm.The patient’s visual acuity and other functional and structural test results have remained stable, and he has been periodically followed up.",Ophthalmology,2019-01-01,2019,1,"A 60-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of progressive painless visual loss, photophobia, and color vision impairment in both eyes.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to order mitochondrial genetic testing (Option C).

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), which is a mitochondrial genetic disorder. The key features supporting this diagnosis are:

1. Progressive, painless visual loss affecting both eyes sequentially (right eye first, then left eye 4 months later).
2. Age of onset (60 years old) is within the typical range for LHON, which can occur from childhood to late adulthood.
3. Presence of central scotomas (dense bilateral cecocentral scotomata on kinetic perimetry).
4. Normal-appearing or minimally pale optic discs on fundus examination.
5. Normal full-field electroretinography with reduced amplitudes on multifocal electroretinography, particularly in the papillomacular region.
6. Normal brain and orbital MRI, ruling out compressive or inflammatory causes.
7. Negative autoimmune and infectious workup.

LHON is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, most commonly in the ND1, ND4, and ND6 genes. These mutations affect complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, leading to dysfunction in the most metabolically active cells, such as the retinal ganglion cells.

Given the strong clinical suspicion for LHON, mitochondrial genetic testing is the most appropriate next step. This will help confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific mutation, which can have implications for prognosis and potential future treatments.

The other options, while potentially useful in some cases, are less likely to provide a definitive diagnosis or guide management in this particular case:

A. SD-OCT segmentation has already been performed and showed no abnormalities.
B. Cardiovascular risk factors are less likely to be the primary cause given the progressive, bilateral nature of the vision loss.
D. While toxic agents and nutritional deficiencies can cause optic neuropathy, the clinical presentation is more typical of a genetic etiology in this case.

Therefore, mitochondrial genetic testing is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup for this patient.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

The differential diagnosis includes hereditary optic neuropathies such as Leber optic neuropathy, autosomal dominant optic atrophy, and Wolfram disease1; compressive tumors; and traumatic and toxic neuropathy. Systemic involvement including bilateral sensorineural deafness, diabetes mellitus, and diabetes insipidus led us to the diagnosis of DIDMOAD syndrome.Fundus image showing optic atrophy: pale disc with well-defined margins and normal retinal vasculature.Wolfram disease is also called DIDMOAD syndrome, an eponym for diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness. The initial manifestation is insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus around 6 years of age, followed by optic atrophy at 11 years of age.2 In the second decade, many patients develop diabetes insipidus and sensorineural deafness. Inheritance is autosomal recessive and is due to mutations in the WFS1 gene in the short arm of chromosome 4 that encodes transmembrane proteins in endoplasmic reticulum, thus resulting in a multi-organ system disorder.3Neuroimaging in the setting of primary optic atrophy is to rule out intracranial tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (choice A) was not the preferred answer because progressive neurodegeneration manifesting as optic atrophy is common in Wolfram disease. In advanced stages of Wolfram disease, neuroimaging will detect cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, absence of hypophyseal signal, and brain stem atrophy, which causes respiratory failure and early death.4,5 Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain did not reveal a space-occupying lesion or atrophic changes in this patient.Although there is no cure for Wolfram disease, a thorough endocrinology evaluation (choice B) and necessary hormone supplementation will profoundly affect these patients.6 Degeneration of the hypothalamohypophyseal axis results in varying degrees of hormonal imbalances. As polyuria and polydipsia are seen in both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus, the latter was overlooked by other physicians. The patient was much more comfortable after starting oral desmopressin acetate, 0.05 mg twice daily, to treat his diabetes insipidus.Reports suggest that megaloblastic anemia might be part of DIDMOAD syndrome owing to improper thiamine metabolism and that early treatment with thiamine supplementation might play a role in preventing the full-blown expression of the syndrome.7 However, this observation needs further research. Hence, a peripheral blood smear examination (choice C) was not the preferred answer.Although genetic analysis is confirmatory, targeted genetic testing (choice D) was not the preferred answer because DIDMOAD syndrome is a clinical diagnosis. Genetic testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal screening are possible if the disease-causing mutations are known.8This case emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary care of patients with Wolfram disease. Ophthalmologists are among the first physicians these patients seek, owing to early vision loss. A high index of suspicion will identify the underlying systemic associations.The patient started hormone replacement (oral desmopressin acetate, testosterone, and thyroxine) by the endocrinologist. Aids for low vision were prescribed, including a handheld magnifier and spectacle-mounted telescope. He was advised to return for regular eye examinations to identify any diabetic retinopathy.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to order targeted genetic testing. This decision is supported by several key factors in the case:

1. Multisystem involvement: The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems, including vision loss, hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, short stature, hypochondroplasia, alopecia, and hypotonia. This pattern strongly suggests a genetic syndrome rather than isolated conditions.

2. Early onset and progressive nature: The symptoms began in childhood (vision loss at 8 years, diabetes at 10 years) and have been progressive, which is characteristic of many genetic disorders.

3. Specific clinical features: The combination of optic atrophy, hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, and diabetes insipidus is highly suggestive of Wolfram syndrome (also known as DIDMOAD syndrome - Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy, and Deafness). This is a rare genetic disorder typically caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene.

4. Exclusion of other causes: The case provides no evidence of infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic processes that could explain the symptoms. The patient's diabetic status has been noted, but diabetic retinopathy has been ruled out as a cause of vision loss.

Targeted genetic testing would be the most efficient next step to confirm the suspected diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome or identify another related genetic disorder. This would provide a definitive diagnosis, guide further management, and inform genetic counseling for the patient and family.

While hormonal testing (Option C) might be helpful, it would not provide the definitive diagnosis that genetic testing could offer.

Risk factor modification (choice A) would not be correct because it is the next step in the management of NAION, for which hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea are commonly found modifiable vascular risk factors.1 Visual acuity can be normal in the setting of disc edema in incipient NAION; however, the duration of optic swelling would have been shorter, and NAION would not have caused gaze-evoked amaurosis.1,2 Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy most commonly causes an inferior altitudinal defect, whereas our patient had peripheral field loss in the right eye. A lumbar puncture (choice B) is not the next step, but it would be used to obtain the opening pressure to diagnose papilledema, which can also cause visually asymptomatic disc edema. However, papilledema causes transient visual obscurations and not gaze-evoked amaurosis.The prominent gaze-evoked amaurosis suggested an orbital mass as the cause of the disc edema. When the patient developed a slowly progressive optic neuropathy, the diagnosis of an orbital lesion was almost a certainty.3 In retrospect, the lesion was just barely appreciable on the MRI performed at initial presentation (Figure 1A). Optic nerve sheath meningioma (ONSM) is the most likely possible cause underlying progressively worsening vision loss and gaze-evoked amaurosis. Although the initial MRI scan did not show an obvious lesion 2 years ago, imaging often can miss ONSM, which can present subtly early in its development; repeat imaging is warranted here.Another MRI scan of the orbit (choice C) revealed thin circumferential enhancement around the right optic nerve in the optic canal and extending into the posterior right orbit and along the intracranial right optic nerve (Figure 2). Given the clinical course of slowly progressive worsening vision during a 2-year period, the circumferential enhancing lesion was determined to be an ONSM. Management is based on tumor size and the extent of vision loss. Treatment is radiotherapy to preserve vision loss and prevent progression.A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan of the orbit with contrast at presentation reveals thin circumferential enhancement of the right optic nerve sheath in the optic canal that extends into the posterior right orbit and along the intracranial right optic nerve (arrows), which is more obvious than in the scan performed 2 years prior to presentation.Corticosteroids (choice D) would not be the next step. Corticosteroids treat optic perineuritis, which may radiographically simulate ONSM, but patients present with subacute monocular visual loss and would have pain with eye movements and not gaze-evoked amaurosis.4,5 This case highlights the importance of recognizing gaze-evoked amaurosis as a sign of an orbital compressive lesion.The patient elected observation because his vision was mostly intact. Four months later, he developed significant worsening vision in the right eye with only temporal vision remaining. Visual acuity was 5/200 OD, and color vision was 0/13 OD. The disc appearance was unchanged.The patient underwent a 6-week course of radiotherapy with 28 fractions for a total dose of 50.40 Gy to the ONSM.6 One year after initial consultation in our clinic and 6 months after radiotherapy, his best-corrected visual acuity improved to 20/200 OD.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and progression of symptoms over two years, another MRI scan of the orbit is the most appropriate next step. Here's why:

1. Progression of symptoms: The patient's symptoms have evolved from initial double vision and right eye optic disc edema to graying of vision on eccentric gaze, suggesting a progressive condition.

2. Previous imaging findings: The initial MRI revealed trace enhancement at the orbital apex, which may have been an early sign of pathology that has since progressed.

3. Chronic optic disc edema: The prominent chronic-appearing optic disc edema in the right eye, along with the development of a relative afferent pupillary defect and visual field loss, indicates an ongoing process affecting the optic nerve.

4. Time elapsed: It has been two years since the initial MRI, and given the progression of symptoms and clinical findings, a new imaging study is warranted to reassess the orbital and intracranial structures.

5. Differential diagnosis: The clinical picture suggests a possible compressive lesion, such as an orbital apex tumor or meningioma. A new MRI would help to identify or rule out such lesions.

6. Guide further management: The results of a new MRI would inform the next steps in management, whether that involves medical treatment, surgical intervention, or further diagnostic tests.

An updated MRI scan would provide crucial information about any structural changes or lesions that may have developed or progressed since the initial presentation, guiding further diagnostic and treatment decisions.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed immature myeloid cells, which prompted a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).Ocular involvement in AML is common, occurring in 73% to 89% of eyes according to a postmortem study.1 Involvement of the retina is found more frequently than other ocular tissues. Typical manifestations of ocular involvement include retinal hemorrhages and dilation as well as tortuosity of the venules.2A small number of cases in the literature have described serous retinal detachments alone as the initial manifestation of AML.3-7 The mechanism is unknown but may be related to choroidal infiltration, with subsequent ischemia and dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium.5 While such a presentation is seemingly rare, it is increasingly recognized as a possible manifestation of AML. Furthermore, a recent study found AML to be the most common primary medical diagnosis for which inpatient ophthalmology consultations are requested, stressing the importance of familiarity with the possible ocular manifestations of the disease.8 A complete blood cell count should thus be considered in cases of serous retinal detachments of unclear etiology.Obtaining tests for syphilis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis (choice A) is prudent in a patient with unexplained retinal findings; however, oral corticosteroid therapy should not be started prior to obtaining a complete blood cell count to consider acute leukemia as the underlying diagnosis. In this patient’s case, treatment with oral corticosteroids should not have been initiated. Magnetic resonance imaging (choice C) is not necessary at this time without evidence of optic neuropathy or central nervous system dysfunction. Photodynamic therapy is a reasonable treatment for persistent CSR (choice D) but not for serous retinal detachments due to leukemia.The patient’s fundus findings were initially misattributed to CSR and then to Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada–like inflammatory disease once the disease worsened. This misattribution led to the initiation of corticosteroid therapy. The presence of multifocal pinpoint areas of leakage on fluorescein angiography, however, is atypical of CSR. While this pattern may occur in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, the absence of intraocular inflammation is atypical. Posterior scleritis can also present with serous retinal detachments; however, ultrasonography was not requested because there was no pain in either eye and posterior scleritis was not suspected.The patient began chemotherapy shortly after receiving a diagnosis of AML. Six weeks later, the patient reported marked vision improvement. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Examination and OCT findings revealed resolution of the serous retinal detachments. Fundus autofluorescence showed irregular and increased hyperautofluorescence likely due to reactive retinal pigment epithelial changes as well as a “gutter” showing where the subretinal fluid tracked inferiorly owing to gravity (Figure 2). Because results of the clinical examination and OCT had normalized by this time, fundus autofluorescence imaging was helpful for appreciating the extent of previous serous detachments.Fundus autofluorescence of the left eye shows irregular and increased hyperautofluorescence likely due to reactive retinal pigment epithelial changes as well as a “gutter” (arrowhead) where the subretinal fluid tracked inferiorly owing to gravity.",Ophthalmology,2019-01-01,2019,1,"A man in his mid-50s presented with painless blurry vision in the left eye.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and progression of this case, ordering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is the most appropriate next step.

The patient initially presented with unilateral central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR), which is typically a self-limiting condition. However, the case took an unusual turn when the patient experienced acute bilateral vision loss with subretinal fluid in both maculae.

This bilateral and sudden involvement, especially after an initial improvement, raises suspicion for a more serious underlying condition. While CSR can occasionally be bilateral, the acute onset and severity of vision loss in both eyes are atypical and concerning.

An MRI of the brain and orbits is crucial in this scenario for several reasons:

1. Rule out space-occupying lesions: Tumors or other mass lesions in the brain or orbits could potentially cause bilateral retinal detachment.

2. Evaluate for inflammatory conditions: Conditions like posterior scleritis or orbital inflammatory syndrome could present with similar symptoms.

3. Assess for vascular abnormalities: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or other vascular issues could potentially cause bilateral retinal detachment.

4. Screen for demyelinating diseases: Multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating conditions could rarely present with retinal findings.

While option A (testing for syphilis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis) could be considered, it's more appropriate to first rule out urgent neurological causes with imaging. Option B (observation and potential photodynamic therapy) is not aggressive enough given the acute bilateral vision loss. Option D (complete blood cell count) is not specific enough to address the concerning progression of symptoms.

In summary, the MRI is the most appropriate next step to ensure no underlying neurological condition is causing or contributing to the patient's sudden bilateral vision loss.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.
