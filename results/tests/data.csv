Melanoma,C,Melanoma,"The biomarker SOX10 is highly sensitive and specific in diagnosing melanoma,1 in conjunction with histologic findings and negative keratin staining, making melanoma the most likely diagnosis. Mutational testing revealed no BRAF or other sequence variations. An outside hospital staged the patient’s melanoma as cT4bN2bM0 (stage IIIC) and recommended a clinical trial of pembrolizumab plus cabozantinib for unresectable melanoma. After 10 cycles of treatment, there was continued local progression but slightly decreased uptake on a positron emission tomographic and computed tomographic scan. The patient then received weekly local immunotherapy with talimogene laherparepvec injections in the later course for 6 weeks with further progression. The patient presented to our center for a second opinion before proceeding with palliative radiotherapy.Although radiotherapy has beneficial outcomes in adjuvant and palliative settings,2,3 our multidisciplinary team recommended resection and reconstruction, followed by adjuvant therapy. The patient underwent left shoulder mass radical resection, including muscles, partial scapulectomy, left complete axillary lymph node dissection, and immediate lymphatic reconstruction (a microsurgical technique to reconnect lymphatics after nodal dissection to lower the risk of lymphedema). The muscles were imbricated over the pared-down scapular spine, and a collagen glycosaminoglycan dermal substitute was placed. Reconstruction was completed with a split-thickness skin graft. Surgical pathologic findings revealed invasive melanoma involving adjacent skeletal muscles, and it was 22.2 cm in its greatest dimension. All 33 resected axillary lymph nodes were normal, with no evidence of previously treated melanoma (ypT4bN0M0). Two years after resection, he had a well-healed skin graft with full range of motion and no evidence of lymphedema, and he returned to work in construction (Figure 2). He completed 1 year of adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy with no adverse events; his most recent systemic imaging showed no evidence of disease.Two years after radical left shoulder mass resection and reconstruction with collagen glycosaminoglycan dermal substitute followed by split-thickness skin graft.Locally advanced fungating melanomas are rare, and the anatomical location and size can pose challenges in management. There are case reports of fungating melanomas, mainly in the upper and lower extremities, and the treatment plans and outcomes varied in these cases.4,5 In the present case, because of the lack of surgical evaluation on initial presentation at the outside hospital, possible curative resection and nodal evaluation were not performed promptly. The patient did not have good clinical response to pembrolizumab plus cabozantinib in the trial; however, the subsequent imaging showed reduced uptake in the mass and axillary nodes. On histologic results, the left axillary lymph nodes were pathologically enlarged, but no pathologic metastases were observed; rather, there were reactive lymph nodes. A possible explanation is that there might never have been metastases in the axillary lymph nodes, and an initial axillary biopsy could have been pursued. Another theory could be that there was pathologic response. The original clinical trial could be considered as neoadjuvant therapy after our resection, and the treatment plan could have been further tailored on the basis of index lymph node response in the light of the PRADO (Personalized Response-Directed Surgery and Adjuvant Therapy After Neoadjuvant Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in High-Risk Stage III Melanoma) trial results.6-8 In addition, there are emerging clinical data on neoadjuvant treatments for advanced melanoma.9,10 The SWOG (Southwest Oncology Group) S1801 study, a phase 2 trial, reported that neoadjuvant pembrolizumab therapy improved event-free survival compared with standard adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy in high-risk resectable melanomas.10In conclusion, this educational case challenge demonstrates a rare presentation of a common malignant tumor. Multidisciplinary discussion is crucial for solidifying the best therapeutic options for patients with advanced melanomas.

Idelalisib-induced colitis,C,Idelalisib-induced colitis,"Idelalisib is a selective, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3Kd) inhibitor approved for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, and relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.1 Prescribing information in the United States contains a black box warning for fatal or severe diarrhea or colitis, hepatotoxicity, pneumonitis, and intestinal perforation.1 The standard dose is 150 mg orally twice daily.Gastrointestinal toxicity reportedly occurs in a third of patients receiving idelalisib, with grade 3-4 diarrhea and/or colitis occurring in 14% to 18%,2 although higher rates (64% any grade and 42% grade 3-4) have been reported with combination rituximab therapy.3 The most common presenting symptom is watery diarrhea. Mucus and/or blood in the stool, along with abdominal pain and cramping, is suggestive of colitis instead of simple diarrhea.The diagnosis of idelalisib-associated diarrhea should be considered in any patient developing diarrhea while taking the drug, although infectious causes must be ruled out. The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events can be used to define grades of diarrhea and colitis.4 Specific serological or stool tests are not available.5 The role of imaging is primarily to evaluate for bowel perforation, obstruction, and toxic megacolon.The time course to develop diarrhea after initiating idelalisib varies. Two distinct patterns of diarrhea have been observed: an early (within 2 months of initiating therapy) grade 1-2 diarrhea that responds well to conservative therapy, and a delayed form that is usually severe and requires more definitive therapy.2 Consistent with these descriptions, the median time to development of grade 1-2 vs grade 3-4 diarrhea is 1.5 months vs 7.1 months. It is important for clinicians to recognize that idelalisib can cause severe late diarrhea after patients seem to initially tolerate the drug.2 Several newer, targeted anticancer drugs (eg, ipilimumab) are associated with development of treatment-related diarrhea and colitis.6 Patients with gastrointestinal toxicity should also be evaluated for development of other immune-mediated adverse effects such as rash, transaminitis, and pneumonitis.Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is indicated in patients with grade 3-4 symptoms, frank bleeding, or persistent diarrhea despite supportive therapy.6 Colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy can demonstrate inflammatory changes, erosions or ulcers, mucosal erythema, congestion, granularity, or decreased vascular pattern.7 Normal results of endoscopic examination do not rule out colitis, and biopsies must always be performed.8 Cytomegalovirus infection should be ruled out via immunohistochemical staining. This patient’s biopsy demonstrated moderately active colitis with evidence of cryptitis, crypt abscess, increased apoptotic bodies, and crypt atrophy/degeneration with reactive epithelial changes. These findings, along with intraepithelial lymphocytosis, are the most distinct histopathological findings in idelalisib-associated colitis (Figure).7 Spontaneous colitis has been reported in PI3K knockout mice.9 From a mechanistic standpoint, it is hypothesized that immune dysregulation characterized by an altered cytokine profile, hyperresponsive macrophages, and cellular damage by cytotoxic CD8+ cells are responsible for colitis in patients receiving idelalisib.8,9Although follicular lymphoma can rarely involve the colon, an adequate biopsy sample is usually sufficient for diagnosis, or in this case, excluding gastrointestinal lymphoma. Graft-vs-host disease can cause crypt cell apoptosis but tends to be pauci-inflammatory. The absence of stem cell transplantation in this patient’s history is a clue. Cytomegalovirus can induce crypt apoptosis and cryptitis although viral inclusions are readily apparent. Mesenteric ischemia is classically associated with petechiae, abrupt transition between normal and affected mucosa, and rectal sparing on colonoscopy.Uncomplicated diarrhea is managed with supportive therapy including fluid replenishment, antidiarrheal therapy, and diet modification. Persistent grade 2 or grade 3-4 symptoms usually require steroid therapy; initial treatment with up to 1 mg/kg of prednisone or equivalent may be required. This patient’s condition did not improve with supportive therapy alone. Intravenous methylprednisone was initiated and transitioned to a 4-week oral prednisone taper. Her diarrhea improved and she had 2 to 3 bowel movements a day at last follow-up.Idelalisib can generally be continued with close monitoring in grade 1-2 diarrhea. For grade 3 diarrhea or in the case of hospitalization, the prescriber recommends withholding idelalisib until the diarrhea resolves, with possible reinitiation at a reduced dose.1 Further idelalisib therapy was refused by this patient.",Oncology,"A man in him 40s with relapsed grade 2 follicular lymphoma receiving therapy with idelalisib, 150 mg twice daily for the past 5 months, presented with 3 days of vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

Lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells were identified within the infiltrate. The epidermis was hyperplastic and demonstrated hypergranulosis (Figure, B). Results of an immunostain for syphilis were negative, and a serum rapid plasma reagin screen was nonreactive, excluding secondary syphilis as the primary source of the skin findings.Taken together, this patient’s clinical and pathologic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a lichenoid drug reaction secondary to pembrolizumab, one of the more common dermatologic immune-related adverse events seen with immune-checkpoint inhibition. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), a molecule normally found on the surface of T lymphocytes that maintains immune tolerance, which can be repurposed by tumor cells as an effective method of immune evasion.1 Programmed cell death 1 antagonists, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple malignant neoplasms, with immune-related adverse events similar across tumor types. Common dermatologic adverse effects of anti–PD-1 therapies include mucosal erosions, papular eruptions with overlying scale, and pruritus.2 The reported incidence of dermatologic immune-related adverse effects to anti–PD-1 monotherapy varies, but between 1.2% and 11% of patients receiving anti–PD-1 monotherapy experience a lichenoid cutaneous reaction, 12% to 25% experience pruritus, and 2.6% to 15% experience vitiligo.3-5 Regardless of tumor type, anti–PD-1–induced dermatitis typically presents as discrete papules or nodules limited to 1 region of the body or as larger plaques generally distributed over the trunk.2 Despite this variation in clinical presentation, histopathologic study of anti–PD-1 dermatitis almost always shows lichenoid infiltrates composed of CD4 lymphocytes within the dermis and CD8 lymphocytes within the epithelium.2The mechanism of lichenoid drug reactions has not been elucidated, nor has the mechanism of cutaneous reactions to anti–PD-1 therapy. The leading hypothesis is that antagonizing PD-1 leads to T-lymphocyte–mediated toxic effects directed against basal keratinocytes.6The time from initiation of anti–PD-1 therapy to cutaneous presentation varies, but cutaneous events have been reported from 3 days to 13 months after starting treatment and can also occur after discontinuation of treatment.2 Anti–PD-1–induced dermatitis is generally easy to manage with topical or intralesional glucocorticoid drugs and does not always require discontinuation of pembrolizumab or nivolumab therapy because they are typically not high grade per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology of Criteria of Adverse Events, version 4.03.2 There is evidence to suggest that the development of cutaneous reactions after anti-PD1 therapy may be associated with improved tumor response and increased patient survival.6,7 Future research regarding the association between immune-related adverse events and outcomes after anti–PD-1 therapy is needed and currently ongoing.The patient was prescribed triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% ointment to be applied to the affected area twice daily and a series of intralesional corticosteroid injections, with improvement in the appearance of the papules and plaques over the course of several months. He used the triamcinolone ointment for a total of 6 months. Findings on interval imaging revealed improved antitumor response after the development of the eruption; at the time of publication, the patient had been receiving pembrolizumab for 11 months.",Oncology,"A black man in his 30s presented for evaluation of papules and plaques on his bilateral lower extremities.

Peripheral blood smear also demonstrated blast cells.Cytological evaluation of anterior chamber aqueous humor aspirate demonstrating myeloblasts (white arrowheads) (Wright stain, original magnification ×500).Pseudohypopyon is the accumulation of malignant cells in the anterior chamber, which differs from hypopyon, the infiltration of leukocytes due to infection or inflammation. Hypopyon is often seen in endogenous endophthalmitis, an intraocular infection seeded from blood-borne infections, and immunocompromised patients are especially susceptible.1Candida is the most common pathogen.2 Systemic evaluation is warranted, including blood, urine, and vitreous and aqueous humor cultures.1 HLA-B27 uveitis is a major cause of acute anterior uveitis, which can include the development of a unilateral or bilateral hypopyon.1 HLA-B27 is a class I major histocompatibility complex molecule associated with inflammatory rheumatic and gastrointestinal disorders. A carefully elicited history can identify associated systemic diseases, and tests for HLA-B27 can help diagnose HLA-B27 uveitis. Herpes simplex virus is widespread and can be found in almost all cadavers of persons 60 years or older at death.3 Although ocular involvement is a well-known complication of herpes simplex virus infection, hypopyon is rare.1,3Pseudohypopyon can present in a variety of leukemias, although the highest incidence (up to 18%) is associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.1 In a 1989 prospective 2-year study of ocular findings of 53 patients undergoing AML treatment, none developed pseudohypopyon,4 illustrating the rarity of this presentation at that time. Since then, there have been multiple cases documenting the pseudohypopyon in AML.5-7 Increased reports of pseudohypopyon in AML should prompt evolving clinical approaches.This unusual manifestation of AML relapse portends a grave prognosis. Among 15 patients, 13 died within months after presentation of the pseudohypopyon.5-7 At time of presentation, all 15 had already developed diffuse systemic disease, but not all involved the central nervous system. In our patient, no evidence of leukemia was detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging and he declined a lumbar puncture. Evaluation of cases with diffuse disease accompanying pseudohypopyon revealed that 9 of 14 patients received a diagnosis of either M4 or M5 AML.6 In the 1 case of long-term survival after presentation of the pseudohypopyon, the patient showed no other evidence of extramedullary leukemic infiltration outside the eye.5 This uncommonly successful outcome impresses the importance of prompt identification of AML relapse. The immune-privileged microenvironment, coupled with low penetration of chemotherapeutics, may allow the anterior chamber to shelter malignant seeds, leaving it susceptible to relapse.8 Thus, noninvasive eye examinations can be leveraged to monitor for signs of relapse.Treatment is varied but can include systemic chemotherapy and localized radiotherapy.9 Our patient opted to discontinue treatment and entered hospice care.In summary, for patients with a history of AML presenting with ocular and visual changes, a high index of suspicion must be maintained for relapse of leukemia. A dilated examination combined with slit lamp examination serves as a noninvasive approach to look for signs of ocular involvement such as pseudohypopyon, leukemic retinopathy, or optic nerve infiltrates. Anterior chamber paracentesis can confirm a suspected pseudohypopyon.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2659373,"A woman in her 80s with a history of recurrent oral cancer presented with a new, biopsy-confirmed, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Her oncologic history began 16 years ago with diagnosis and local resection of a lesion on the palate. Cancer recurrence at the left buccal mucosa was identified and excised 10 years later. She then was diagnosed with 3 recurrences of SCC in rapid succession. Each malignant neoplasm was locally resected and the patient was also treated with adjuvant radiotherapy for the last episode. She remained asymptomatic, and a routine surveillance clinical examination uncovered a sixth lesion at the margin of a palatal graft.The patient’s medical history was also noted for a total thyroidectomy in the 1950s, complicated by recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. She had a history of tobacco use and stopped smoking cigarettes in the 1970s. Physical examination and laryngoscopy findings confirmed a painless lesion on the left side of the palate and immobility of the left vocal cord. No other mucosal lesion was identified. Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed to assess extent of disease and to plan treatment. The PET scan results showed focal fludeoxyglucose F 18 localization within the known oral cavity SCC (Figure 1A) and in a small, level IIA lymph node, located lateral to the upper right internal jugular vein. There was unexpected, prominent, metabolic activity in the medial and asymmetrically enlarged left vocal cord (Figure 1B).A, Positron emission tomography reveals focal fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake in biopsy-confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the left palatal graft margin (arrowhead).

Inflammatory reaction,C,Inflammatory reaction,"The inflammatory reaction is caused by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)–based (Teflon; The Chemours Company) injection augmentation. Given this patient’s extensive head and neck oncologic history, which includes 6 temporally separate SCC lesions, the hypermetabolic activity of the prominent left vocal cord initially generated concern for a malignant neoplasm. Establishing an accurate diagnosis involved extensive review of the history and previous imaging studies. The patient sustained paralysis of the left vocal cord following a thyroidectomy procedure and subsequently received PTFE-based injection augmentation.Computed tomography of the neck (Figure 2) showed unchanged medialization, expansion, and hyperdensity of the left vocal cord when compared with a computed tomographic scan performed 10 months earlier at an outside institution. Laryngoscopy results showed an immobilized left glottis without a focal mucosal lesion to suggest malignant neoplasm. Radiotherapy changes would be unlikely because they typically appear more diffuse in the neck region, and this patient’s radiotherapy port from previous adjuvant treatment did not include the glottis. The focal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake imaging seen on PET scan is consistent with the diagnosis of PTFE-induced granuloma. This inflammatory response is described as a multinuclear, foreign-body, giant cell reaction.1Axial computed tomography at the level of the glottis confirms a medially positioned, asymmetrically enlarged, and hyperdense left vocal cord (arrowhead) that was unchanged from prior imaging.This case underscores the importance of clinical history in the evaluation of laryngeal pathologic changes. Vocal cord paralysis without a history of prior surgery in this region would necessitate the use of fiber-optic laryngoscopy and radiologic imaging. In contrast, investigation of the cause of postsurgical vocal cord pathologic changes can be shaped by information available about prior treatment and the status of current disease. For this patient, the vocal cord findings were chronic, radiologically stable, and visualized at the PTFE injection site. A thorough clinical examination was performed to exclude additional abnormalities. Tissue sampling would be necessary if there was any change in laryngeal function or any evidence of a new mucosal abnormality. Our patient’s radiologic and laryngoscopic results supported a nonmalignant etiology, and attempt to biopsy the lesion could risk extrusion or exposure of PTFE.Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury is a known complication of thyroid surgery; a meta-analysis of 25 000 patients noted a 9.8% incidence of temporary and 2.3% incidence of permanent vocal cord injury.2 While operative techniques continue to improve, iatrogenic surgical injury was reported as the most common cause of vocal cord immobility in 435 patients over a 20-year longitudinal study. In this cohort, 33% of unilateral and 89% of bilateral postoperative vocal cord immobility was related to thyroid and/or parathyroid surgical procedures.3Fortunately, several treatment options can reduce the risk of aspiration and improve vocalization in affected patients.4-6 These treatments aim to fix the paralyzed cord medially and to allow adduction of the normal contralateral fold against its margin.4 Techniques used include injection augmentation, surgical laryngeal interventions, and reinnervation procedures.5,6 Following its introduction in the 1960s, PTFE remained the primary injected material for several decades,6 supplanted by other substances amid accumulating reports of delayed inflammatory reaction. The PTFE-induced granuloma can itself produce symptoms, occasionally requiring corrective surgery.7A few prior reports describe a similar appearance of laryngeal PTFE granulomas on PET scan.8,9 Because PTFE is used in multiple surgical applications, inflammatory reactions mimicking pathologic processes can be observed elsewhere. For example, following microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia, granuloma formation can mimic a posterior fossa lesion.10 While the procedure is rarely performed today, numerous patients who underwent remote PTFE injection undergo radiologic assessment for varied pathologic changes, including PET scan staging of neoplasms. Recognizing that a granuloma may mimic a malignant neoplasm can prevent inaccurate diagnoses and obviate the need for additional evaluation of a recognized, inflammatory, foreign-body response.",Oncology,"A man in him 80s with a history of recurrent oral cancer presented with a new, biopsy-confirmed, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Him oncologic history began 16 years ago with diagnosis and local resection of a lesion on the palate. Cancer recurrence at the left buccal mucosa was identified and excised 10 years later. He then was diagnosed with 3 recurrences of SCC in rapid succession. Each malignant neoplasm was locally resected and the man was also treated with adjuvant radiotherapy for the last episode. He remained asymptomatic, and a routine surveillance clinical examination uncovered a sixth lesion at the margin of a palatal graft.The man’s medical history was also noted for a total thyroidectomy in the 1950s, complicated by recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.

Pulmonary artery sarcoma,B,Pulmonary artery sarcoma,"The repeated CT scan demonstrated a persistent filling defect in the main pulmonary artery, with multiple pulmonary nodules, and no substantial hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The presence of multiple pulmonary nodules, along with the persistent filling defect despite multiple therapeutic interventions, should prompt the clinician to consider the possibility of undiagnosed malignant neoplasm. A full-body positron emission tomographic scan was performed, showing hypermetabolic activity within the lumen of the main pulmonary artery, along with multiple hypermetabolic pulmonary nodules. A CT-guided biopsy of a peripherally located pulmonary nodule demonstrated atypical spindle-shaped cells, consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic pulmonary artery sarcoma.In general, sarcomas of the pulmonary artery are rare, with fewer than 250 cases reported in the literature.1-3 Clinically, these patients experience progressive intraluminal growth of the tumor, eventually causing severe right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.4 The most commonly reported symptoms include dyspnea, chest pain, nonproductive cough, and hemoptysis. Physical examination may reveal evidence of right ventricular systolic dysfunction, including elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema.5 The pattern of metastasis is typically hematogenous, with predilection for the lung; nodal metastases are uncommon.6 Patients with pulmonary artery sarcoma generally have a poor prognosis, with reported median overall survival ranging from less than 2 months in patients with metastatic disease to several years or more in patients with localized disease who undergo complete surgical resection.7Several clinical findings were suggestive of a diagnosis other than venous thromboembolism in this case, including a therapeutic international normalized ratio on admission to the hospital, the lack of response to thrombolytic therapy, and the presence of multiple pulmonary nodules on imaging. Although vascular malignant neoplasms, specifically tumors involving the great vessels, are generally uncommon, they should remain on the differential diagnosis in the appropriate clinical setting. Other diagnoses to be considered include locally invasive lung or mediastinal tumors, fibrosing mediastinitis, certain pulmonary infections (such as tuberculosis), and tumor emboli.5 Misdiagnosis of pulmonary artery sarcoma as pulmonary embolism has been well documented in the literature.8 Certain radiographic findings, such as extraluminal tumor extension, can suggest the presence of pulmonary artery sarcoma. However, these findings may not appear until late in the clinical course, when the tumor has become inoperable. The early use of positron emission tomography in these patients to visualize the hypermetabolic state of tumor cells may help clinicians more clearly differentiate neoplastic processes, such as pulmonary artery sarcoma, from pulmonary embolism.9The treatment of pulmonary artery sarcoma is controversial, with limited data available to guide clinical decision making. For patients with metastatic angiosarcomas, there is evidence of improved survival following treatment with combination chemotherapy regimens including ifosfamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride.10 One retrospective analysis found a median overall survival of 11 months in patients receiving doxorubicin-based regimens, compared with approximately 2 months in patients not receiving systemic chemotherapy.10 For the patient described in this clinical challenge, there was concern that the large volume of intravenous fluid associated with the use of ifosfamide would cause further deterioration of her right ventricular function. For this reason, she was initially treated with single-agent doxorubicin.A few weeks after hospitalization, the patient’s condition deteriorated substantially, with profound dyspnea and clear signs of respiratory distress. After a lengthy discussion with the patient and family, she was transitioned to hospice care and died shortly thereafter.",Oncology,"A man in him 70s with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and venous thromboembolism presented to the hospital with 2 months of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion.

Lymphomatoid papulosis,C,Lymphomatoid papulosis,"Lymphomatoid papulosis (LP) is characterized by chronic and recurrent cutaneous papules and nodules that spontaneously regress without treatment.1 The disease is more common in males, with a median age of 50 to 55 years at diagnosis. The life span of skin lesions typically ranges from 4 to 8 weeks but may last up to several months. Lesions are usually less than 2 cm in diameter and may occur in a solitary pattern or multiple crops involving any part of the body. Some patients have associated pruritus, which may heal with scar formation; however, accompanying constitutional symptoms are absent in most cases. Early lesions typically show a limited number of perivascular lymphocytes; however, large atypical cells accumulate in the advanced lesions.1 Furthermore, neutrophilic infiltration is frequently observed in the epidermis of the involved lesions.1Lymphomatoid papulosis is classified as a primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder along with primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL).2 Accordingly, LP is uniformly positive for CD30, and may be positive for CD25, CD71, CD3, CD4, CD8, and HLA-DR depending on subtypes.1 There are 6 major histopathologic subtypes (types A-E, LP with 6p23.5 rearrangement).3 Type A, the most common subtype, is characterized by a wedge-shaped infiltration of large atypical CD30-positive and inflammatory cells resembling Hodgkin lymphoma. Type B and C lesions show small and large atypical CD30-positive cell infiltration resembling mycosis fungoides (MF) and ALCL, respectively. Type D is characterized by epidermotropic infiltration of atypical CD30-positive/CD8-positive lymphoid cells resembling primary cutaneous cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma, and type E shows angiocentric infiltration of CD30-positive/CD8-positive small to large pleomorphic cells in dermis and blood vessels.3CD30 has been shown to interact with CD30L to activate the nuclear factor–κB pathway regulating cell death and proliferation in active B and T cells, but the mechanistic role of CD30 in LP remains unexplained.4 Other chromosomal and genetic abnormalities such as aneuploidy have been identified in LP although t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, a characteristic marker of systemic ALCL, is typically absent in LP.5 The underlying mechanisms of spontaneous regression in LP are largely unknown, although several hypotheses, including low and high expression of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 family proteins and higher apoptotic vs proliferation ratio, have been suggested.6Owing to variability in the results of histopathologic analysis depending on evolutionary course of disease, LP is often misdiagnosed. As well, the histologic patterns and immunophenotypes largely overlap with other cutaneous lymphoid malignant neoplasms such as primary cutaneous ALCL, transformed MF, Sézary syndrome, and adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. Because benign skin lesions from pityriasis lichenoides, lymphomatoid drug eruption, viral infection, and insect bites can mimic LP, a thorough history and physical examination, viral serologic testing, and expert pathologic review are essential in differentiating LP from other benign disease. Clinical features pointing toward a disorder other than LP include constitutional complaints, lymphadenopathy, and organomegaly. Moreover, molecular workup such as TCR gene rearrangement, flow cytometry, immunohistochemical staining, and cytogenetic testing is essential to differentiate LP from other malignant neoplasms including ALCL, MF, Sézary syndrome, and T-cell leukemia and lymphoma.The life expectancy of patients with LP is similar to that of the general population, but 10% to 25% develop other types of lymphoid malignant neoplasms such as MF (61%), cutaneous ALCL (26%), Hodgkin lymphoma (4%), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (4%).7 Male sex, subtypes B and C, and TCR-γ gene rearrangement have been shown to be associated with increased risk of lymphoma.7,8 Although the mechanisms of transformation remain elusive, monoclonal TCR gene rearrangement has been identified in both cutaneous lesions of LP and associated lymphoid malignant cells, supporting the clonal relationship between these 2 entities.9Asymptomatic patients with LP do not need treatment, and a watch-and-wait strategy is reasonable for them. Our patient remains on active surveillance without any new lesions at the time of publication. In symptomatic patients with extensive disease, oral methotrexate is the treatment of choice and efficacious at weekly doses of 5 to 25 mg.10",Oncology,"A patient in their 30s with no medical history reported a 2-year history of waxing and waning pruritic papules involving their left popliteus, contralateral popliteus, groin, and penis with each lesion occurring at different time points.

Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis,C,Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis,"Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells and blocks the interaction with programed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2, resulting in T-cell activation and proliferation.1 The enhanced immune response associated with nivolumab improves antitumor immunity; however, it is also associated with various immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Based on pooled data from clinical trials of nivolumab, the most common irAE was skin related. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, and endocrine systems were among the other systems that were affected.1Inflammatory arthritis is a reported irAE associated with nivolumab, with a prevalence of approximately 2%.2 Most patients (65%) present with polyarticular inflammatory arthritis with involvement of small and/or large joints.2 Many of these patients do not develop autoantibodies like rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated peptide antibody and are thus seronegative. In a cohort of 9 patients who developed arthritis during nivolumab therapy, 5 patients progressed to polyarticular arthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis, without any evidence of autoantibodies or notable bone erosions. These patients required a much higher dose of systemic steroids than those without polyarticular arthritis, and the arthritis persisted for several months after stopping nivolumab.3 In another case series, the authors described patients who developed seropositive rheumatoid arthritis shortly after receiving nivolumab, raising the concern that nivolumab may unmask underlying autoimmunity.4 In 1 report, a patient developed deforming arthritis during nivolumab therapy; however, imaging did not reveal erosions or joint damage.5The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends a high index of suspicion for irAEs with any new symptoms after initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).6 Timely referral to a rheumatologist is recommended. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy may be continued with close monitoring for grade 1 toxic effects except in the setting of some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxic effects. However, ICIs should be withheld in patients with grade 2 or higher toxic effects, and systemic corticosteroid therapy should be added, with a slow taper as needed. In patients who are unable to taper prednisone, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs may be offered, with methotrexate, leflunomide, or a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor as potential options.6There may be some concern about whether steroids affect the efficacy of ICIs;7 however, in a large cohort study in which steroids were used to treat irAEs, steroid use did not appear to affect progression-free survival.8 Conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (eg, methotrexate) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors used for ICI-related irAEs also did not appear to affect the overall response rate or survival outcome.9,10 These studies are reassuring and suggest that early and appropriate management of arthritis may be possible without affecting the antitumor response of ICIs.Herein, we describe a patient with partially treated, seronegative inflammatory erosive arthritis that developed after the use of nivolumab. This is the first case, to our knowledge, of inflammatory arthritis associated with nivolumab that led to profound, irreversible joint damage. In this patient, nivolumab was continued for a year despite the ongoing inflammatory arthritis, which was partially treated.In the setting of inflammatory arthritis associated with ICIs, if the arthritis is not adequately treated, it could lead to erosive and deforming arthritis, underscoring the need for early recognition and appropriate management to prevent such deforming joint damage. Persistent subclinical inflammation was evident on magnetic resonance imaging even after discontinuation of nivolumab therapy. We recommend having a thorough discussion with patients about the potential risks vs benefits of various antirheumatic drugs for adequate treatment of arthritis to prevent significant joint damage, long-term morbidity, and implications for antitumor response.",Oncology,"A 58-year-old white patient with history of metastatic human papillomavirus–positive cervical adenocarcinoma presented with multiple joint deformities.

Leukemia cutis (LC),C,Leukemia cutis,"Post-SCT extramedullary relapse of AML is very rare with an incidence of 0.02% to 20.00% and may occur in an isolated fashion or in combination with medullary relapse.1 Myelomonocytic and monocytic subtypes are most commonly associated LC,2,3 and its incidence is higher in pediatric population. Most of the LC cases are described in patients with AML; however, it can also develop in myelodysplastic syndrome, accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.4The common sites of extramedullary AML are skin, bone, periosteum, soft tissue, and lymph nodes.5 Other commonly reported sites are those with less rigorous immune surveillance including testes, ovaries, and the central nervous system.5 Therefore, patients may present with soft tissue masses or lymphadenopathy and life-threatening complications such as spinal cord compression and extremity paresis.5 Cutaneous manifestations in LC are characterized by infiltration of leukemic cells into epidermis or dermis, causing single-to-multiple erythematous nodular or papular lesions that may be accompanied by ecchymosis, palpable purpura, bullous lesions, erythroderma, or ulcers. Most patients who received allogeneic SCT require post-SCT immunosuppressive agents to prevent graft-vs-host disease. Therefore, differential diagnoses of new skin lesions associated with recurrent fever are broad—including bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, and disease relapse—rendering LC a diagnostic challenge, especially when the marrow exam is negative.Risk factors associated with extramedullary relapse include French-American-British AML subtypes M4/M5 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.5; P = .02), age 18 years or younger (HR, 3.3; P = .006), pre-SCT extramedullary leukemia (HR, 4.6; P < .001), and refractory disease at the time of SCT (HR, 2.6; P = .02)1. Other cytogenetic abnormalities including del(5q) (32.1%), monosomy 7 (10.8%), trisomy 8 (10.4%), trisomy 4 (4.4%), del(20q) (2.4%), monosomy 16 (2.3%), and trisomy 11 (2.2%) are frequently associated with extramedullary leukemia6; however, their significance in the post-SCT relapse setting remains to be answered. The pathogenesis of extramedullary infiltration is ill-defined. Extramedullary migration is presumably initiated by altered expression of adhesion molecule that allows for the separation of leukemic cells from the bone marrow and mobilization into blood circulation.6 In a prior study7 of 331 patients with de novo AML, the CD56 positivity (defined as at least 20% of blasts expressing CD56 on flow-cytometry) was shown to be associated with significantly higher rate of extramedullary disease compared to CD56 negativity (53.1% vs 29.2%; P = .01), suggesting that CD56 may mediate extramedullary migration or tissue invasion. However, there was no significant intergroup difference in leukemic skin infiltration (3.1% vs 3.1%; P > .99), questioning the role of CD56 in LC pathogenesis7.Two-years overall survival rate in patients with extramedullary relapse was shown to be 11% to 38%, and the prognosis depends on the presence of concurrent medullary disease. Solh et al8 reported a significantly better 6-month survival rate in patients with isolated extramedullary relapse (69%) compared with those with medullary relapse (27%) or combined medullary and extramedullary relapse (8%).There is no standard treatment established for LC. Since graft-vs-leukemia effect plays an important role for cutaneous disease control, tapering immunosuppressive agents should be considered as an initial approach in patients without active graft-vs-host disease.6 In patients with good performance status and younger age, systemic chemotherapy could be a reasonable option as a next step. Previous retrospective study in 257 patients with AML and post-SCT extramedullary relapse showed nominally longer median survival with systemic chemotherapy compared with no treatment (120 vs 25 days)1. Adding donor lymphocyte infusion into the systemic chemotherapy resulted in further improvement in median survival (226 vs 120 days).1 Therefore, donor lymphocyte infusion  should be strongly considered if it is available. In patients who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy, DNA hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine could be an alternative option as shown in a recent case study.9 Hypomethylating agents induce leukemic cell differentiation as well as increase the expression of the human leukocyte antigen and tumor-associated antigens, which may potentiate the graft-vs-leukemia effect.10 In our patient, cyclosporine was tapered and azacitidine (75 mg/m2/d for 7 days) was started based on his poor performance status. The patient completed total 4 cycles of azacitidine treatment, and his disease is currently stable and has been for 8 months.",Oncology,"A 69-year-old woman with a history of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) monocytic type presented with intermittent fever and fatigue 2 months after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT).

Her disease recurred 1 year later, and she underwent haplotype-matched allogeneic SCT 8 months prior to admission. Two months prior to admission, she developed graft-vs-host disease requiring high-dose prednisone, rituximab, and intravenous immunoglobulin. At the time of admission, she was receiving prednisone (40 mg/d) and tacrolimus for graft-vs-host disease and prophylaxis of infection with levofloxacin, valacyclovir, posaconazole, and thrice weekly dapsone. The patient lived with her family, including her son who recently had a cough. She was born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States 3 decades prior. She denied recent travel.On examination, her temperature was 38.3° C, pulse of 115 beats/min, blood pressure of 110/50 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed tachycardia, increased work of breathing and bibasilar crackles without wheezes. Her laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 4.2 × 106/mL (normal range, 3.4-10 × 106/mL), hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL (normal range, 12-15.5 g/dL [to convert g/dL to g/L, multiply by 10]), platelets of 45 × 106/mL (normal range, 140-450 × 106/mL), and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL (normal range, 0.5-1.0 mg/dL [to convert mg/dL to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). A chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral opacities without pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Initial empirical treatment included vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and oseltamivir. On hospital day 2, she was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.

We considered infectious etiologies to be most likely given this patient’s profound immunosuppression, which included respiratory viruses (eg, parainfluenza, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus), cytomegalovirus, PJP, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.1 Among the provided answers, B is correct because the other infections are unlikely to present with diffuse ground-glass opacities on chest CT.In addition to her broad-spectrum coverage, she was started on intravenous TMP/SMZ (10 mg/kg/d) with methylprednisolone for PJP, as well as intravenous ganciclovir for possible cytomegalovirus. A broad respiratory viral panel returned negative for common respiratory pathogens. Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were negative, as were tests for Legionella, blastomycosis, and histoplasmosis. The serum β-D-glucan was more than 500 pg/mL (normal level, <60 pg/mL), galactomannan index was 0.15 (normal index, <0.5) and lactate dehydrogenase was 590 U/L (normal level, <199 U/L [to convert U/L to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). A cytomegalovirus  polymerase chain reaction returned at 2110 IU/mL, increased from 721 IU/mL 2 weeks prior. Bronchoscopy revealed numerous cyst forms on methenamine silver stain, consistent with Pneumocystis jiroveci.Despite treatment with high-dose TMP/SMZ and methylprednisolone, her respiratory and hemodynamic status did not improve, and she remained on multiple vasopressors. Her course was complicated by persistent respiratory failure owing to persistent infection and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome. She died on hospital day 48.Infectious pulmonary complications after SCT remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.2 The incidence of pneumonia 1 year after SCT ranges from 18% to 26% depending on the type of SCT.3 When an organism is identified, the most common culprits are bacterial (22%) and viral (21%) causes.3 Infection with PJP is less common (0.5%-5%), especially with prophylactic agents, but can occur.3-6 Graft-vs-host disease, lymphopenia, and age increase the risk of pneumonia.3,5,6 Despite treatment, death due to PJP in post-SCT patients is 30% to 50%.3,7 Poor prognostic factors include radiographic evidence of diffuse lung involvement and prolonged steroid use.7The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend PJP prophylaxis for at least the first 6 months after allogeneic SCT and in patients receiving T-cell depleting agents or high-dose steroids.8 Studied regimens include TMP/SMZ, dapsone, atovaquone and pentamidine.9 Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is the preferred agent in high-risk patients (ie, those receiving high-dose steroids),8 barring any absolute contraindications such as renal failure, severe cytopenias, or sulfa allergies. Patients receiving thrice-weekly dapsone vs TMP/SMZ have a higher relative risk (18.8) of developing PJP, but daily dapsone may be equally effective, though should be reserved for low-risk patients.4,10This patient was taking dapsone because of a historic allergy to sulfa (documented prior to SCT) which had been dosed thrice weekly. The case illustrates that PJP breakthrough in post-SCT patients still occurs despite prophylaxis, particularly in patients taking thrice-weekly dapsone, an inferior regimen when compared with daily dapsone and daily or thrice-weekly TMP/SMZ. The index of suspicion for PJP must remain high for patients with suppressed cellular immunity, especially in patients with imaging findings demonstrating diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities. Importantly, this case underscores that the type, dose, frequency, and adherence to prophylaxis affect overall protection.",Oncology,"A 67-year-old man with a history of peripheral T-cell lymphoma after an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) presented with 3 days of fever, weakness, and dyspnea.He was diagnosed with stage IV peripheral T-cell lymphoma 3 years prior and was initially treated with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and doxorubicin.

Immediately following workup with noncontrast abdominal ultrasonography, he experienced intense flushing and vomiting. Subsequent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified a 5-cm thoracic paraspinal mass (Figure, A).

Mastocytoma,B,Mastocytoma,"Spine magnetic resonance imaging revealed an unresectable paraspinal mass with neural foramen encroachment and encasement of the aorta (Figure, A). Biopsy findings revealed a monomorphic infiltrate of medium-sized round cells with abundant amphophilic hypogranular cytoplasm (Figure, B), positive for CD117 (also known as KIT), tryptase (serine protease stored in mast cells), and CD2. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated aggregates of more than 15 mast cells, negative for point variation (formerly mutation) of codon 816 on KIT (KIT D816V), with no evidence of an associated hematologic neoplasm, supporting a diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis (SM).Mastocytomas typically present as cutaneous lesions in children and are characterized by a clonal proliferation of morphologically unremarkable mast cells that undergo spontaneous resolution at puberty. Mastocytomas in adults are unusual; extracutaneous presentations are exceedingly rare1,2 and should prompt thorough evaluation for SM.The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for SM3 require the presence of the major criterion (multifocal infiltrates of >15 mast cells in bone marrow or other extracutaneous tissue) and 1 minor criterion, or the presence of 3 minor criteria—atypical morphology of mast cells, KIT D816V variation, mast cells expressing CD25, or elevated serum total tryptase. Systemic mastocytosis is further divided into 5 subvariants ranging from indolent SM to mast cell leukemia. In this patient, the multidisciplinary team agreed that the presence of paraspinal masses encroaching on the spinal cord was sufficient to classify it as aggressive SM (World Health Organization diagnostic criteria requires SM and end-organ damage). Because many patients with SM also present with associated hematologic neoplasms, their prognosis is largely dictated by the associated hematologic neoplasm. A series of 342 patients with SM4 revealed that 12% presented with aggressive SM without an associated hematologic neoplasm. Median survival for these patients was 41 months, with 5% ultimately progressing to leukemia.Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) refers to episodic symptoms (anaphylacticlike) related to mast cell mediator release, largely histamine and prostaglandins. Multiple potential triggers have been described, including manual manipulation (Darier sign), surgery, drugs, and sudden temperature changes. This patient experienced mast cell activation syndrome with severe flushing and gastric distress immediately following abdominal ultrasonography. Ultrasound-induced mast cell degranulation has been reported only in animals,5 and while the mechanism of action is unknown, acoustic agitation of mast cell plasma membranes has been hypothesized.6 Mast cell activation syndrome can be managed with avoidance of triggers and with antimediator therapy, such as H1/H2 blockers, corticosteroids, antileukotrienes, and intramuscular epinephrine for severe cases.Aggressive SM warrants treatment given the risk of organ compromise. Although enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged, systemic therapies with known activity against SM include cladribine,7 midostaurin,8 interferons,7 and imatinib9 (only for patients without KIT D816V variation). Furthermore, nonsurgical localized management of aggressive SM and mastocytomas has been seldom reported in humans and is typically reserved for palliation of local symptoms.1 Disease that is refractory to medical therapies should prompt evaluation for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.10Because of progression of paraspinal disease following treatment with cladribine, midostaurin, and imatinib, the patient in this case underwent palliative spinal radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant consisting of myeloablative total body irradiation (12 Gy in 8 fractions twice daily). Despite our concerns of MCAS in this patient following 2 separate courses of radiotherapy, we have observed that radiotherapy is a poor trigger for MCAS.Three years following allogeneic transplant, the patient was found to have elevated serum tryptase levels in the setting of severe anaphylaxis episodes and confirmation of recurrent SM by bone marrow biopsy. Given his poor prognosis, severe histamine-related symptoms requiring at-home intravenous diphenhydramine infusions, and lack of subsequent treatment options, his death was aided at home per the Oregon Death With Dignity Act, nearly 4 years from diagnosis.",Oncology,"A 41-year-old patient presented with a 7-month history of episodes of back and abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and flushing.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2802569,"A 76-year-old woman presented with a palpable left axillary mass. When she was 36 years old, she underwent a hysterectomy due to abnormal uterine bleeding and was taking estradiol to control postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms for the past 20 years. Bilateral diagnostic mammography revealed a high-density irregular mass in the left axilla with no nodules, architectural distortions, or microcalcifications in the breasts. Ultrasonography of the left breast showed a 4.6-cm lobulated mixed cystic and solid left axillary mass. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing 5.2-cm left axillary mass with no breast lesions (Figure 1A). The biopsy examination indicated high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features (estrogen receptor– and progesterone receptor–positive, ERBB2 [formerly HER2]–negative, and a high Ki67 index). Positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed only high uptake in the left axilla region.

High-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin,B,High-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin,"This patient underwent left axillary excisional lymph node biopsy, peritoneal washings, laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omental biopsy, and bilateral ureterolysis. Laparoscopy revealed that both ovaries were affixed to the pelvic peritoneum with adhesions, requiring bilateral ureterolysis. The uterus, cervix, and proximal fallopian tubes were surgically absent. On gross examination the distal fallopian tubes appeared unremarkable, and the left ovary appeared nodular. Given the clinical scenario, the fimbrial ends of the fallopian tubes were entirely excised and submitted for microscopic examination along with both ovaries. Microscopic examination revealed a residual 2.1-mm focus of high-grade serous carcinoma (Figure 2) involving the fimbrial end of the left fallopian tube. No omental involvement was seen. The immunostaining pattern was similar to that seen in the axillary metastasis prior to therapy. No residual carcinoma was identified in the left axillary lymph node. The patient’s cancer antigen 125 level was 13 U/mL before the surgery. Disease was staged as FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage IVB, and the patient received additional platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Test results were negative for germline pathogenic sequence variants, including BRCA1 and BRCA2.Hematoxylin-eosin–stained biopsy specimen of the left fallopian tube fimbria at low power (A) and high power (B) shows residual high-grade adenocarcinoma invading into the stroma (arrowheads).Although metastatic ovarian or tubal serous carcinoma typically first spreads locally within the abdomen or peritoneum, distal extra-abdominal involvement is well established.1 An isolated axillary mass rarely presents as the initial sign of ovarian or tubal serous carcinoma, and there are few cases reported.2-4 Unlike other patients, this patient was initially treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a presumptive diagnosis of an occult breast cancer with axillary metastasis. After histopathologic reassessment and additional immunostaining at our institution, the treatment plan was adjusted accordingly. Her initial diagnostic evaluation included clinical history, radiography, and pathologic examination. Given the pathologic findings, location of the malignant neoplasm, and positive hormone receptor expression, this case was misdiagnosed as breast cancer at the outside institution. Immunohistochemical staining was key to reaching the correct diagnosis.Clinical management of axillary nodal metastases of carcinoma of unknown primary (CUPAx) is challenging. A systematic review reported that 72% of the patients with CUPAx treated with prophylactic mastectomy had an occult primary cancer of the breast,5 which implied that a thorough investigation of breast origin might be appropriate and could avoid unnecessary surgeries. In these situations, immunostaining can offer more insight but only to a limited extent. Greco et al6 evaluated diagnoses based on molecular profile, immunostaining (median of 6 stains), and clinical findings, and reported that diagnoses among all 3 modalities were consistent for only 34% of the patients. Some markers may provide evidence implying the primary site; for example, TTF-1 and thyroglobulin are relatively specific for thyroid cancer, CK7 and GATA3 are highly suggestive of breast cancer, and CK7, WT1, and PAX8 are indicative of gynecological adenocarcinoma.7,8 While estrogen and progesterone receptors are frequently evaluated in breast cancers, they can also be expressed in ovarian cancer, and some evidence supports their prognostic value.9,10 Thus, infradiaphragmatic primary malignant neoplasm should not be completely excluded when positive hormone profiles are present.Ovarian serous papillary adenocarcinoma initially presenting as axillary lymph node metastasis is rare. When managing CUPAx, primary sites other than the breast should be explored. Thorough clinical history, physical examination, and histopathologic evaluation of the biopsy specimen in conjunction with immunostaining is invaluable in establishing a diagnosis.",Oncology,"A 76-year-old woman presented with a palpable left axillary mass.

Vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma,B,Vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma,"A right cervical lymph node core biopsy was CD15+, CD20−, CD30+, consistent with classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Liver biopsy revealed absent bile ducts with associated hepatocellular and canalicular cholestasis. There was no inflammation, lymphomatous infiltration, or necrosis present. Staining for CK7 showed a decreased number of small bile ducts (Figure 2). A diagnosis of vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS) secondary to stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma was made.CK7 Immunostaining highlighting bile duct damage and reduction in number of surrounding bile ducts (original magnification ×40).Hepatic involvement in Hodgkin lymphoma is common and more frequent in advanced disease.1 Etiologies of cholestasis in these patients include direct intrahepatic parenchymal involvement, extrahepatic biliary obstruction secondary to lymphadenopathy, drug toxicity, and underlying liver disease. Paraneoplastic manifestations of Hodgkin lymphoma include idiopathic cholestasis and VBDS. Ductopenia, defined as loss of interlobular bile ducts in more than 50% of portal tracts within a histologic specimen, helps distinguish between these 2 entities. An ideal biopsy sample is 3 cm long with at least 11 portal tracts (>20 is optimal).2 Immunostaining for biliary elements may improve diagnostic yield. Direct hepatic involvement from lymphoma is absent in most specimens.Vanishing bile duct syndrome was first described in 3 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma presenting with severe intrahepatic cholestasis. Liver biopsy demonstrated absent bile ducts and a characteristic “burned out appearance” of the portal tracts.3 The cause of VBDS is unclear, but biliary duct damage due to cytokine release from lymphoma cells seems likely.4 No specific biliary epithelial-associated autoantibody has been found in Hodgkin-associated VBDS.5 Our patient’s disease was positive for Epstein-Barr virus, but this has no known association with VBDS.Historically considered a poor prognostic factor, VBDS was associated with a 1-year overall survival of 43% in a series of 37 affected patients.6 Hepatic damage appeared reversible. Improved outcomes in VBDS correlate with more efficacious lymphoma therapies. Hepatic impairment at time of diagnosis often limits use of optimal cytotoxic therapy. Subtotal lymphoid irradiation (STLI) for patients with early-stage nonbulky Hodgkin lymphoma has failure-free survival rates of 81% to 93%, compared with 94% to 96% with chemotherapy alone.7 For patients with VBDS and early-stage disease, definitive therapy with STLI is a reasonable treatment option. Patients with advanced disease can receive high-dose steroids and ursodiol to facilitate administration of dose-reduced chemotherapy.8 Development of antibody-drug conjugates with improved hepatic tolerance such as brentuximab vedotin offers new options for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma–associated VBDS.Our patient initially received corticosteroids, with minimal improvement in his cholestasis. Given his advanced disease, young age, and excellent performance status, a trial of dose-reduced brentuximab vedotin (1.2 mg/kg) was administered. After 3 cycles of dose-reduced brentuximab, repeat imaging showed partial response. Cholestasis improved but the patient’s intractable pruritus persisted. He started biliary apheresis with resolution of symptoms after 15 sessions.9 He had a complete response after 6 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine and has returned to work with no sequelae of treatment 1 year after diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient receiving up-front brentuximab to achieve temporary control of VBDS prior to definitive treatment with conventional chemotherapy.",Oncology,"A Hispanic patient in their 20s with no known medical history presented with worsening abdominal pain over 5 days, persistent pruritus, and scleral icterus.

Cutaneous angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma,D,Cutaneous angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma,"The skin biopsy displayed diffuse infiltration of atypical lymphocytes and histiocytes in the dermis and subcutis, with proliferation of high endothelial venules (HEVs). The lymphocytes stained positively for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL6, and PD1 and were negative for CD20, CD30, or CD56, indicating a T follicular helper (TFH) phenotype. The Ki-67 labeling index was 40%. In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) demonstrated scattered positivity (Figure, C).A positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan showed increased glucose accumulation on the skin nodules (standardized uptake value, 7.7) and multiple lymph nodes (standardized uptake value, 1.7-4.9). The lymph node biopsy showed total effacement of nodal architecture, diffuse infiltration of medium-sized lymphocytes with pale cytoplasm in a polymorphous inflammatory background containing plasma cells and eosinophils, and marked proliferation of HEVs. The immunostaining revealed a TFH phenotype and expanded follicular dendritic cell (FDC) meshwork. Monoclonal rearrangements of T-cell receptor genes and positive EBER were also revealed. Then, the diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) was made. Genetic profiling identified hotspot RHOAG17V sequence variation, DNMT3AG543A sequence variation, and 2 TET2 frameshift sequence variations (Q1526fs and E1728fs) in both skin and lymph node tissues. Bone marrow biopsy showed no lymphoma involvement. The patient received chemotherapy and achieved complete remission after 6 cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone). His skin nodules subsided remarkably after the first cycle.Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is a common aggressive form of peripheral T-cell lymphoma arising from CD4+ TFH cells.1 Patients typically present with the acute onset of a systemic illness (fever, weight loss, and/or night sweats) and generalized lymphadenopathy. The lymph node biopsy demonstrates a polymorphous infiltrate including atypical lymphocytes that are positive for TFH cell markers and a prominent proliferation of HEVs and FDCs. Epstein-Barr virus infections are present in 66% to 91% of patients with AITL.2 Epstein-Barr virus–positive B immunoblasts are detected by in situ hybridizations for small nuclear EBERs in areas between FDCs. Sequence variations in TET2, RHOA, DNMT3A, and IDH2 are recurrent in AITL. The hotspot RHOAG17V sequence variation occurs in 50% to 70% of patients with AITL.2Skin manifestations occur in up to 50% of patients with AITL. These lesions can be categorized as nonspecific macular or papular eruptions mimicking drug/viral exanthemas and plaque-like or nodular lesions that are more likely to be recognized as lymphomatous.3 The histopathology of cutaneous AITL is not specific, usually presenting as nodular or perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes with or without cytological atypia.4,5 The positive rates of BCL6, CXCL13, and PD-1 in the skin lesion reach up to 43%, 62%, and 81%, respectively.5 Other extranodal involvement, including hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, frequently presents in AITL.Immune system–mediated abnormalities are common in AITL and can include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hemolytic anemia, cryoglobulins, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. There is no standardized treatment for AITL, and CHOP is the initial regimen in most cases. Although spontaneous remissions occasionally happen, AITL is an aggressive disorder with a 5-year survival of 32% to 41%.6Cutaneous sarcoidosis often presents as red-brown to violaceous papules and plaques. It is histologically characterized by noncaseating epithelioid granulomas and usually responds to steroids.7 Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm generally manifests as cutaneous nodules and bruise-like patches. Neoplastic cells infiltrate into the dermis and fat lobules with the expression of plasmacytoid dendritic cell–associated antigens.8,9 Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is universally extranodal. It is an EBV-driven B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder and can be ruled out by histologic characteristics.10Because the clinical symptoms and histopathological results in cutaneous AITL are nonspecific, the diagnosis is frequently delayed or missed. The quickly progressive skin lesions, multiple immunological abnormalities, generalized lymphadenopathy, and aberrant lymphocytic infiltration with TFH markers and EBER helped to coin the diagnosis of AITL. Recognizing the extranodal symptoms and signs is pivotal to the early intervention of this rapidly progressive disease.",Oncology,"A 61-year-old woman presented to our clinic with a 3-month history of rapidly growing and itchy cutaneous nodules all over the body. She denied systemic complaints such as weakness, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Oral glucocorticoids did not show any therapeutic effect. Her medical history was remarkable for mild anemia because of untreated hemorrhoids. Physical examination revealed numerous symmetrically distributed, well-defined, erythematous skin nodules on her back, buttocks, and limb extensors (Figure, A). Prominent lymphadenopathies on bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes were noted, with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 5 × 2 cm. Laboratory tests were significant for atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (count up to 6%), an elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio (9.21; normal range, 0.7-3.1), moderate anemia (hemoglobin level, 8.7 g/dL; normal range, 11.5-15.0 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (35 mm/h; normal range, 0-25 mm/h), and cryoglobulins composed of mixed polyclonal immunoglobulins.

Immunostaining for CD31 and D2-40 highlighted the vessel walls, and surprisingly, the staining pattern outlined the intravascular nature of all the neoplastic cells (Figure, C). Results of fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis performed on 4-μm tissue sections revealed 6p25.3 rearrangements (DUSP22 rearrangement). Positron emission tomography imaging did not show substantial lymphadenopathy or evidence of visceral involvement. The patient was referred to the Department of Hematology for further management, but she refused and then was lost to follow-up.Three variants of intravascular lymphoma have been described: intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL), and intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma (IALCL).1-3 In comparison with the counterpart of large B-cell origin and natural killer/T-cell origin, IALCL is exceptionally rare, and, to our knowledge, only 10 definite cases have been reported.3-6 Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma can show exclusive skin involvement or extracutaneous dissemination, such as to the regional lymph nodes or lung.3,4 Patients with IALCL documented in previous limited reports commonly presented with solitary or localized nodules or tumors. The presence of general symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and drenching night sweats, has been reported in some patients with IALCL.5,6 The DUSP22 gene is not specific for primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, but some cases of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma with DUSP22 translocation display prominent intravascular involvement.7,8 Of note, it has been postulated that most of the so-called IALCLs have intralymphatic origin and demonstrate a tropism to lymphatic channels, like the case reported here that was both D2-40 positive and CD31 positive.7 Because lymphovascular channels were involved with this patient, it was challenging to distinguish IALCL from systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Nevertheless, the lesions in the patient presented here were located exclusively on the skin during a 2-year period and lacked ALK and EMA expression, which supported categorization of this case at one end of the spectrum of the primary cutaneous disease process with propensity to lymphovascular involvement.8The main differential diagnoses of IALCL are large B-cell lymphoma and NKTCL. Large B-cell lymphoma expresses B-cell–associated antigens (CD20, CD79a, Bcl-2, MUM-1), and NKTCL is positive for CD3ε, CD56, EBER, and cytotoxic markers.4 Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma should also be differentiated from metastatic carcinoma. Physical examination and imaging studies can help provide the evidence of primary solid tumor, and immunohistochemistry aids in identifying the origin of the tumor cells.Treatment experience specific for IALCL is limited in the previous literature. The preferred mode of treatment for a solitary or few localized nodules or tumors is radiotherapy or surgical excision. In patients with only a few multifocal skin lesions, radiotherapy or treatment with low-dose methotrexate is preferred. Doxorubicin-based multiagent chemotherapy is used in the case of rapidly progressive skin disease or systemic involvement.4-7 Brentuximab vedotin, an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, has become a new standard of care for relapsed or refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma.9Compared with the other 2 types of intravascular lymphoma, intravascular NKTCL and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, IALCL has a favorable prognosis and generally follows an indolent clinical course,3-5 though relapse after treatment also has been reported. This case highlights the importance of establishing the diagnosis of IALCL because it may suggest a completely different treatment and prognosis.",Oncology,"A 79-year-old female patient presented with a 2-year history of asymptomatic erythematous-infiltrated patches and plaques on the right side of her scalp and face.

Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma,A,Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma,"Skin biopsy results revealed diffuse, nonepidermotropic infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells involving the entire dermis and extending to the subcutis (Figure, C). The infiltrating cells were medium sized, round to oval, with slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and distinct oval-shaped or kidney-shaped basophilic nuclei. They stained positively for CD45, MPO, KP-1, and CD43 and were negative for CD3, CD123, CD20, CD34, CD56, CD117, and CD138, compatible with primitive myeloid cells. Mitotic figures were noted. Bone marrow biopsy results showed no evidence of leukemic involvement. Results of subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis performed on paraffin sections of the skin biopsy did not reveal 11q23/MLL rearrangement or t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) rearrangement. Neither NPM1 nor FLT3 variation was detected in the skin lesion.Myeloid sarcoma (also known as extramedullary myeloid tumor or granulocytic sarcoma) is characterized by leukemic cells of a myeloid lineage infiltrating an extramedullary location and typically occurs in the following settings: as a forerunner of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients without leukemia, as the acute leukemic progression of myelodysplastic syndrome or blast crisis in chronic myeloid leukemia, or as relapse of antecedent AML.1-3 It has been reported at nearly every anatomic site and is most frequently encountered in the skin and soft tissues, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal tract.4 When the leukemia cells infiltrate specifically in the skin, cutaneous myeloid sarcoma has been referred to as leukemia cutis. There is a wide age distribution; however, myeloid sarcoma appears to be more common in the pediatric age group, with an incidence of up to 30% in children with AML vs 2% to 5% in adults.4,5Leukemia may manifest in the skin as a leukemid reaction or, less commonly, as cutaneous myeloid sarcoma. Leukemids represent nonspecific changes in the skin and most commonly result from bone marrow failure or humoral response to the primary tumor.1 In contrast, cutaneous myeloid sarcoma denotes the specific infiltration of neoplastic myeloid cells.1 It presents as multiple papules, plaques, or nodules with a characteristic reddish-brown or violaceous color. The most commonly involved region is the torso, although the head and neck regions and the extremities, as well as the mucosal region, can also be involved.5 Skin manifestation without evidence of systemic disease is referred to as aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma, but its presence is sufficient to establish a clinical diagnosis of AML. Previous studies have suggested that bone marrow involvement would become detectable in nearly all patients, with a mean interval of 10 months.5Recognition of this cutaneous phenomenon remains important for further classification and early diagnosis of myeloid leukemia. Nevertheless, diagnosis is often difficult owing to the presentation of isolated cutaneous findings outside the context of systemic disease.1 Histologically, cutaneous lesions show diffuse or nodular dermal infiltrates, with sparing of the upper papillary dermis. Involvement of the subcutis is common. Prominent single files of neoplastic cells between collagen bundles can be observed. The infiltrate is composed of immature myeloid cells. Markers usually expressed include CD45, CD68, and MPO. Lysozyme, CD34, CD13, CD14, CD15, and CD33 are positive in a variety of diseases.6 Few data on cytogenetic abnormalities in cutaneous myeloid sarcoma are available. The t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) and 11q23 abnormalities are the most commonly reported chromosomal abnormalities in myeloid sarcoma.7 Variations in NPM1 and FLT3 have been reported in 14% and 15% of patients with myeloid sarcoma, respectively.8,9Skin and bone marrow histologic findings are critical to confirm the diagnosis. Monomorphic skin lesions and the absence of peripheral nerve enlargement exclude lepromatous leprosy. Sarcoidosis can be considered but is less likely because of the fast growth of the skin nodules. Cutaneous lymphoma usually presents as polymorphic skin lesions, including irregular patches, plaques, and tumors. Expression of myeloid markers by the infiltrating cells helps to rule out cutaneous lymphoma.Patients with aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma should be managed in the same way as patients with bone marrow involvement. Outcomes are usually poor, although they may be slightly better than outcomes of primary or relapsed AML without extramedullary involvement.5 This patient was treated with 7 cycles of chemotherapy using hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (known as hyper-CVAD) regimens. He had been in remission for 2 years at the time of last follow-up.

Capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis,B,Capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis,"Capecitabine is an oral prodrug to fluorouracil with cytotoxic effects as an antimetabolite and is used often, in conjunction with oxaliplatin, in treating various gastrointestinal cancers, including in metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma, for which it has been shown to be a viable treatment option.1 Watery diarrhea has been well described as an adverse reaction, reported in up to 67% of cases. It is typically self-limited and appears to be dose- and schedule-dependent. Most cases are mild (common terminology criteria grade 1 or 2 diarrhea)2 and require no specific therapy aside from antidiarrheals for symptomatic relief. In rare instances of more severe diarrhea (common terminology criteria grade 3 or 4), patients may require dose reduction or a discontinuation of capecitabine. Only 11.4% of patients who experience diarrhea while on capecitabine have grade 3 or 4 diarrhea.3Reports of capecitabine causing terminal ileitis are very rare. The severity of diarrhea appears to be more profound than the self-limited, secretory diarrhea more typically seen with capecitabine exposure. Cases have been associated with severe volume depletion necessitating intravenous hydration, electrolyte derangement, need for parenteral nutrition, fevers, elevated white blood cell counts, and elevated serum and stool inflammatory markers.4,5 Endoscopy results reveal superficial, although extensive, ulcerations throughout the terminal ileum with mucosal edema and erythema. Histopathology results reveal crypt abscesses with a substantial amount of inflammatory cells and debris, which are predominantly neutrophils, although scattered eosinophils can be seen.Management includes prompt discontinuation of capecitabine, although careful consideration of the implications to the treatment of a patient’s underlying cancer and whether suitable alternative agents are available should be determined. Topical budesonide and even systemic steroids have been used in severe cases. Patients generally have full resolution of symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks of discontinuation.The differential diagnosis includes cytomegalovirus (CMV) ileitis, as this is common in patients with immunosuppression. Plasma or whole blood testing for CMV DNA, whether positive or negative, is poorly associated with tissue-invasive enteric CMV infection. A diagnosis of enterically involved CMV infection requires tissue biopsy. Histopathology results typically show the presence of basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies, although eosinophilic inclusion bodies can also be seen.6 Special staining is available for confirmation. No evidence of CMV was seen in this patient. Ileal metastasis in appendiceal adenocarcinoma is quite rare. Appendiceal adenocarcinoma more typically spreads to intraperitoneal lymph nodes or deposits into the peritoneum, causing malignant ascites or peritoneal carcinomatosis. Distant metastasis can also be seen, although other enteric involvement is rare.7 Small-bowel carcinoid and other primary neuroendocrine tumors of the small bowel can cause a syndrome of severe, watery diarrhea with associated crampy lower abdominal pain. These masses can appear on cross-sectional imaging as diffuse and concentric long-segment wall thickening with nearby mesenteric fat stranding, often mimicking radiographic findings of small bowel inflammation.8 Endoscopic findings can vary widely, from a discrete mass to the nonspecific appearance of inflamed tissue or even normal intraluminal appearance. The histopathology results for this patient’s specimens showed no evidence of malignancy.The patient in this case promptly received a diagnosis of capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis and achieved full resolution of symptoms within 2 weeks of budesonide therapy and capecitabine discontinuation.

Her disease recurred 1 year later, and she underwent haplotype-matched allogeneic SCT 8 months prior to admission. Two months prior to admission, she developed graft-vs-host disease requiring high-dose prednisone, rituximab, and intravenous immunoglobulin. At the time of admission, she was receiving prednisone (40 mg/d) and tacrolimus for graft-vs-host disease and prophylaxis of infection with levofloxacin, valacyclovir, posaconazole, and thrice weekly dapsone.

A broad respiratory viral panel returned negative for common respiratory pathogens. Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were negative, as were tests for Legionella, blastomycosis, and histoplasmosis. The serum β-D-glucan was more than 500 pg/mL (normal level, <60 pg/mL), galactomannan index was 0.15 (normal index, <0.5) and lactate dehydrogenase was 590 U/L (normal level, <199 U/L [to convert U/L to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). A cytomegalovirus  polymerase chain reaction returned at 2110 IU/mL, increased from 721 IU/mL 2 weeks prior. Bronchoscopy revealed numerous cyst forms on methenamine silver stain, consistent with Pneumocystis jiroveci.Despite treatment with high-dose TMP/SMZ and methylprednisolone, her respiratory and hemodynamic status did not improve, and she remained on multiple vasopressors. Her course was complicated by persistent respiratory failure owing to persistent infection and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome. She died on hospital day 48.Infectious pulmonary complications after SCT remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.2 The incidence of pneumonia 1 year after SCT ranges from 18% to 26% depending on the type of SCT.3 When an organism is identified, the most common culprits are bacterial (22%) and viral (21%) causes.3 Infection with PJP is less common (0.5%-5%), especially with prophylactic agents, but can occur.3-6 Graft-vs-host disease, lymphopenia, and age increase the risk of pneumonia.3,5,6 Despite treatment, death due to PJP in post-SCT patients is 30% to 50%.3,7 Poor prognostic factors include radiographic evidence of diffuse lung involvement and prolonged steroid use.7The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend PJP prophylaxis for at least the first 6 months after allogeneic SCT and in patients receiving T-cell depleting agents or high-dose steroids.8 Studied regimens include TMP/SMZ, dapsone, atovaquone and pentamidine.9 Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is the preferred agent in high-risk patients (ie, those receiving high-dose steroids),8 barring any absolute contraindications such as renal failure, severe cytopenias, or sulfa allergies. Patients receiving thrice-weekly dapsone vs TMP/SMZ have a higher relative risk (18.8) of developing PJP, but daily dapsone may be equally effective, though should be reserved for low-risk patients.4,10This patient was taking dapsone because of a historic allergy to sulfa (documented prior to SCT) which had been dosed thrice weekly. The case illustrates that PJP breakthrough in post-SCT patients still occurs despite prophylaxis, particularly in patients taking thrice-weekly dapsone, an inferior regimen when compared with daily dapsone and daily or thrice-weekly TMP/SMZ. The index of suspicion for PJP must remain high for patients with suppressed cellular immunity, especially in patients with imaging findings demonstrating diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities. Importantly, this case underscores that the type, dose, frequency, and adherence to prophylaxis affect overall protection.",Oncology,"A 67-year-old patient with a history of peripheral T-cell lymphoma after an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) presented with 3 days of fever, weakness, and dyspnea.They was diagnosed with stage IV peripheral T-cell lymphoma 3 years prior and was initially treated with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and doxorubicin.

Malignant acanthosis nigricans,C,Malignant acanthosis nigricans,"The keys to the correct diagnosis are the verrucous, hyperpigmented plaques in atypical sites (mucous membranes, palms and anogenital region), the additional paraneoplastic findings (tripe palms), and recent obvious weight loss. Most cases of acanthosis nigricans (AN) are benign and are associated with obesity and insulin resistance in which blood glucose and insulin levels are important for diagnosis. The disease is less commonly associated with a malignant neoplasm. Malignant AN is predominantly associated with gastrointestinal tract tumors, especially carcinoma of the stomach.1The gastroscopy findings revealed esophageal papillomatous polyposis and a submucosal mass involving the gastric angle. Biopsy results revealed that the mass was a mix of adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma (Figure 2). A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen showed a thickening of the gastric wall and multiple organ metastases. The results of biopsies of the thyroid and pancreas suggested metastases of gastric cancer. The patient was then transferred for further chemotherapy without any dermatological treatment and died 4 months later due to cancer progression.Histologic specimen of the gastric mass showed various types of cancer. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma had developed in the lamina propria of the gastric angle (hematoxylin-eosin stain, original magnification ×100).Acanthosis nigricans is a reactive skin pattern that presents as velvety to verrucous hyperpigmented plaques in body folds such as the axilla, neck, groin, and umbilicus. Malignant AN has a more striking clinical presentation involving unusual locations such as the oral cavity, conjunctiva, and palms, in accordance with the severity of the disease.2-4 It can occur with other cutaneous markers of internal malignant neoplasm, such as tripe palms and the Leser-Trélat sign.2,3 It is mostly associated with gastric adenocarcinoma, followed by pulmonary carcinoma, hepatic carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and ovarian cancer,2,3 arising either before or after detection of the tumor. The onset for most patients is between age 41 and 70 years.1 Patients with malignant AN are generally not obese but have experienced a recent weight loss. Histologically, malignant and benign AN cannot be distinguished from each other. Their major features are hyperkeratosis and epidermal papillomatosis with increased melanin in the basal layer of the epidermis. A thorough endoscopic and radiological screening for cancer is much more important than serological testing.Pathogenically, elevated levels of transforming growth factor α participate in tumor progression through autosecretion and paracrine secretion, stimulating keratinocyte growth via epidermal growth factor receptors. Insulinlike growth factor 1, fibroblast growth factor, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone α regulate melanocyte pigmentation and stimulate the growth of keratocytes, which also play roles in the pathogenesis of hyperplasia and hyperpigmentation.5The management of malignant AN should be focused on the underlying neoplasm. The efficacy of therapies intended to directly improve the skin lesions of AN, such as using topical retinoids or vitamin D analogs, is limited. Improvement or resolution of AN has been reported in patients successfully treated for the associated cancer.6 Nevertheless, the prognosis for malignant AN is poor since the cancer is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage. Patients may be misdiagnosed with eczema or other skin disorders during the early stages of the disease. Timely recognition of malignant AN could lead to earlier detection of the carcinoma and may improve the prognosis of these patients.",Oncology,"A 30-year-old patient presented with a 4-month history of widespread thickened, verrucous, hyperpigmented plaques distributed symmetrically on them body, especially on the axillae (Figure 1A), anogenital region, inguinal skin, and both palms, with slight itching.

Atypical lymphoid cells were positive for CD20, CD10, BCL-2 and BCL-6 (rare), and negative for CD5 and CD23. Immunostaining results for CD3 and CD5 revealed reactive T-lymphocytes and Ki-67 proliferative index was 50%. Spindle cells were positive for vimentin and CD10 (focal) and negative for pancytokeratin, S-100, and CD34. Positron emission tomography-CT demonstrated hypermetabolic activity in the scalp (SUVmax 3.3) and sacral lesions. Bone marrow biopsy results were negative for lymphoma. Given multifocal disease, a lumbar puncture procedure was conducted, with cerebrospinal fluid showing rare lymphocytes. Flow cytometry demonstrated an unusual population of B cells which were κ restricted, positive for CD19 and D20, and negative for CD5 and CD10. The extracranial mass resolved with the patient receiving dexamethasone 4 mg 3 times a day, as did her weakness and confusion. She received brain and sacral radiation (10 fractions, 20 Gy) and is currently asymptomatic and awaiting follow-up imaging and lumbar puncture.Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas are the third most common histologic subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphomas.1 They most frequently arise in the stomach; however, involvement of nongastrointestinal sites has been described.1 In a multicenter retrospective survey of 180 extragastric MALT lymphomas, none of the patients presented with dural involvement.1 Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the dura has been described in case reports as an indolent disease, typically presenting with isolated and well-defined meningeal involvement that mimics meningioma on imaging.2-5 Most of these cases occurred in women, and developed gradually with symptoms including headaches, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, seizures, and focal neurological deficits.6 To our knowledge, this is the first report of such aggressive presentation of dural MALT lymphoma in the literature.2-5,7-9 This case is unusual not only as an example of this rare site of MALT lymphoma involvement, but also in the uniquely aggressive tumor growth. The expansion of this patient’s tumor from unnoticeable to 8-cm diameter in less than 3 weeks is remarkable, as is the dramatic reversal in response to dexamethasone.Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma arises from either physiologic lymphoid tissue (ie, Peyer patches in the gut) or from acquired MALT that develops in response to infection or autoimmune disease (ie, Hashimoto thyroiditis or Sjogren syndrome).1 Although the central nervous system (CNS) lacks mucosa, MALT lymphoma is thought to arise from meningothelial cells.5 Under these inflammatory conditions a pathologic clone may overtake the normal population, giving rise to malignant lymphocytes that express general B-cell markers (CD19, CD20, CD79a), some complement receptors (CD21, CD35), but are negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD23, and cyclin D1 expression.2In general, MALT lymphomas carry a positive prognosis, with an estimated 5-year survival of 90% for extragastric MALT lymphomas.1 However, CNS involvement occurs so rarely that survival in this subtype has not been determined.2 Short-term follow-up of reported cases involving the dura demonstrates potential for complete remission following surgery and adjuvant therapy, suggesting a similarly positive outlook.2 The ideal treatment regimen for MALT lymphoma has not been determined, and typically involves a patient-specific combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. In general MALT lymphomas tend to be radiosensitive, responding well to low-dose radiation therapy.6 For this reason, there is a general preference for radiotherapy over chemotherapy in the treatment of localized MALT lymphoma. Data from a case series of patients with dural MALT lymphoma treated with radiation therapy suggests that MALT lymphoma of the dura is no different in this regard and the authors recommend low-dose and limited-field radiation therapy for focal, localized dural MALT lymphoma.10This case illustrates the importance of including low-grade MALT lymphoma in the differential for a rapidly enlarging scalp mass. The multifocal and aggressive presentation of this patient’s disease emphasizes the importance of systemic workup in what has previously been described as an indolent tumor.",Oncology,"A woman in her 80s presented to the emergency room (ER) with a 2-week history of enlarging left parietal scalp mass.

Attempts to taper immunosuppressive drugs failed because of a recrudescence of the inflammatory syndrome and pericardial effusion. The patient was admitted with fever of unknown origin with a surge of the inflammatory syndrome and pancytopenia. He reported night sweats beginning 3 weeks prior associated with fever and unintentional weight loss.

Bone-marrow biopsy results (Figure, C and D) showed hypercellular marrow with a diffuse interstitial infiltrate of large, centroblasticlike lymphoid cells and no features suggestive of plasmacytic or secretory differentiation. These cells were CD20+, CD5−, and CD30− and accounted for approximately 60% of the global cellularity. The large B cells were CD10−, BCL6+, and MUM-1+, a non-germinal center–like phenotype according to the Hans algorithm. Furthermore, B cells were BCL2+ and negative for MYC expression, and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed no rearrangements of the BCL2, BCL6, or MYC genes. Although immunostains for κ and λ light chains highlighted a small population of reactive plasma cells distributed in the marrow spaces, they did not produce specific staining in the lymphoma cells. Residual trilinear hematopoiesis was reduced, with no excess of blasts, and no evidence was found to support a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The lymphoma cells were negative for Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus 8.The diagnosis was consistent with the bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma (BLS-type LBCL).1 This subtype of diffuse LBCL (DLBCL) includes bone-marrow involvement with or without involvement of the liver or spleen and is often accompanied by severe anemia (100%), thrombocytopenia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (64%), and elevated LDH levels in the absence of lymphadenopathy, other extranodal masses, or a lymphoma history.1Primary bone-marrow lymphoma is restricted to patients with isolated bone-marrow involvement, but this patient also had splenomegaly. Intravascular LBCL may be diagnosed in bone-marrow specimens, but the lymphoma cells were diffusely distributed in the bone-marrow spaces and did not show a distribution restricted to the lumens of small vessels and sinusoids. T-cell/histiocyte-rich LBCL is a rare type of LBCL and commonly involves the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. In this patient, the T-cell/histiocyte-rich background was missing. A multifocal primary lymphoma of the bone was excluded in the absence of bone lesions.The bone marrow is an unusual site to establish the diagnosis of DLBCL, which typically presents with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes or extranodal masses; secondary bone-marrow involvement occurs in approximately 10% to 16% of patients with DLBCL, not otherwise specified.2,3 Bone marrow–liver–spleen LBCL could be considered an aggressive variant of primary splenic DLBCL that has spread into the bone marrow. However, primary splenic DLBCL usually presents with large splenic masses, or less often as diffuse leukemialike infiltration in the red pulpa,4 and is rarely associated with hemophagocytic syndrome.5 To our knowledge, few cases of BLS-type LBCL have been described. This aggressive lymphoma is characterized by severe clinical presentation and rapid evolution with high mortality and no specific infectious or genetic abnormality.6To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of long-lasting, paraneoplastic-refractory pleuropericarditis associated with BLS-type LBCL. The differential diagnosis of pleuropericarditis is large, including infectious causes, autoimmune and metabolic disorders, chemotherapy or radiation toxic effects, and neoplastic or paraneoplastic conditions. It is most often idiopathic (85%-90%), and only 7% of cases are described as neoplastic or paraneoplastic.7 Pericardial disease as the first manifestation of malignant neoplasm is uncommon and makes diagnosis difficult. In a retrospective study of patients with symptomatic pericardial effusion,8 newly diagnosed cancer accounted for the symptoms in one-fifth of the patients with initially uninformative basic workups. Furthermore, idiopathic inflammatory, refractory pleuropericarditis is often a challenging diagnosis, and malignant neoplasm should be ruled out. When studying the association of acute pericardial disease with malignant neoplasm, Imazio et al8 found an association of the lack of response of pericarditis to steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and an incessant or recurrent course of pericarditis with the presence of a neoplastic cause of the pericardial disease.In this patient, the initial manifestation of probable paraneoplastic recurrent pleuropericarditis with the absence of lymph node involvement and pancytopenia for more than 3 years made the diagnosis challenging to achieve with an ordinary CT scanner. This case illustrates the growing interest in PET-CT and bone-marrow biopsies in the assessment of idiopathic recurrent pleuropericarditis.",Oncology,"A 71-year-old woman had a 3-year history of a recurrent seronegative autoimmune constrictive pericarditis and pleural effusions, which were treated with pericardiectomy and prednisone and azathioprine.

Histopathology of the specimen from the left hip, but not other sites, revealed an atypical vascular proliferation that was consistent with angiosarcoma (Figure 2). While PET-CT results did not show evidence of visceral metastatic disease, there was evidence of intensely hypermetabolic soft tissue along the anterolateral margins of the hips bilaterally, as well as skin thickening along the anterior abdominal wall with mild metabolic activity. Angiosarcoma was seen on only 1 biopsy specimen, and a multifocal presentation of secondary angiosarcoma would be unusual. However, given his history and presentation, as well as the limitations of coverage of PET imaging, the possibility of multiple site involvement was still considered. Surgical intervention was deemed suboptimal due to poor definition of the true margins of the neoplasm and anticipated poor wound healing of the previously irradiated area. He was treated with 4 cycles of paclitaxel, and evaluation of response was difficult due to the admixed granulation tissue. Results from PET-CT showed no evidence of disease progression 4 months later, so further treatment with chemotherapy was discontinued.Hematoxylin-eosin—stained biopsy specimens of the left lateral hip. A, Epidermal ulceration with overlying fibrin deposition, superficial dermal edema and a marked hemorrhagic proliferation in the deep dermis. B, Atypical mitotic figures were seen.Angiosarcoma is a rare tumor, comprising only 2% of soft tissue sarcomas, with an incidence of 2 to 5 cases per 1 000 000 annually.1 It is associated with poor prognosis, high rates of local recurrence, and metastasis.2 The tumor originates from vascular endothelial cells, which grow along channels and sinusoidal and cavernous spaces; organize into vessels, masses, or nodules3; and can occur in most organs. On histopathology, they can be difficult to diagnose given some similarity with other vascular tumors3; however, the presence of dissecting growth pattern, protrusion of atypical cells into vascular lumens, and atypical cytomorphologic features of the lining are helpful features in differentiating angiosarcoma from other vascular tumors. They are more prevalent in men at a median age of 60 years. The cutaneous form is more common in elderly White men.4 To our knowledge, it has not been described in association with allogeneic HSCT or MF previously.The skin is the most commonly involved organ, predominantly on the head and neck.3 Chronic lymphedema and radiation therapy are primary risk factors, along with familial syndromes, environmental chemical toxins, and foreign bodies.4 Radiation therapy contributes to one-fourth of all cases.3 Immunosuppression may be a risk factor, although the effect is unknown, as angiosarcomas have been reported in kidney transplant patients who have subsequent immunosuppression.5Treatment usually requires a multidisciplinary approach, but the recurrence rate remains high. Surgical resection and therapeutic agents, such as cytotoxic therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, have been applied. Data are lacking regarding best treatment plans because angiosarcoma is so rare and much of the literature exists in case reports.6The diagnosis of angiosarcoma can be difficult to establish, as initial presentation can be mistaken for a bruise or hemangioma, and delays in diagnosis have been previously reported with a median of 5.1 months.7 As the tumor grows, further cutaneous signs may develop with tissue infiltration, edema, ulceration, and hemorrhage.4 Repeated evaluation is key when there is clinical suspicion of malignant transformation. In this article, we presented a case of a patient who developed a cutaneous angiosarcoma in the setting of a known history of chronic graft vs host disease following receipt of radiation to the sites to treat his underlying MF, ablative therapy for bone marrow transplant, and subsequent immunosuppression.",Oncology,"A man in his 50s presented with bleeding wounds and nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms. He previously received failed systemic and radiation therapy for tumor stage mycosis fungoides (MF). He had received 11 courses of extended beam radiation therapy, including 3 courses of total skin irradiation of 24 to 30 Gy, and focal irradiation to the left posterior thigh and hip/buttock with 2.5/3 Gy to 12.5/24 Gy, respectively, and the right posterior thigh and hip with 2 Gy to 20 and 26 Gy, respectively. Seven years before this visit, he underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). His post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which he received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, he developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and his forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. He underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on his left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on his right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. He was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole. Positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) results did not show evidence of visceral or extracutaneous disease.Recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on the left lateral hip.",what is your diagnosis?,What is your diagnosis?,Angiosarcoma,Granulation tissue,Opportunistic fungal infection,"Atypical infection, nocardia",a,1,1,1,1,male,0,0,55.0,51-60,,76,original

Fully treating these problem behaviors in ASD requires a careful evaluation of co-occurring medical and psychiatric disorders, developmental and family history, as well as an assessment for communication difficulties, maladaptive reinforcement patterns, and psychosocial stressors.1The 4-year-old boy described in this case had significantly impairing social communication deficits that arose early in development combined with patterns of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, the cardinal criteria of ASD (as described in DSM-5, criteria A-D). He demonstrated language impairment, motor skills delay, and suspected cognitive deficits. He also has at least 2 identifiable risk factors for a neurodevelopmental disorder: (1) premature birth and (2) 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.A careful medical evaluation in collaboration with his other clinicians ruled out medical problems that would account for his behavior. His behavior had been quite consistent over the past year and there were no recent psychosocial stressors. In the absence of other medical, psychiatric, or psychosocial factors, his behaviors most likely relate to the diagnosis of ASD with outbursts secondary to (1) deficient communication and (2) decreased tolerance for change and frustration.Behavioral intervention is first-line treatment for aggressive behavior in young children, and therapy based on the principles of applied behavior analysis has extensive empirical support in ASD. Several treatment models exist, including standard applied behavior analysis , pivotal response training, and the Early Start Denver Model. Parallel parent-training components can provide additional benefits. A functional behavioral assessment to identify triggers and understand the function of the behavior can help implement a behavioral intervention plan to decrease the target behavior, in this case, aggression and self-injury. While this patient benefitted from school-based therapies, he had not yet received applied behavior analysis –specific or other behavioral therapies at the time of evaluation. Unfortunately, access to behavioral interventions is often limited by a scarcity of trained clinicians.It is critical to evaluate the immediate safety concerns of each patient and determine whether the risk of injury to the patient or others justifies a trial of a medication to reduce the risk of injury.1 In these cases, medications should be carefully considered. Atypical antipsychotic medications have the best evidence for treating aggression and self-injurious behavior in children with ASD. Based on multiple randomized clinical trials,2 risperidone and aripiprazole were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of “irritability associated with autistic disorder” in children as young as 5 and 6 years old, respectively. The “irritability” target symptom definition was based on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability/Agitation/Crying subscale, which indexes aggression and self-injury as well as tantrums, crying, mood swings, and irritability. In any child, symptoms must be substantial to merit using this medication in the context of the potential adverse effects, which include sedation and an increased risk for movement disorders. Mixed receptor antagonists, such as risperidone and aripiprazole, are also associated with substantial weight gain and related medical problems, including type 2 diabetes. The addition of metformin has shown efficacy in reducing weight gain in children with ASD who are taking risperidone or aripiprazole.3 Some genetic conditions (including chromosome 16p11.2 deletion syndrome) are also associated with an increased risk of obesity,4 and aripiprazole may therefore be preferred over risperidone. While multiple lines of evidence point to abnormalities of the serotonin system in ASD, serotonin reuptake inhibitors do not show the same pattern of benefit in children with ASD that they provide in obsessive compulsive disorder; for example, a large randomized clinical trial of citalopram for repetitive behavior in ASD showed no overall significant benefits and increased adverse effects.5Autism spectrum disorder is an extremely heterogeneous disorder that appears to be a common final outcome of several factors, including genetic risk alleles, environmental insults, and developmental events.6 While chromosomal microarray testing can identify a clinically relevant genetic change in up to 10% of people with autism,7 in most cases we do not yet have evidence-based guidelines to clinically act on these findings. For these individuals (and those with idiopathic ASD), treatments target behavioral symptoms, such as the irritability and agitation experienced by this child.Our patient had a perinatal risk factor (prematurity) and a genetic risk factor (16p11.2 microdeletion). While there is a markedly increased risk for ASD in 16p11.2 microdeletion carriers, most do not receive a diagnosis of ASD. 16p11.2 deletion carriers are phenotypically diverse (and overlap with the nonclinical population), and they are at risk for several other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as obesity.8 Family members should always be offered genetic counseling and testing to assess whether they are carriers and to assess the recurrence risk of ASD in any siblings.The finding of a rare genomic variant in this patient could eventually open the door to a precision medicine treatment approach based on studies of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. As an illustration, mouse models of 16p11.2 deletion suggest that the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor agonist R-baclofen may improve behavior.6,9 R-baclofen affects inhibition by gamma-aminobutyric acid, which is postulated to contribute to the pathophysiology of ASD via excessive excitatory or insufficient inhibitory neurotransmission. A randomized clinical trial of R-baclofen in the general ASD population did not show improvement in irritability and agitation symptoms, although suggestive results on 2 other measures may merit a follow-up study.10",Psychiatry,"A 4-year-old boy was referred to the child psychiatry clinic for management of tantrums with aggression and self-injurious behavior.

Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst,D,Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst,"The differential diagnosis for acute urinary retention, lower extremity hyperreflexia, and intermittent sensory or motor deficits dependent on activity and position includes spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, anterior thoracolumbar spinal cord herniation, and symptomatic thoracic arachnoid cysts. Our initial concern that it was a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula led us to perform magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine using FIESTA sequences in hopes of visualizing dilated serpentine spinal veins that may be seen in this entity. The findings were not consistent with a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula but rather demonstrated a flattened spinal cord with edema at the T7-T8 vertebral level (Figure), which is thought to be most compatible with anterior spinal cord herniation or a symptomatic arachnoid cyst. A subsequent computed tomographic myelogram confirmed the presence of a 14.0 × 8.4-mm posterior extradural arachnoid cyst obstructing the free flow of the contrast agent and causing intermittent deformity of the spinal cord at the T7 level with cerebrospinal fluid pulsation (Video).Spinal arachnoid cysts are uncommon protrusions of the spinal cord that rarely cause symptomatic compression of the cord. Although their pathogenesis is poorly understood, they are thought to arise from congenital deformities or dural trauma.1-3 Although magnetic resonance imaging is useful for identifying a soft tissue mass, computed tomographic myelography is the diagnostic study of choice for spinal dural arachnoid cysts because it can reveal a cyst’s access to the subarachnoid space.2,4-6 Furthermore, the dynamic nature of computed tomographic myelography enables real-time visualization of cerebrospinal fluid pulsations accounting for intermittent cord compression by the cyst and the resultant episodic symptoms. The origin of these pulsations has been suggested to be primarily related to the cardia, arising from intracranial pulsations in the cerebrovascular bed and choroid plexus, along with local pulsations in the spinovascular beds.7,8 Respiration has also been shown to variably influence the magnitude and duration of cerebrospinal fluid pulsations.9The definitive treatment of spinal arachnoid cysts is complete surgical excision of the cyst with repair of the communicating dural defect.2 The prognosis is favorable, often with complete resolution of neurological symptoms following operative resection. Those presenting with a shorter duration of symptoms tend to have better outcomes than those with a more prolonged duration.10 Urinary retention may be reversible or irreversible depending on the duration and extent of cord compression.The patient underwent T7-T8 laminectomy with resection of the cyst and experienced immediate resolution of sensory symptoms.

He complained about abdominal pain and had vomited twice. At physical examination, according to the Advanced Pediatric Life Support protocol, he had normal vitals results with pain during palpation of the left abdominal region without guarding. His hemoglobin level was 12.3 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) (normal value, 10.5-16.1 g/dL), amylase 68 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167) (normal value, <85 U/L), and lipase 25 U/L (normal value, <60 U/L). A plain chest radiography result showed no signs of traumatic injury. Abdominal ultrasonography results showed a bowel loop with a thickened wall in the left abdominal region with no free abdominal fluid. He was admitted to the pediatric ward for close observation. The next day, his vomiting persisted, especially after oral intake.

Intramural small-bowel hematoma,C,Intramural small bowel hematoma,"The computed tomography scan showed an intramural small-bowel hematoma with a complete bowel obstruction and no signs of perforation. Because of his persistent vomiting, the patient initially received a nasogastric tube. All oral intake immediately resulted in nausea that was relieved by nasogastric tube drainage. Because of the persistent vomiting, the patient underwent a laparotomy 2 days posttrauma, at which the diagnosis of a traumatic intramural jejunal hematoma with complete luminal obstruction was confirmed. The injured jejunal segment was resected, followed by an end-to-end anastomosis (Figure 2). The postoperative course was uncomplicated and his oral intake could be reinstated 2 days postsurgery.An isolated intramural hematoma of the small bowel is a relatively rare complication of blunt abdominal trauma in children. Clinical symptoms can range from vague and nonspecific to those fitting a complete bowel obstruction. It requires a high index of suspicion in all patients with blunt abdominal trauma, particularly because associated bowel injuries (eg, perforation) require urgent surgical treatment. In most cases, a computed tomography scan is needed for diagnosis, localization, and to estimate the severity of the obstruction. Also, computed tomography can be helpful in ruling out bowel perforations.1 Literature on the management of traumatic small-bowel hematoma is limited to case reports and small case series.2 Management can be either nonoperative or surgical, depending on the severity of obstruction, associated injuries, and complications, such as small-bowel perforation.3,4 Successful percutaneous drainage of duodenal hematomas has also been described, but evidence for this approach is scarce.5 With the duodenum largely fixed in the retroperitoneum and surgically more difficult to approach, percutaneous drainage might be a feasible strategy. In our view, percutaneous drainage of an intramural hematoma of the jejunum or ileum seems unattractive because of the risk of iatrogenic perforation and drain luxation. In this case, we chose a surgical approach because of the complete small-bowel obstruction with the outlook of long-term total parenteral feeding and the risk of secondary perforation.The patient had a complete recovery after 3-week follow-up at our outpatient clinic.",Surgery,"A healthy 6-year-old boy presented to the emergency department after experiencing a bicycle handlebar injury.

Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor,D,Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor,"Although pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors (PFTs) are rare, they are an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of spindle cell tumors. Since first reported in the lung in 1954,1 PFTs have been reported in various organs2 and described by other names, including pseudosarcoma, inflammatory pseudotumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferation, and postoperative spindle cell nodule. Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors are thought to occur via a benign fibroproliferative process and to develop atypical spindle cell features that are often associated with a recent history of surgical procedures. Typically, few mitoses are seen, and there is often a clear inflammatory component.3 However, PFTs are frequently misinterpreted as sarcomas. Sections of our patient’s tumor demonstrated spindle cell proliferation with bundles of relatively bland, tapered cells arranged in a swirling pattern. These cells were intermixed with smooth muscle bundles and overlying urothelial mucosa, consistent with bladder wall infiltration. Mitoses were rare, and there was a focal infiltrate of inflammatory cells. Trichrome stain revealed diffuse collagenous fibrosis. Immunohistochemical stains were useful in differentiating PFTs from other entities.The results of immunohistochemical stains were positive for smooth muscle actin, patchy positive for desmin, and focally positive for pan-keratin. There were scattered S100-positive cells. The differential diagnosis included leiomyosarcoma, given the smooth muscle actin and desmin positivity. However, leiomyosarcomas typically do not stain with keratin. A diagnosis of sarcoma or sarcomatoid carcinoma was considered, but the proliferative index was minimal (MIB1 [OMIM 608677] <1%) and the cytologic features were bland. CD34 negativity helped exclude vascular tumors. The S100 staining suggested the possibility of a liposarcoma, but our patient’s negative MDM2 and CDK4 immunostain results made this diagnosis less likely.4 Finally, KIT (OMIM 164920) negativity helped exclude a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.The finding that scattered cells were positive for S100 also suggested a neural tumor type, such as a neurofibroma, an intriguing possibility given the patient’s family history. However, neurofibromas in the bladder are rare, with only 60 reported cases.5 Neurofibromas are characterized by loosely arranged hypocellular fascicles with scattered spindle cells and collagen bundles.Our patient’s condition did not demonstrate these findings. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can occur spontaneously or in the setting of neurofibromatosis 1. These are rare tumors (incidence of 1 in 1 000 000 population) and typically have poor prognoses. An atypical neurofibroma can often mimic a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, but the latter is a true malignant tumor with variably increased cellularity, pleomorphism, mitotic figures, and aggressive phenotype.Having used combined clinical, radiographic, pathologic, and immunohistochemical findings to rule out other tumor types in the differential diagnosis, a final diagnosis of PFT was made. Although the term pseudosarcoma would suggest a benign biological process, these tumors can recur locally and metastasize hematogenously. On searching PubMed (with the keywords inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor), we identified 48 publications in which 31 of 409 patients (7.6%) developed metastatic disease. In one report, the rate of local recurrence and metastatic disease were as high as 55.9% and 10.9%, respectively.6 Given these risks, surgical resection with negative margins is the mainstay of treatment for these tumors. In scenarios in which the disease is considered unresectable or when the patient’s comorbidities prohibit an operation, nonsurgical options may be considered. Because nearly 50% of them possess TPM3-ALK (OMIM 191030 and 105590) rearrangements that induce malignant transformation, these tumors may respond to ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib.7 This treatment may be used for converting unresectable to potentially resectable disease.Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors are rare lesions that surgeons must consider within the appropriate clinical context. Although most PFTs are considered benign, these tumors have the potential to behave in a malignant fashion. Surgical therapy remains the criterion standard for treatment of this disease. After resection of his PFT, our patient has had no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastases.",Surgery,"A 66-year-old man was doing well 6 months after robotic radical prostatectomy for prostatic carcinoma and synchronous left radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma.

Iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis,C,Iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis,"Since the performance of the first successful pancreas transplant by Kelly and colleagues1 in 1966, the field has witnessed over the last 2 decades a steady increase in the number of pancreas transplants performed. With successive advances in organ preservation, immunosuppression, and operative techniques, combined kidney-pancreas transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with chronic kidney disease and insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus. Nearly 1000 pancreas transplants are performed in the United States annually, and with improving long-term graft functional success rates positively impacting patient survival,2 more and more adult, previously diabetic patients are alive with functioning pancreas transplants.3 Thus, it is important that all health care providers be familiar with the basic anatomy of a pancreas transplant, which receives arterial blood supply from the recipient iliac artery most commonly via a donor iliac Y graft and whose venous outflow can either be constructed via a donor portal vein anastomosis to the systemic venous system (via the iliac vein or inferior vena cava) or to the portal venous system (via the superior mesenteric vein). Pseudoaneurysms of the pancreas transplant arterial anastomoses have been reported and may be due to an error in anastomotic surgical technique, intra-abdominal infections, or injury during percutaneous pancreas transplant biopsies.4 Increasingly, endovascular prostheses are being used to treat arterial disease owing to a growing list of indications ever since the description of their first use by Sigwart et al5 in 1987. As atherosclerotic arteries are commonly encountered in diabetic patients, it would not be unexpected that interventional radiologists and cardiologists may see patients with prior pancreas transplants. The interventionist who performed the stent grafting in our patient was unaware of the fact that the feeding artery to the pancreas transplant was involved. We believe the best course of action would have been an open surgical repair and bypass, which is well described in the literature.4In the case of our patient, a diagnosis of pancreas transplant thrombosis due to occlusion of the inflow artery to the pancreas transplant was entertained and the patient was urgently transferred to our facility. Interestingly, the patient’s serum amylase and lipase levels were within normal range and his blood glucose was only mildly elevated (highest of 131 mg/dL). The patient underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy and intraoperative findings were consistent with thrombosis of the inflow artery. A transplant pancreatectomy was performed and pathology confirmed diffuse parenchymal necrosis.

Lupus enteritis,C,Lupus enteritis,"The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. A rheumatology consultation was obtained, and she was given intravenous methyprednisolone, 1000 mg daily, for 4 days. The patient’s abdominal pain improved within 8 hours of methyprednisolone administration, and by hospital day 2, she was tolerating a diet of solid food.Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune-mediated chronic inflammatory disease with the potential to affect every organ system.1 Systemic lupus erythematosus affects the hematologic, renal, and central nervous systems most commonly, and presentations can be variable.1 Enteritis is a relatively rare sequela of systemic lupus erythematosus, typically presenting with signs and symptoms similar to those of mesenteric ischemia, with pain out of proportion to the findings on physical examination.2 In some studies, lupus enteritis is referred to as the most frequent possible cause of abdominal pain in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus2; alternatively, in other studies, lupus enteritis is cited as a relatively rare cause of abdominal pains, illustrating our lack of knowledge about this disease secondary to its relative rarity.3 Laboratory test findings are nonspecific and usually positive only for inflammatory markers.4 Computed tomography scans demonstrate severe bowel wall thickening (ie, target sign). Mesenteric fat stranding and engorged mesenteric vessels are also commonly observed.5 Bladder wall thickening is frequently found on CT scans. The patient also presented with a moderate degree of ascites.Given the grave findings on CT scans, lupus enteritis can appear on cursory glance to resemble mesenteric ischemia but is lacking the large vessel thrombosis and/or occlusion seen in that disease.5 Prompt recognition of lupus enteritis is key to preventing the sequelae of perforation, obstruction, or necrosis.Management of lupus enteritis consists of prompt administration of immunologic suppression, usually consisting of pulse doses of corticosteroids.4 Several practitioners have reported positive outcomes using alternative methods of immunosuppression such as cyclophosphamide. These are considered second-line therapies in cases in which corticosteroids have failed or are contraindicated.4,6 Patients usually respond well to immunosuppression, as was seen in our case, with complete resolution of abdominal pain within hours.Vigilant surgical attention is warranted for early recognition of clinical deterioration. Despite the relative paucity of literature on lupus enteritis, the pendulum has shifted from early surgical intervention toward medical management in the absence of absolute indications for surgical intervention such as bowel necrosis or perforation.There have been reports of the recurrence of lupus enteritis being associated with the degree of initial bowel wall thickening or the involvement of the urinary tract.7,8 Lymphopenia, elevated amylase, and hypoalbuminemia are reported to be associated with poorer outcomes.9In conclusion, lupus enteritis, while relatively rare, is an important diagnosis to consider for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus presenting with severe abdominal pain. Given the profound findings on CT scans, it is often the consultant surgeon determining the treatment for these patients. With appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, potentially morbid diagnostic operations can be avoided.9",Surgery,"A patient in them 50s with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, congestive heart failure, and type 2 diabetes presented to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain 1 day after discharge from an admission for similar abdominal pain.

Repair proceeded through an open incision, as is our preference for a presumed flank hernia, particularly one containing multiple abdominal organs. We encountered pleura with a sac herniating posterior to the sternum, leading to the diagnosis of combined Morgagni and chest wall hernias. Consultation with our thoracic colleagues prompted sac inversion and diaphragm plication with nonabsorbable monofilament suture in a figure-of-8 fashion without entering the abdomen. Bioprosthetic mesh reinforced the intrapleural space between the ninth and 10th ribs, followed by polypropylene mesh onlay extending 8 to 10 cm beyond the fascial closure in all directions and binding with fibrin sealant (Figure 2B). Drains were placed between the bioprosthetic and hernia closure and subcutaneously, then vacuum dressing. She was discharged on postoperative day 12. At follow-up 2, 5, and 6 weeks later, she reported gradual to full function. Her incision healed well and the final drain was removed at week 6. At 6 weeks, she had a small right pleural effusion but no recurrence.A, Preoperative computed tomographic scan. B, Mesh placement.Giovanni Battista Morgagni described a diaphragm laceration “independent of any wounding instrument… from the ensiform cartilage and the neighbouring fibres. …the stomach was found in the right cavity, and the freedom from lungs indicated that this was an instance of malformation” in The Seats and Causes of Diseases,1 published in 1769 and translated by Cooke in 1824. Other translations suggest Morgagni transcribed a conversation about his eponymous diaphragmatic defect related by a Roman surgeon.2Congenital diaphragmatic hernias affect 1 in 3000 live births and demonstrate a postnatal survival rate of 50% to 75%.3 Defective rhabdomyoblast migration is the causative factor.4 Primary hepatic herniation, followed by the liver’s return to the abdominal cavity and ingress into the sac of more freely mobile abdominal contents or insufficient posthepatic mesenchymal plate development are hypothesized to cause congenital diaphragmatic hernias.5,6 Horton et al7 reviewed 295 patients and found most defects (91%) were right-sided; the balance were either left-sided (5%) or bilateral (4%).Clinical presentation varies. Vague abdominal symptoms were reported in some series, whereas others cited pulmonary and pain or pressure symptoms.4,7 Obstruction, dysphagia, bleeding, and gastroesophageal reflux disease may also be present. Horton et al7 found 72% of patients had symptoms. Physical examination is nonspecific. Chest radiography is ordered in 93% of cases, followed by CT scan in 47%.7 Reported CT scan sensitivity and specificity were 78% and 100% for left-sided defects vs 50% and 100% for right-sided defects, respectively.8 Horton et al7 noted that 40 of 195 published cases reported changing diagnosis during surgery.Isolated Morgagni hernias are amenable to multiple approaches, with successes published in all 8 permutations. Surgeons chose thoracotomy in 49% of the published cases. This is potentially problematic given the 9% reported rate of left-sided hernias combined with a 78% sensitivity of CT scan for left-sided defects. Surgeons have reported laparoscopic and thoracoscopic approaches.7,9 Mesh placement occurred in 7% of the open cases vs 64% of endoscopic cases.7 Garriboli et al10 tracked 22 children, finding recurrences in 2 treated thoracoscopically; 1 received mesh. Laparoscopic primary closure resulted in recurrence in 5 of 11 children in another series; reintervention with mesh placement in 2 resolved the reherniation.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Acute appendicitis,Colonic ischemia,Diverticulitis with perforation,Infectious colitis,B. Colonic ischemia,B,Colonic ischemia,"Computed tomography revealed cecal wall hypoenhancement with pneumatosis, sparing of the remaining colon and appendix, and bilateral renal infarcts. Given the patient’s abdominal pain, imaging findings, and history of early-onset stroke and cardiovascular disease, she was diagnosed with isolated cecal ischemia, an extremely rare presentation of acute colonic ischemia.Although the exact cause remains unclear, most cases are of nonocclusive origin,1,2 a variant of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, in which a low-flow state results in splanchnic vasoconstriction as blood flow is preferentially diverted to essential organs. It is associated with critical illness and cardiovascular disease. Occlusive causes are rarer and predominantly attributable to large arterial atherosclerotic disease with distal thromboembolism (spontaneous or after vascular procedures), cardiac arrhythmias with embolism of atrial thrombus, small arterial disease in patients with diabetes, or venous outflow obstruction from hypercoagulable states.3 Resultant segmental ischemia often occurs at watershed areas. The cecum may also represent a watershed area4 owing to its end arterial supply from the anterior and posterior cecal arteries. In most patients, there is dual arterial inflow from a vascular arcade that bridges the ileal and colic branches of the ileocolic artery5; however, the rare anatomical variant of a singular inflow off the colic branch may predispose these patients to ischemia.6 The appendix, terminal ileum, and ascending colon have multiple arterial sources, which may explain why these are at lesser risk of ischemia.Isolated cecal ischemia most commonly manifests as acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, leukocytosis, and nonspecific imaging findings of cecal wall thickening with adjacent fat stranding. It is frequently misdiagnosed as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or infectious colitis.7 A high index of suspicion is warranted, especially in elderly patients, those who are critically ill, or patients with atrial dysrhythmias or atherosclerotic disease. In addition, prompt imaging with intravenous contrast enhancement is important to evaluate for colonic ischemia. Caution is advised with colonoscopy because of the risk of perforation of a thin-walled ischemic cecum from increased intraluminal pressure.8 Mortality rates are high, and timely diagnosis is key to prevent rapid patient death.After the diagnosis is established, prompt surgical resection of the ischemic segment is crucial, although the role of primary anastomosis vs end ileostomy remains in debate.9,10 Schuler and Hudlin10 described 5 patients with isolated cecal necrosis: 4 had mucosal necrosis and underwent primary anastomosis, and 1 had transmural necrosis with perforation and underwent end ileostomy. Only the patients undergoing primary anastomosis survived. Çakar et al2 described 6 patients with transmural necrosis; half underwent primary anastomosis and the other half end ileostomy. Five patients underwent a second-look operation within 48 hours; all patients who had an initial anastomosis had evidence of staple-line ischemia and required another resection with end ileostomy. We advocate for end ileostomy in transmural necrosis; however, primary anastomosis may be considered if necrosis is limited to the mucosa when close examination of the patient is performed postoperatively.After initiation of fluid resuscitation, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and a heparin drip, the patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy. A 10 × 10–cm area of full-thickness cecal necrosis was identified with a normal appendix, terminal ileum, and ascending colon. An ileocecectomy was performed. Her renal function normalized postoperatively. The results of laboratory studies and findings of transesophageal echography were negative for a hypercoagulable cause or embolic source. Despite transition to dual antiplatelet therapy, 4 weeks postoperatively, the patient developed recurrent abdominal pain and melena with midtransverse colonic ischemia seen on imaging.

Brachial artery pseudoaneurysm,D,Brachial artery pseudoaneurysm,"Computed tomography angiography of the right upper extremity confirmed pseudoaneurysm measuring 3.8 cm, originating from the profunda brachii artery (Figure 2). The patient underwent open surgical repair. To gain proximal control, an incision was made in the right axilla and the proximal brachial artery was controlled with a silastic loop. A separate incision was then made over the pseudoaneurysm. The hematoma was evacuated and the pseudoaneurysm sac was excised. A small opening in the profunda brachii artery was sutured with horizontal mattress of 7-0 cardiovascular polypropylene (Ethicon). Postoperatively, the swelling and motor function in the right upper extremity improved with a palpable radial pulse.Extensive deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity results in disproportional swelling of the hand and forearm compared with the upper arm. Duplex imaging ruled out deep venous thrombosis. The patient did not receive an intravenous infusion in the right arm since the PICC was not present. Secondary lymphedema is usually chronic and is often related to mastectomy with axillary node dissection and/or radiotherapy. Iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm of the upper extremity is an uncommon clinical entity caused by focal weakness within the arterial wall from arterial injury. Iatrogenic instrumentation, infection, or repetitive trauma are the most commonly described causes. Brachial and radial access are being increasingly used for cardiac and vascular interventions and carries a small risk of pseudoaneurysm formation.1 Intravenous substance abuse is a more frequent cause of infected pseudoaneurysms in the antecubital fossa. Patients with upper extremity pseudoaneurysms often present with a painful mass, swelling, or paresthesias due to local nerve compression.2 Alternatively, a patient may present with distal ischemia due to a thromboembolic event. Diagnosis often can be suspected on physical examination; however, duplex ultrasonography is the diagnostic study of choice. Computed tomographic arteriography may aid in operative planning.Pseudoaneurysms can be treated using surgical and percutaneous interventions. Percutaneous ultrasonography–guided thrombin injection used frequently for iatrogenic femoral artery pseudoaneurysms is less frequently utilized in the treatment of upper extremity pseudoaneurysms.3 In cases of pseudoaneurysm arising from a small branch, coil embolization can be performed.4 More proximal pseudoaneurysms in the axillary and subclavian arteries can be successfully managed with stent graft placement.5 This patient had an associated large hematoma causing limitation of motor function.

Free-floating arterial thrombus,B,Free-floating arterial thrombus,"Preoperative imaging revealed a severe (>70%) left ICA stenosis with a portion of free-floating thrombus (FFT) distally. We placed the patient on a heparin infusion. Owing to the high risk of recurrent stroke and contralateral ICA occlusion, we felt surgical intervention was indicated. The high bifurcation, distal FFT up to the second cervical vertebral level, potential for jaw subluxation, short neck and body habitus, and need for intraoperative shunt (contralateral ICA occlusion) made carotid endarterectomy anatomically a high-risk option. After extensive discussion with the patient, we proceeded with a left carotid stent with cerebrovascular protection. We traversed the stenosis and thrombus with a 0.014-inch filter wire with no resistance (SpiderFX) and placed a 6 × 8 × 30-mm nitinol stent (Figure 2). The patient’s neurological status was confirmed at each step. Biplanar imaging was used to obtain prestenting and poststenting carotid and cerebral angiograms to rule out any distal embolization. The patient was discharged home the following day. She is symptom free with a patent stent at 6-week follow-up.Angiogram of the left internal carotid artery following stent placement.Free-floating thrombus is an uncommon entity with an incidence rate of 0.05% to 0.7% in symptomatic patients.1 The most commonly used definition is an elongated thrombus attached to the arterial wall with circumferential blood flow at its distal-most aspect and cyclical motion with cardiac cycles.2 The cause of FFT is usually atherosclerotic plaque (75% of cases), but 47% of patients have hypercoagulable states.2 Diagnosis is made via conventional angiography, computed tomographic angiography, or duplex ultrasonography.2-4 Lesions extending more than 3.8 mm craniocaudally are more likely to represent FFT than ulcerated plaque.5Treatment can consist of anticoagulation only, as shown by multiple case reports.2,3,6 However, surgical intervention is indicated in patients with underlying significant stenosis, recurrent symptoms, inability to undergo anticoagulation, or thrombus progression. Common risks to all interventions include distal embolization and potential thrombosis. Carotid endarterectomy has been the standard surgical therapy, with good reported results.1,3 Techniques for FFT treatment include distal isolation of the ICA without touching the bulb and thrombus retrieval through back-bleeding control and removal of residual thrombus manually or with a Fogarty catheter.4 Positive results have also been described with endovascular techniques, including carotid stenting, suction removal of the thrombus, and coiling of the affected artery.6,7 For carotid stenting, we used perioperative anticoagulation, low-profile devices, minimal bulb manipulation before deployment of the filter, and gentle postballoon dilation as strategies to avoid those risks. Neurointerventional help was available in the event of distal embolization. Flow reversal technique can also be used in these situations and has the theoretical advantage of not crossing the lesion prior to establishing distal protection. However, there is a possibility of transient ischemic attack/stroke or intolerance to flow reversal with contralateral ICA occlusion.8",Surgery,"A patient in them early 60s with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia was transferred to our hospital after multiple transient ischemic attacks and left internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis during the past several months.

Internal hernia of the cecum,B,Internal hernia of the cecum,"The foramen of Winslow, also known as the epiploic foramen, is bordered by the duodenum, caudate lobe of the liver, and vena cava. The foramen of Winslow is an anatomical communication between the great and lesser peritoneal cavities. Internal hernias through the foramen of Winslow account for 8% of all internal hernias, 30% of which contain the cecum, ascending colon, or terminal ileum.1Cecal herniation through the foraman of Winslow requires a hypermobile cecum, an enlarged foramen, and elongated small-bowel mesentery.1 Patients with a hypermobile cecum may develop other complications, such as cecal volvulus, which is a more common cause of the cecum being in the left upper quadrant. Abdominopelvic computed tomography permits preoperative diagnosis of internal hernia through the foramen of Winslow by demonstrating mesenteric fat and vessels posterior to the portal structures and gas and fluid collection in the lesser sac tapering toward the area of the foramen.2Herniation through the foramen of Winslow is the rarest cause of internal hernias. As a result, current literature consists only of case reports,1-9 with a consensus that all patients with an internal hernia through the foramen of Winslow require timely surgical intervention to prevent potential complications (eg, bowel obstruction or ischemia).10 Surgical techniques, however, vary depending on patient conditions and surgeon preferences.6,7,10This patient underwent an urgent exploratory laparotomy during which the preoperative diagnosis of internal hernia of the cecum through the foramen of Winslow was confirmed. Because the cecum was massively dilated, reduction through the foramen of Winslow was initially not possible. The cecum was first exposed by incising the anterior leaflet of the gastrocolic ligament and then decompressed with an angiocatheter (Figure 2). The hernia contents, including the cecum, appendix, and a portion of the terminal ileum, were then reduced into the greater peritoneum via the foramen of Winslow. The opening of the foramen was closed by approximating the serosal covering of the gallbladder to the retroperitoneum to prevent reherniation. The cecum was inspected and preserved because it did not have any signs of ischemia or serosal tear. An appendectomy was then performed, followed by a cecopexy. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 5 after an unremarkable recovery.Intraoperative image of a distended cecum exposed by incising the anterior leaflet of the gastrocolic ligament.",Surgery,"A man in him 60s presented with acute-onset, diffuse abdominal pain for 24 hours accompanied by nausea and retching.

The lesion progressively developed several days after an unintentional exposure to blood with a blade used to drain an abscess of the oral cavity. The patient presented a deep wound induced by the bistoury piercing of the index finger pulp of the right hand, with a disrupted epidermal barrier. Both the patient who was operated on and the surgeon were negative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B/C virus testing. A soft tissue abscess of the digit appeared 7 days after the initial trauma. Antibiotic therapy combining amoxicillin and clavulanate was started, without any significant improvement. Surgery was performed urgently, with excision of the wound entrance and washing of the flexor tendon sheath. Bacteriological swabs were performed in the same time. An antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate was prescribed. Forty-eight hours after surgery, pustules appeared. Further drainage and washing of the sheath were repeated (Figure, A). The bacteriological samples were found to be sterile. The surgeon was hospitalized for infusions combining piperacillin/tazobactam and teicoplanine, carried out over 72 hours. An oral antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate (3 g every 24 hours) was prescribed for 10 additional days. The lesions completely resolved within 2 weeks. One year later, the surgeon presented with prodromal burning pain of the same index finger, and a similar soft tissue abscess recurred after 48 hours at the same site of the original lesion with a small painful vesicle progressively developed (Figure, B).A, Clinical aspect of the index finger 2 days after the second surgery.

A recurrent herpetic whitlow,C,A recurrent herpetic whitlow,"Further investigations were conducted at the time of the second episode of whitlow, occurring in the same location. Radiography did not reveal any sign suggestive of osteitis, while focused ultrasonography did not individualize any foreign body or damage to the flexor sheath. The vesicle fluid was positive for herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1) by in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction, leading to the diagnosis of a recurrent HSV-1 herpetic whitlow.Owing to a lack of knowledge of this viral infection, herpetic whitlow is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as a bacterial infection. The estimated incidence of herpetic whitlow is about 2.5 per 100 000 patients per year, which is probably mistaken.1 It mainly affects children younger than 10 years (HSV-1) or young adults (HSV-1 or HSV-2).2-4 Health care workers are at higher risk of contamination, especially when they are in contact with the oral cavity or secretions from the nasopharynx and mouth, ie, dentists, anesthesiologists, and medical staff working in intensive care units.5The literature reports several cases of complications resulting from misdiagnosed herpetic whitlows treated with surgery, ie, incision and drainage that may lead to secondary bacterial infection.2,6,7 Systemic and/or local complications, such as herpetic keratitis, hypoesthesia or hyperesthesia, and nail loss, are described. Misdiagnosis leading to unnecessary surgery and potential increasing morbidity highlights the importance of diagnosing a herpetic whitlow without wasting time in medical workers. Some characteristic clinical signs may be helpful: (1) occurrence after trauma in the skin defect area, usually in the dominant hand; (2) prodromal pain that appears between 2 and 20 days after inoculation; (3) occasional presence of fever and systemic symptoms; and (4) typical appearance  of a large vesicle with serous fluid surrounded by erythema; grouped or scattered vesicles can be also observed. The diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction or viral cultures.After resolution of the initial infection, the virus can be reactivated spontaneously or triggered by an appropriate stimulus, eg, a general illness, stress, ultraviolet light exposure, menstruation, or tissue damage. About 20% to 50% of patients experience a recurrence that remains usually milder than the primary infection.1 Herpetic whitlow requires an appropriate treatment with oral antiviral medication. Acyclovir or valacyclovir may be beneficial in this context to prevent recurrence and reduce duration of symptoms.8 The other aim of treatment is to prevent autoinoculation and transmission of the infection, with local protection with wound dressing.9This case emphasized that herpetic whitlow may occur in any health care worker who has regular contact with contaminated oral secretion. Recurrence is the rule, and it may represent an occupational disease. For surgeons, there remains the question of the right to operate in initial infection and recurrence and patient information. No recommendation exists in Europe.In 2004, the Department of Health of Western Australia published Guidelines for Health Care Workers with Herpes Lesions (http://www.health.wa.gov.au/circularsnew/pdfs/7417.pdf): (1) any health care worker with direct patient contact and who has a suspected HSV lesion of the hands should report to the designated Staff Health Officer; (2) a HSV lesion should be considered infectious until the lesion has become crusty and dry; and (3) the risk of transmission from an active herpetic whitlow to a patient, especially a newborn, is higher. There should be no direct patient contact until the lesions have healed.In conclusion, this case highlighted that herpetic whitlow may affect health care workers. Moreover, it is often misdiagnosed as bacterial infection. Knowledge of clinical symptoms would avoid inappropriate surgical treatment, especially in recurrent lesions. No direct patient contact until lesions have healed could be recommended for surgeons.",Surgery,"A 35-year-old white head and neck surgeon with an unremarkable medical history was referred to the Surgical Emergency Department for a phlegmon of the flexor tendon sheath of the right hand.

Hepatic abscess,C,Hepatic abscess,"In this case of group C streptococci–related liver abscess following pharyngitis and scarlet fever, the radiological features were not typical of a simple cyst or of a biliary cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma, given the multiloculated aspect and the absence of contrast enhancement in the septa. The probability of a diagnosis of hydatid cyst was low owing to the patient’s history and the absence of calcifications. Therefore, being suspicious of an infectious etiology, we decided to perform an ultrasonography-guided diagnostic puncture of the hepatic lesion, which yielded a purulent fluid. A percutaneous drain was positioned. A fluid sample was sent to the laboratory for both microbiological and cytological examinations and evidenced necrotic debris in which β-hemolytic group C Streptococcus was isolated. Levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) was administered based on the antibiogram, which also showed that the strain of Streptococcus was resistant to clarithromycin. No primary abdominal infectious foci were apparent on the radiological images. A diagnostic workup was completed with a colonoscopy and an echocardiography, the results of which were negative. Positron emission computed tomography revealed, in addition to an intense enhancement in the liver abscess, a hypermetabolic lymph node located in the anterior mandibular region, ostensibly an issue of the previous pharyngitis. The patient’s course was favorable, and he was discharged from the hospital on day 14, after the removal of the percutaneous drain.Liver abscess is a rare condition with an incidence of 13 to 20 cases per 100 000 population per year.1 Abscesses are more often of a biliary or portal origin. Arterial bacteremia, traumatic injury, and the spread of the abscess by contiguity are more unusual causes. Ten percent to 30% of abscesses are idiopathic. A fever and upper right abdominal pain are the most common symptoms. Jaundice is observed in 25% to 30% of the patients. Aerobic gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria are the most common types of bacteria isolated, accounting for 40% to 60% cases and 40% to 50% of cases, respectively.2 Aerobic gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, α- and β-hemolytic streptococci, and group D streptococci) are isolated in 10% to 20% cases.3 The treatment consists of percutaneous drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, which is adapted according to the antibiogram of the isolates. Surgery is rarely indicated in the case of failure of the percutaneous drain.Scarlet fever is a common pediatric disease, and it is usually caused by pyrogenic toxin-producing group A streptococci. In most cases, it is consequent to an upper respiratory tract infection (“strep throat”). The prognosis is usually good after a timely diagnosis and proper antibiotic therapy, which is effective in reducing the incidence of scarlet fever’s most feared complications (ie, rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis).4 Other complications include osteomyelitis, arthritis, otitis media, hepatitis, meningitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis.5,6β-Hemolytic streptococci of a group other than A and B are known to cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including abscesses,7 more frequently in elderly and immunocompromised patients, but invasive infections are also observed in immunocompetent individuals.8 Occasionally, scarlet fever can be caused by β-hemolytic group C streptococci,9 whose resistance to macrolides in patients with an invasive infection has been previously described.10To the best of our knowledge, a liver abscess caused by group C streptococci following scarlet fever has never been reported. Even if the pharyngeal origin of the Streptococcus could not be formally demonstrated, the pathogenetic link between the previous pharyngitis and the liver abscess in our case is established by the fact that scarlet fever is an exotoxin-mediated disease arising from β-hemolytic streptococcal infection. In this instance, the abscess was most likely the consequence of a transient group C streptococcal bacteremia. Our young patient had no detectable immunodeficiency, which is noteworthy because it stresses that, even in immunocompetent individuals, this pathology should be considered. Finally, the case report once more highlights the paramount importance of obtaining liver abscess fluid cultures in order to search for ongoing or previous infectious foci and to administer the appropriate antibiotics.",Surgery,"A 26-year-old man was admitted to our institution for a fever (temperature, 39°C) and abdominal pain on the right side of his hypochondrium.

The mass in the lessor sac was the isolated lymph node metastasis without histological evidence of invasion to the pancreas. All resection margin findings were negative for exposure of cancer.Intraoperative photograph of exploratory laparotomy revealing 2 isolated tumors: the 15-cm primary tumor located at segment 3 of the liver invading into the distal stomach and the other 12-cm mass in the lessor sac adhered to the superior border of the pancreas.Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare entity of liver primary malignancy. In the United States, the incidence of FL-HCC is 0.02 per 100 000 per year and it is approximately 100 times less common than conventional non-FL HCC.1,2 Unlike non–FL-HCC, FL-HCC often affects younger patients without underlying chronic liver disease. In addition, FL-HCC constitutes one of the major liver primary tumors among pediatric and young adult patients.3 Patients with FL-HCC typically present with nonspecific abdominal pain/discomfort or may not present with any symptoms and the tumor(s) may be discovered incidentally during workup of an unrelated medical condition, as with our patient. The histological diagnosis can be made preoperatively by fine-needle aspiration or core needle biopsy.Although the current data regarding the natural history and inherited biology of FL-HCC are limited, aggressive surgical resection has been recommended even for patients with advanced disease given its favorable long-term outcome. Mavros et al3 reviewed 19 previously reported case series including 206 patients with FL-HCC and demonstrated good long-term outcomes of patients who underwent surgical resection, with 18.5 years of median overall survival. Notably, in a series of 41 patients with FL-HCC who underwent resection from the University of Pittsburgh, 37 patients (90%) had stage IVA or IVB disease and their 5-year overall survival rates were still 66%, and 50%, respectively.4 On the other hand, however, the recurrence of FL-HCC after complete resection is not uncommon. In another series, the recurrence-free survival was reported as only 18% at 5 years and the sites of recurrence included the liver, lymph nodes, peritoneum, and lung.2 In fact, most long-term survivors underwent repeat resection(s) of recurrent disease in these series.2,4There is no consensus for the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and the optimal regimens for FL-HCC owing to the paucity of this disease. Our patient competed gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy and the recurrence was discovered at 6 months from the initial resection.

Spontaneous rupture of the spleen,C,Spontaneous rupture of the spleen,"Spontaneous rupture of the spleen is a rare and serious complication seen in less than a half percent of patients with infectious mononucleosis. The etiology of this condition is considered to be the result of a sudden increase in portal venous pressure caused by a Valsalva maneuver, leading to vascular engorgement. Acute compression of the enlarged spleen by the diaphragm or abdominal wall then causes the thinned splenic capsule to rupture.1,2 Specific consideration is given to avoidance of activities that may precipitate splenic rupture in patients diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis. Although most physicians recommend all patients to refrain from athletic activities for 3 to 4 weeks after illness onset, flying is not often associated with splenic rupture and such association has not been described in the literature, to our knowledge.In our patient, the abdominal ultrasonography revealed an enlarged spleen with surrounding fluid in the splenorenal space and Morrison pouch. He was expeditiously taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. On entering the abdominal cavity, approximately 4 L of hemoperitoneum were encountered. All 4 abdominal quadrants were packed with surgical laparotomy towels. Rupture of the splenic capsule was noted. The splenophrenic ligaments and the splenocolonic ligaments were bluntly dissected. Using a blunt right angle clamp, the splenic vein and artery were dissected and suture ligated using two 2-0 silk sutures. Subsequently, the spleen was removed and sent for pathological review. No other intra-abdominal pathology was noted. The patient did not sustain any intraoperative complications and had an uncomplicated postoperative course. A review of the records from his prior hospitalization revealed serologic test results positive for Epstein-Barr virus with a viral load of 31 769.

Most patients in this series (85.3%) had surgery within 24 hours of the diagnosis of splenic rupture, with an associated mortality of 7.4%.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Cavernous lymphangioma,Nodular basal cell carcinoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,Nodular melanoma,D. Nodular melanoma,D,Nodular melanoma,"Cavernous lymphangiomas usually arise during infancy, with the most common sites being the neck and head. They appear as painless swellings that can be flesh-colored, blue, or red lesions and may ulcerate. They can be surgically removed but often regrow, creating a therapeutic challenge. However, angiogenesis has been reported to be inhibited successfully with sirolimus.1Nodular basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin cancer and often has rolled, pearly edges with a central ulceration, tends to grow slowly, and usually does not metastasize.2 On histological examination, there are nests of basaloid cells, with palisading strands of the cells at the periphery and haphazard arrangement of the central cells as well as a hyperchromatic nucleus with little cytoplasm.Squamous cell carcinomas usually occur on sun-exposed locations, may produce keratin resulting in a scaly or hornlike appearance, and may ulcerate and bleed.3 On histological examination, there are nests, sheets, and strands of atypical keratinocytes originating in the epidermis and infiltrating into the dermis. Immunohistochemistry shows keratin expression with a high molecular weight and epithelial membrane antigen.Melanomas represent only 4% of all dermatologic cancers but account for 80% of skin cancer–related deaths.4 Nodular malignant melanoma is common in fair-skinned persons and on sun-exposed areas of the body.5 Wide local excision is the treatment for primary melanoma, with resection margins based on lesion thickness (1-cm margins for melanomas less than 2 mm thick and 2-cm and 3-cm margins for lesions greater than 2 mm and 4 mm thick, respectively).6 Wide local excision has been shown to reduce recurrence rates, although there is no statistically significant effect on survival. Patients with Clark level 5 melanoma are associated with 5-year survival rates of 25% or less.7 Melanoma is almost 100% curable when diagnosed early but has poor survival when metastatic.8 Adjuvant interferon alfa has been approved since 1996 based on the results of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1684 trial9 of patients with stage IIB or III melanoma, which showed the benefit of high-dose interferon alfa on both relapse-free and overall survival.In this patient, histological examination showed atypical melanocytes within the epidermis and dermis. Immunohistological stains can show S-100, MART-1, and HMB-45 as well as other immunohistological markers. The patient underwent a wide local excision of the back mass and a left axillary lymph node dissection. Histological examination of the back mass revealed it was malignant nodular melanoma with vertical growth, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and Clark level 5 with invasion into the subcutaneous fat (Figure 2). Left axillary dissection revealed enlarged, matted lymph nodes. However, histopathological examination revealed only sinus histiocytosis without evidence of any malignancy. Malignant nodular melanoma with vertical growth, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and Clark level 5 with invasion into the subcutaneous fat was found on histological examination.The patient declined to undergo skin graft coverage for the lesion and allowed the wound to heal by secondary intention.

Thymolipoma,B,Thymolipoma,"Thymolipomas are underrecognized and often misdiagnosed benign neoplasms of the anterior mediastinum.1 These neoplasms are confused with mediastinal lipomatosis, thymoma, or myelolipoma.2 Thymolipomas often present as very large, anterior mediastinal masses and exert compression on the cardiac structures. They tend to hang down either side of the pericardium, molding to the mediastinal structures.3 However, due to the predominant fat density, thymolipomas are difficult to diagnose on plain film. Chest tomography is the investigative procedure of choice; the pathognomonic finding is the predominant fat attenuation mixed with nodular elements that represent thymic tissue. Thymolipomas are distinct from thymomas, which do not have fatty elements, and mediastinal lipomatosis, which does not have these nodular elements. Thymolipomas are never associated with elevated tumor markers, including β-human chorionic gonadotropin, α-fetoprotein, or lactate dehydrogenase, differentiating them from germ cell tumors. Thymolipomas tumors can be mistaken for myelolipomas, which are very rare. On gross morphologic examination, thymic nests in thymolipomas are salmon-colored and dispersed throughout the predominantly fatty tumor (Figure 2). Histologic analysis of thymolipomas shows mature fat and thymic tissue with lack of Hassall corpuscles and intervening areas of fibrosis. In contrast, myelolipomas reveal hallmark bone marrow elements on histologic examination.4 Thymolipomas have been proposed to develop due to regression of a hyperplastic thymus, lipoma formation within thymic tissue, or hamartoma formation in the thymus.5Gross analysis. Cut section reveals a predominantly fatty tumor with islands of salmon-colored nests representing thymic tissue (black asterisks).This patient presented with presyncope and dyspnea likely resulting from caval compression. Most patients remain asymptomatic until the tumor is large enough to exert a mass effect on adjacent structures. The most common presenting symptoms are dyspnea and chest pain. The incidence of myasthenia gravis associated with thymolipoma has been reported6,7 as between 2.8% and 50%. Thymolipomas have also been associated8 with other autoimmune disorders, including hypogammaglobulinemia, aplastic anemia, and Graves disease. Timely surgical excision of thymolipomas is the treatment of choice and results are excellent. Complete R0 resection has been well documented using minimally invasive thoracoscopic resection.9 Robot-assisted resection has been shown10 to result in less operative blood loss, decreased length of stay, and decreased postoperative complications with superior results compared with the standard transsternal approach.

An uncomplicated postoperative course followed, with complete resolution of symptoms. Pathologic examination revealed a dark-purple nodule, consistent with a cavernous hemangioma (Figure 2). The adjacent venous structure was described as a varicose vein. No findings were suggestive of a malignant tumor.Histopathologic image of the specimen. Dilated vessels lined by flattened endothelium are visualized (original magnification ×400).Cavernous hemangiomas are vascular malformations that represent the most common congenital lesion in humans and the most frequent benign tumor in children.1 They consist of a series of dilated, thin-walled capillaries with a single layer of endothelium and a thin adventitia.1 Hemangiomas may occur as a single mass or as part of a cluster of dilated vascular structures that have a mulberry appearance. Although hemangiomas are found throughout the body, the most common sites are the subcutaneous tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle. Approximately 65% are associated with structures of the head or neck, of which 86% are supratentorial and 24% infratentorial.1 Males and females are affected in equal parts. Hemangiomas may occur in a sporadic or familial fashion, related to mutations in CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3.2,3Despite being mostly asymptomatic, hemangiomas can be associated with a multitude of symptoms, ranging from headaches and seizures to severe focal neurologic deficits and hemorrhage.4On gross examination, cavernous hemangiomas appear as soft, purple, poorly defined, and discolored lesions that blanch on compression. Pathologic examination reveals thin-walled, dilated capillaries surrounded by a single layer of endothelium.1 Magnetic resonance imaging remains the diagnostic imaging of choice. Other imaging modalities, including radiography, computed tomography, and tagged red blood cell scans, are commonly used for additional characterization.1,5Treatment of cavernous hemangiomas is based on their location and symptoms and may include medical or surgical interventions. Asymptomatic lesions are observed and monitored with interval imaging studies. Sclerosing agents and corticosteroids have been used to shrink tumors and prevent scaring. Lesions that cause compressive symptoms, hemorrhage, seizures, or neurologic deficits require prompt intervention. Surgical planning must consider the risks and benefits of the procedure, especially for lesions deep in the central nervous system.

Iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis,C,Iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis,"Since the performance of the first successful pancreas transplant by Kelly and colleagues1 in 1966, the field has witnessed over the last 2 decades a steady increase in the number of pancreas transplants performed. With successive advances in organ preservation, immunosuppression, and operative techniques, combined kidney-pancreas transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with chronic kidney disease and insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus. Nearly 1000 pancreas transplants are performed in the United States annually, and with improving long-term graft functional success rates positively impacting patient survival,2 more and more adult, previously diabetic patients are alive with functioning pancreas transplants.3 Thus, it is important that all health care providers be familiar with the basic anatomy of a pancreas transplant, which receives arterial blood supply from the recipient iliac artery most commonly via a donor iliac Y graft and whose venous outflow can either be constructed via a donor portal vein anastomosis to the systemic venous system (via the iliac vein or inferior vena cava) or to the portal venous system (via the superior mesenteric vein). Pseudoaneurysms of the pancreas transplant arterial anastomoses have been reported and may be due to an error in anastomotic surgical technique, intra-abdominal infections, or injury during percutaneous pancreas transplant biopsies.4 Increasingly, endovascular prostheses are being used to treat arterial disease owing to a growing list of indications ever since the description of their first use by Sigwart et al5 in 1987. As atherosclerotic arteries are commonly encountered in diabetic patients, it would not be unexpected that interventional radiologists and cardiologists may see patients with prior pancreas transplants. The interventionist who performed the stent grafting in our patient was unaware of the fact that the feeding artery to the pancreas transplant was involved. We believe the best course of action would have been an open surgical repair and bypass, which is well described in the literature.4In the case of our patient, a diagnosis of pancreas transplant thrombosis due to occlusion of the inflow artery to the pancreas transplant was entertained and the patient was urgently transferred to our facility. Interestingly, the patient’s serum amylase and lipase levels were within normal range and his blood glucose was only mildly elevated (highest of 131 mg/dL). The patient underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy and intraoperative findings were consistent with thrombosis of the inflow artery.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2532223,"A 51-year-old man presented with a 2-day history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Ultrasonography of the abdomen’s right upper quadrant showed gallbladder wall thickening with gallstones in the neck of the gallbladder consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis. He subsequently underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The critical view of safety1 was obtained, and the gallbladder was removed from the fossa without difficulty. On extraction of the gallbladder through the umbilical incision, a large stone in the gallbladder could be palpated. After several attempts of extraction, the retrieval bag perforated and stones spilled into the abdomen. Not all the spilled stones could be retrieved. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was discharged to home on postoperative day 2. Two weeks after surgery, he was evaluated for persistent mild abdominal pain in clinic. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a 2.5-cm calcified mass with adjacent inflammatory changes in the left hemiabdomen that was most consistent with a lost gallstone (Figure 1A). He returned to the emergency department 1 month later with a 2-day history of progressive abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. He denied fever and chills.

Gallstone ileus,B,Gallstone ileus,"The second abdominal CT showed complete occlusion of the small bowel by an intraluminal gallstone that had migrated from its previously seen extraluminal position. The patient underwent an emergent exploratory laparotomy. Several adhesions and substantial inflammatory changes were noted in the left hemiabdomen. After lysis of the adhesions, we identified a fistulous tract in the distal jejunum just proximal to the area where the stone was impacted (Figure 2). A 3.5-cm gallstone was extracted from the resected small-bowel specimen. The patient’s obstructive symptoms resolved, and he was discharged home on postoperative day 7.Surgical specimen showing a fistulous tract with surrounding inflammatory changes in the small bowel (arrowhead).Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the criterion standard in managing acute cholecystitis. The gallbladder can be perforated in approximately 40% of cases, typically during dissection from the fossa or extraction of the specimen.2-4 In addition, gallbladder perforation is more common when acute cholecystitis is the indication for cholecystectomy. Spilled gallstones are harder to retrieve with laparoscopy than with open cholecystectomy. The incidence of unretrieved spilled gallstones is reported to be as high as 33%.2,3 Strategies recommended for the intraoperative management of spilled gallstones include steps to minimize further spillage, attempt stone retrieval, and perform copious irrigation and suction.5 Although having unretrieved gallstones during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not an absolute indication for conversion to laparotomy, adequate documentation regarding lost gallstones should be dictated in the operative report because complications can occur many years after surgery.6Lost gallstones can migrate throughout the intraperitoneal cavity. Complications secondary to lost gallstones have been identified in 0.5% to 12% of patients.4-7 Abdominal wall abscess is the most common complication followed by intra-abdominal abscess, various fistulae, and stone expectoration.5 Scattered cases of small-bowel obstruction following laparoscopic cholecystectomy have been reported.3,8 Although obstruction can be caused by postoperative adhesion or intra-abdominal abscess, the present case illustrates spontaneous stone erosion leading to intraluminal occlusion. Factors associated with increased risk for complication include pigmented stones, acute cholecystitis with infected bile, spillage of more than 15 stones, gallstones larger than 1.5 cm, and older patient age.4 If late complications from lost gallstones are suspected, abdominal ultrasonography and CT are recommended. Surgical intervention—either laparoscopic or open—is preferred over radiologic intervention because surgery allows for drainage of the abscess and removal of the lost stones, thus minimizing recurrent complications.",Surgery,"A 51-year-old woman presented with a 2-day history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Ultrasonography of the abdomen’s right upper quadrant showed gallbladder wall thickening with gallstones in the neck of the gallbladder consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis. She subsequently underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The critical view of safety1 was obtained, and the gallbladder was removed from the fossa without difficulty. On extraction of the gallbladder through the umbilical incision, a large stone in the gallbladder could be palpated. After several attempts of extraction, the retrieval bag perforated and stones spilled into the abdomen. Not all the spilled stones could be retrieved. The woman had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was discharged to home on postoperative day 2. Two weeks after surgery, she was evaluated for persistent mild abdominal pain in clinic.

He complained of nausea, vomiting, and asthenia as well. His medical history was significant for pharyngitis associated with scarlet fever that he had a month before; the pharyngitis was treated by his general practitioner with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily for a week). No throat culture or rapid antigen test for group A streptococci was performed at that time. On physical examination, he presented with mild right upper abdominal quadrant tenderness.

What Is the Diagnosis?",Hydatid cyst,Infected biliary cystadenoma,Hepatic abscess,Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver,C. Hepatic abscess,C,Hepatic abscess,"In this case of group C streptococci–related liver abscess following pharyngitis and scarlet fever, the radiological features were not typical of a simple cyst or of a biliary cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma, given the multiloculated aspect and the absence of contrast enhancement in the septa. The probability of a diagnosis of hydatid cyst was low owing to the patient’s history and the absence of calcifications. Therefore, being suspicious of an infectious etiology, we decided to perform an ultrasonography-guided diagnostic puncture of the hepatic lesion, which yielded a purulent fluid. A percutaneous drain was positioned. A fluid sample was sent to the laboratory for both microbiological and cytological examinations and evidenced necrotic debris in which β-hemolytic group C Streptococcus was isolated. Levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) was administered based on the antibiogram, which also showed that the strain of Streptococcus was resistant to clarithromycin. No primary abdominal infectious foci were apparent on the radiological images. A diagnostic workup was completed with a colonoscopy and an echocardiography, the results of which were negative. Positron emission computed tomography revealed, in addition to an intense enhancement in the liver abscess, a hypermetabolic lymph node located in the anterior mandibular region, ostensibly an issue of the previous pharyngitis. The patient’s course was favorable, and he was discharged from the hospital on day 14, after the removal of the percutaneous drain.Liver abscess is a rare condition with an incidence of 13 to 20 cases per 100 000 population per year.1 Abscesses are more often of a biliary or portal origin. Arterial bacteremia, traumatic injury, and the spread of the abscess by contiguity are more unusual causes. Ten percent to 30% of abscesses are idiopathic. A fever and upper right abdominal pain are the most common symptoms. Jaundice is observed in 25% to 30% of the patients. Aerobic gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria are the most common types of bacteria isolated, accounting for 40% to 60% cases and 40% to 50% of cases, respectively.2 Aerobic gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, α- and β-hemolytic streptococci, and group D streptococci) are isolated in 10% to 20% cases.3 The treatment consists of percutaneous drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, which is adapted according to the antibiogram of the isolates. Surgery is rarely indicated in the case of failure of the percutaneous drain.Scarlet fever is a common pediatric disease, and it is usually caused by pyrogenic toxin-producing group A streptococci. In most cases, it is consequent to an upper respiratory tract infection (“strep throat”). The prognosis is usually good after a timely diagnosis and proper antibiotic therapy, which is effective in reducing the incidence of scarlet fever’s most feared complications (ie, rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis).4 Other complications include osteomyelitis, arthritis, otitis media, hepatitis, meningitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis.5,6β-Hemolytic streptococci of a group other than A and B are known to cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including abscesses,7 more frequently in elderly and immunocompromised patients, but invasive infections are also observed in immunocompetent individuals.8 Occasionally, scarlet fever can be caused by β-hemolytic group C streptococci,9 whose resistance to macrolides in patients with an invasive infection has been previously described.10To the best of our knowledge, a liver abscess caused by group C streptococci following scarlet fever has never been reported. Even if the pharyngeal origin of the Streptococcus could not be formally demonstrated, the pathogenetic link between the previous pharyngitis and the liver abscess in our case is established by the fact that scarlet fever is an exotoxin-mediated disease arising from β-hemolytic streptococcal infection. In this instance, the abscess was most likely the consequence of a transient group C streptococcal bacteremia. Our young patient had no detectable immunodeficiency, which is noteworthy because it stresses that, even in immunocompetent individuals, this pathology should be considered. Finally, the case report once more highlights the paramount importance of obtaining liver abscess fluid cultures in order to search for ongoing or previous infectious foci and to administer the appropriate antibiotics.",Surgery,"A 26-year-old patient was admitted to our institution for a fever (temperature, 39°C) and abdominal pain on the right side of their hypochondrium.

The patient’s obstructive symptoms resolved, and he was discharged home on postoperative day 7.Surgical specimen showing a fistulous tract with surrounding inflammatory changes in the small bowel (arrowhead).Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the criterion standard in managing acute cholecystitis. The gallbladder can be perforated in approximately 40% of cases, typically during dissection from the fossa or extraction of the specimen.2-4 In addition, gallbladder perforation is more common when acute cholecystitis is the indication for cholecystectomy. Spilled gallstones are harder to retrieve with laparoscopy than with open cholecystectomy. The incidence of unretrieved spilled gallstones is reported to be as high as 33%.2,3 Strategies recommended for the intraoperative management of spilled gallstones include steps to minimize further spillage, attempt stone retrieval, and perform copious irrigation and suction.5 Although having unretrieved gallstones during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not an absolute indication for conversion to laparotomy, adequate documentation regarding lost gallstones should be dictated in the operative report because complications can occur many years after surgery.6Lost gallstones can migrate throughout the intraperitoneal cavity.

Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst,D,Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst,"The differential diagnosis for acute urinary retention, lower extremity hyperreflexia, and intermittent sensory or motor deficits dependent on activity and position includes spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, anterior thoracolumbar spinal cord herniation, and symptomatic thoracic arachnoid cysts. Our initial concern that it was a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula led us to perform magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine using FIESTA sequences in hopes of visualizing dilated serpentine spinal veins that may be seen in this entity. The findings were not consistent with a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula but rather demonstrated a flattened spinal cord with edema at the T7-T8 vertebral level (Figure), which is thought to be most compatible with anterior spinal cord herniation or a symptomatic arachnoid cyst. A subsequent computed tomographic myelogram confirmed the presence of a 14.0 × 8.4-mm posterior extradural arachnoid cyst obstructing the free flow of the contrast agent and causing intermittent deformity of the spinal cord at the T7 level with cerebrospinal fluid pulsation (Video).Spinal arachnoid cysts are uncommon protrusions of the spinal cord that rarely cause symptomatic compression of the cord. Although their pathogenesis is poorly understood, they are thought to arise from congenital deformities or dural trauma.1-3 Although magnetic resonance imaging is useful for identifying a soft tissue mass, computed tomographic myelography is the diagnostic study of choice for spinal dural arachnoid cysts because it can reveal a cyst’s access to the subarachnoid space.2,4-6 Furthermore, the dynamic nature of computed tomographic myelography enables real-time visualization of cerebrospinal fluid pulsations accounting for intermittent cord compression by the cyst and the resultant episodic symptoms. The origin of these pulsations has been suggested to be primarily related to the cardia, arising from intracranial pulsations in the cerebrovascular bed and choroid plexus, along with local pulsations in the spinovascular beds.7,8 Respiration has also been shown to variably influence the magnitude and duration of cerebrospinal fluid pulsations.9The definitive treatment of spinal arachnoid cysts is complete surgical excision of the cyst with repair of the communicating dural defect.2 The prognosis is favorable, often with complete resolution of neurological symptoms following operative resection. Those presenting with a shorter duration of symptoms tend to have better outcomes than those with a more prolonged duration.10 Urinary retention may be reversible or irreversible depending on the duration and extent of cord compression.The patient underwent T7-T8 laminectomy with resection of the cyst and experienced immediate resolution of sensory symptoms.

He had a 50-year history of cigarette smoking and had stopped smoking 5 months prior to being seen.When the symptom of hemoptysis occurred 5 months earlier, chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) revealed a ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe. The patient was treated with an antifibrinolytic agent (tranexamic acid), and the hemoptysis gradually improved and follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of the lesion (Figure 1). However, about 1 month later, hemoptysis reoccurred and increased volume and frequency over the following 4 months.After treatment with an antifibrinolytic agent, a ball-like mass with an air crescent sign in the left upper lobe was noted.On physical examination, sonorous rhonchi were audible in the bilateral lungs.

The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (Figure 2). No fungal elements were noted in the tissue specimens.The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×100).The pulmonary air crescent sign is typically seen with a mycetoma (fungus ball) located in a preexisting thin-walled cavity with a smooth inner margin, most often formed by a previous tuberculous infection.1,2 Pulmonary mycetoma usually manifests as an upper lobe cavitary lesion with an intracavitary mobile mass and an air crescent on the periphery.3,4 It is relatively straightforward to diagnose pulmonary mycetoma by the presence of a solid, round or oval mass with soft-tissue opacity within a lung cavity. In addition, a mycetoma usually moves when the patient changes position.5 Therefore, the classic CT scan workup of a mycetoma should include both supine and prone studies to demonstrate whether the central mass is free or attached to the cystic wall. Furthermore, the presence or absence of contrast enhancement within the mass on CT images may help differentiate between a mycetoma and other conditions such as malignancy or active infection.Cavitary neoplasms, tuberculosis, hydatid cysts (alveolar echinococcosis), and bacterial lung abscess may also give rise to an air crescent sign.2 Cavitation is a common radiologic presentation of lung cancer and more frequently found in squamous cell carcinoma. It is well known that the cancerous cavity often has a thick wall with an irregular inner surface.3 Part of the wall may project into the cavity, forming a so-called mural nodule. In contrast to a mycetoma, cavitary lung cancers rarely present with thin-walled cavities resembling cysts.3In conclusion, though the air crescent sign is most often associated with benign diseases such as mycetoma, physicians should consider it as a potential indicator of lung cancer.",Surgery,"A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a concern of productive cough, profuse hemoptysis, and intermittent breathlessness for about 5 months.

Perforation was noted in the gallbladder wall adjacent to the liver with hemorrhagic contents.Cholelithiasis is an extremely common diagnosis in Americans, affecting approximately 20% of the population, one-third of whom will go on to develop cholecystitis.1 However, both hemorrhagic cholecystitis and perforated cholecystitis are uncommon. Gallbladder perforation due to ischemia and gangrene occurs in only 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis and is associated with a mortality rate of up to 70%.2 Case reports of hemorrhagic cholecystitis are most consistently associated with malignancy or bleeding diathesis but can be related to obstructive cholecystitis, trauma, percutaneous interventions, or parasites. Diagnosis of hemorrhagic cholecystitis can be difficult because the presentation can range from a simple cholecystitis to acute abdomen pain. Prompt diagnosis is necessary to avoid significant morbidity and mortality.3-5Although there are, to our knowledge, no randomized studies or case series published on perforated hemorrhagic cholecystitis, most case reports recommend evaluating with ultrasonography or computed tomography if there is concern for this pathology. However, it should be noted that it can be difficult to see perforation on ultrasonography. There are several studies6,7 that emphasize the utility of computed tomography in the setting of complications of acute cholecystitis. Computed tomography also offers several distinct advantages over ultrasonography, including widespread availability, speed of imaging, lack of operator dependence, and increased anatomical coverage.5,6 Most reports agree that cholecystectomy is the appropriate treatment.After correction of coagulopathy and packed red blood cell transfusion, the patient was taken to the operating room to proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Ileocolic intussusception,B,Ileocolic intussusception,"This patient presented with recurrent bowel obstruction due to an extensive ileocolic intussusception. The diagnosis was made radiographically based on the presence of classic computed tomography findings, including targetlike and sausage-shaped masses, a rim of oral contrast encircling the intussusceptum, and the pathognomonic bowel-within-bowel appearance of intraluminal mesenteric fat and vessels (Figure 1).1Although the patient had hoped to avoid surgery based on her religious beliefs, nonoperative management failed at 11 months and she agreed to an operation. Intraoperatively, the intussusception extended from the ileocolic junction to mid-descending colon and was reduced primarily to reveal complete inversion of the appendix into the cecum. An ileocecectomy with primary ileocolonic anastomosis was performed and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 5. The appendix was reduced in the postoperative specimen and noted to be grossly fibrotic.This patient had a history of juvenile polyposis syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple gastrointestinal hamartomas in the colon or rectum (98%), stomach (14%), small bowel (7%), and duodenum (2%).2 Final pathology revealed a clustering of at least 8 juvenile polyps in the cecum extending into the appendiceal orifice, which was noted on colonoscopy performed during the patient’s first admission (Figure 2). Prior to surgery, an ileal mass was suspected as the most likely lead point for intussusception. However, intraoperative findings and final pathology suggested a different mechanism whereby the appendiceal masses initiated an appendiceal intussusception that then served as the mechanical lead point for ileocolic intussusception. Alternatively, the mass of cecal polyps may have acted as the initial lead point for intestinal intussusception and caused a secondary or simultaneous appendiceal intussusception by tethering the base of the appendix.Colonoscopic view of the cecum demonstrating extension of a cluster of juvenile polyps extending into the appendiceal orifice (arrowhead). Image courtesy of Eduardo Gonzalez-Velez, MD.Intussusception is a rare cause of bowel obstruction in adults, accounting for less than 1% of obstructions and 5% of total intussusception cases.1,3-6 Symptoms are nonspecific, often chronic or subacute, and include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and blood per rectum. Surgical management is generally indicated since up to 90% of cases are associated with an underlying pathological process, such as benign and malignant tumors, vascular anomalies, and inflammatory lesions that act as anatomical lead points.3-6 Appendiceal intussusception is even more rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.01% based on a study of 71 000 human appendix surgical specimens.7 Patients may present acutely with symptoms mimicking appendicitis or have a more protracted history of nonspecific, intermittent symptoms similar to intestinal intussusception. Adult women are disproportionately affected (76% of adult cases, 54% of all cases), with appendiceal endometriosis as the most commonly identified lead point in adults (33%). Additional causes include mucocele (19%), inflammation (19%), adenoma (11%), carcinoid (7%), and adenocarcinoma (6%).8,9Intramural and intraluminal gastrointestinal lesions are believed to cause intussusception by altering normal peristaltic activity, resulting in more vigorous and frequent peristaltic contractions meant to expel the offending lesion. For bowel, this may result in invagination or telescoping of one segment of the bowel (the “intussusceptum”) into the other (the “intussuscipiens”).1-4 For the appendix, in the setting of appropriate anatomic factors such as a fetal-type cecum, mobile mesoappendix, or wide proximal appendicular lumen, partial or total inversion into the cecum may occur.9 Appendiceal intussusception puts the patient at high risk for developing intestinal intussusception, as was likely the case for this patient, because the inverted appendix has been shown to act as a lead point for a subsequent compound ileocolic intussusception.8-10",Surgery,"A 34-year-old female Jehovah’s Witness presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of colicky lower abdominal pain, nausea without vomiting, and constipation after passing a single small bloody bowel movement.

Gastric duplication,C,Gastric duplication,"Initial abdominal and pelvic computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated a large (9.8 × 7.4 × 7.6-cm) heterogeneous mass located in the fundus and body of the stomach with areas of enhancement, suspicious for a possible gastrointestinal stromal tumor. On upper endoscopy, the mass occupied the upper half of the stomach, including the gastroesophageal junction, but did not extend proximally into the esophagus. Specimens obtained during progressively deeper biopsies on 2 successive occasions revealed no pathologic diagnosis.Preoperatively, endoscopic ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration biopsy was considered.1,2 Social issues prevented the patient from undergoing this test. The mass was surgically resected for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged home on hospital day 8. Final pathology examination revealed this lesion to be composed of stomach duplication tissue, confirming a diagnosis of gastric duplication cyst (Figure 2).Gross pathologic examination of the specimen demonstrates a noncommunicating gastric duplication cyst. The inset demonstrates gastric mucosal lining on either side of the gastric duplication wall (hematoxylin-eosin; original magnification ×20).Gastrointestinal duplication cysts are a rare congenital anomaly, accounting for approximately 4% of all intestinal duplications. 3,4 In 1959, Rowling5 proposed 3 morphologic criteria for the correct diagnosis of gastric duplication cysts: first, the cyst must be contiguous with the stomach wall; second, the cyst must be surrounded by at least 1 coat of smooth muscle, fusing with muscularis propria of the stomach; and third, the cyst must be lined with typical gastric mucosa. Figure 2 depicts normal gastric mucosa, a common muscularis, and attenuated gastric mucosa of the duplication on the right. The clinical presentation generally includes bowel obstruction or gastrointestinal bleeding early in life; torsion, hemorrhage, pancreatitis, and fistula formation may also occur.3,5-8 Rarely does gastric duplication present in adulthood.9 Malignant transformation has been identified in patients with gastric duplication; thus, complete resection is recommended at the time of diagnosis.10There was an associated small, noncommunicating esophageal duplication as noted. Findings at surgery included a large proximal gastric mass fibrotically adherent to the diaphragm in a desmoplastic and presumed neoplastic fashion. Total gastrectomy with removal of adherent diaphragm was undertaken with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy.

Retroperitoneal liposarcoma,D,Retroperitoneal liposarcoma,"The computed tomographic scan demonstrated a large left-sided retroperitoneal mass of fatty/solid consistency, which encased the left kidney and displaced the left colon to the right. Based on these findings, the clinical diagnosis of retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RPLS) was made and surgical resection was planned.The left colon and its mesentery were dissected from the tumor, and the left ureter was identified and carefully protected. The kidney capsule was peeled from the parenchyma to preserve the left kidney. Ultimately, the tumor was successfully removed en bloc with the left adrenal gland, while the spleen, pancreas, and colon were preserved (Figure 2). Histological examination confirmed the tumor as a myxoid liposarcoma with dedifferentiated features and a focally positive margin.Excised fatty tumor; it was 42.5 × 39.5 × 19.5 cm and 16.8 kg.Liposarcoma is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma and represents 41% of those in the retroperitoneum.1,2 Patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma often remain asymptomatic until their tumor grows very large (>10 cm), and the presenting symptoms include increased abdominal girth or swelling, early satiety, abdominal and/or back pain, and a palpable mass.3 The diagnosis can be made by either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Preoperative needle biopsy is not recommended because the procedure carries the risk of tumor seeding and the result unlikely changes the treatment plan.While complete surgical resection is the ultimate goal of treatment for patients with RPLS, obtaining a microscopic negative margin can be challenging, given the similarity between tumor pseudocapsule and adjacent fatty tissue. In an article from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,4 microscopic negative margin was achieved in only 44% of patients. Because of the proximity of the tumor, en bloc nephrectomy is sometimes necessary for complete clearance of retroperitoneal sarcoma. However, because true parenchymal involvement by retroperitoneal sarcoma was reported to be far less common (9%) than capsular invasion (15%),5 and because nephrectomy did not improve overall survival or local control in patients with RPLS,4 nephrectomy is not necessary for most patients with RPLS, like this patient.The median survival for patients with RPLS who underwent surgical resection has been reported at 83 months.4 Although dedifferentiated features were reported to increase the risk of tumor recurrence and death,4 there is no adjuvant therapy protocol that has effectively proved to improve survival for patients with dedifferentiated RPLS.3,4 This patient elected to receive no adjuvant therapy and has had close follow-up.

The patient was treated with an antifibrinolytic agent (tranexamic acid), and the hemoptysis gradually improved and follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of the lesion (Figure 1). However, about 1 month later, hemoptysis reoccurred and increased volume and frequency over the following 4 months.After treatment with an antifibrinolytic agent, a ball-like mass with an air crescent sign in the left upper lobe was noted.On physical examination, sonorous rhonchi were audible in the bilateral lungs.

The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (Figure 2). No fungal elements were noted in the tissue specimens.The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×100).The pulmonary air crescent sign is typically seen with a mycetoma (fungus ball) located in a preexisting thin-walled cavity with a smooth inner margin, most often formed by a previous tuberculous infection.1,2 Pulmonary mycetoma usually manifests as an upper lobe cavitary lesion with an intracavitary mobile mass and an air crescent on the periphery.3,4 It is relatively straightforward to diagnose pulmonary mycetoma by the presence of a solid, round or oval mass with soft-tissue opacity within a lung cavity. In addition, a mycetoma usually moves when the patient changes position.5 Therefore, the classic CT scan workup of a mycetoma should include both supine and prone studies to demonstrate whether the central mass is free or attached to the cystic wall. Furthermore, the presence or absence of contrast enhancement within the mass on CT images may help differentiate between a mycetoma and other conditions such as malignancy or active infection.Cavitary neoplasms, tuberculosis, hydatid cysts (alveolar echinococcosis), and bacterial lung abscess may also give rise to an air crescent sign.2 Cavitation is a common radiologic presentation of lung cancer and more frequently found in squamous cell carcinoma. It is well known that the cancerous cavity often has a thick wall with an irregular inner surface.3 Part of the wall may project into the cavity, forming a so-called mural nodule. In contrast to a mycetoma, cavitary lung cancers rarely present with thin-walled cavities resembling cysts.3In conclusion, though the air crescent sign is most often associated with benign diseases such as mycetoma, physicians should consider it as a potential indicator of lung cancer.",Surgery,"A 62-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a concern of productive cough, profuse hemoptysis, and intermittent breathlessness for about 5 months.

Contrast-enhancing gallbladder,C,Contrast-enhancing gallbladder,"This patient’s CT showed an abnormal finding adjacent to his duodenum, initially concerning for contrast extravasation. On further review, this CT finding was determined to be an artifact produced by vicarious contrast medium excretion (VCME) into the gallbladder. There was no evidence of active extravasation on postembolization imaging, including no persistence of the contrast blush from the known renal laceration.Vicarious contrast medium excretion is a known but rarely reported imaging phenomenon. In cases of blunt trauma, when CT is often used to diagnose injury, vicarious excretion of iodinated contrast medium can cause diagnostic error and subsequent unnecessary testing or intervention. This report highlights a potentially misleading imaging artifact in a patient with blunt trauma secondary to VCME.The excretion of water-soluble contrast medium via the kidneys is a well-described process. When contrast medium is injected to obtain an intravenous pyelogram or angiogram, such as with protocoled CT for trauma, we expect to see renal excretion of the contrast medium on delayed-phase images. Vicarious contrast medium excretion refers to the excretion of water-soluble contrast medium through a route other than renal secretion.1 This type of excretion is predominantly mediated by the biliary system but may also occur in the small intestine, stomach, and colon.1-6 The image shown above (Figure, B) illustrates VCME by the biliary tract into the gallbladder lumen, which is also described as gallbladder opacification.Gallbladder opacification is defined as a radiograph or CT that demonstrates complete or partial opacification of the gallbladder cavity, which appears as a filled, hyperattenuated, or hyperdense structure.2 Earlier studies have demonstrated that VCME and its most common variant, gallbladder opacification, are associated with increased serum creatinine levels, unilateral renal pathologic findings, high-contrast dosing, frequent contrast loads secondary to multiple imaging studies, hypotension, and gallbladder stasis.1-3,6,7 Other studies have shown VCME and gallbladder opacification to be normal variants that may occur in patients with normal renal function.7-9 This patient had several risk factors for VCME, including unilateral renal disease, elevated serum creatinine levels, multiple contrast loads over a 48-hour period, and mild hypotension. Because of early recognition that the imaging artifact was attributable to VCME rather than to active hemorrhage, the patient was spared errors in diagnosis or misguided interventions.This case highlights how imaging artifacts caused by VCME may be misleading and could result in misdiagnosis or unwarranted procedures. Practicing surgeons should be aware of VCME and be able to recognize the hallmarks of VCME on common imaging studies.",Surgery,"A woman in her 60s with a known history of a large cyst on the right kidney sustained blunt trauma in a skiing crash.

Mucocele of the appendix,C,Mucocele of the appendix,"The CT scan demonstrated a large right-sided cystic mass arising from the appendix. Based on these findings, the clinical diagnosis of mucocele of the appendix was made and a surgical resection was planned. The normal colonoscopy results excluded cecal carcinoma. Neuroendocrine tumors arising from the appendix usually present with symptoms of acute appendicitis.1 The CT scan appearances are not consistent with that of an appendix abscess.Mucocele of the appendix is an obstructive dilatation of the appendix caused by an intraluminal accumulation of mucoid material, secondary to 1 of the following processes: retention cyst, mucosal hyperplasia, mucinous cystadenoma, or mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.2 Mucoceles are found in 0.2% to 0.3% of all appendectomy specimens.3 Around 50% of patients are asymptomatic at the time of presentation when the mucocele is found as an incidental finding. Other patients may present with abdominal pain, abdominal mass, weight loss, or acute appendicitis.4 The presence of symptoms is associated with a higher incidence of cystadenocarcinoma.The diagnosis is usually confirmed with a CT scan, which characteristically shows a well-encapsulated cystic mass that is usually in the right lower quadrant. Curvilinear mural calcification is seen in 50% of cases.5 Cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas are typically larger and are associated with a 20% incidence of perforation. Perforation is indicated by the presence of ascites in the pelvis and the right upper quadrant.When a mucocele perforates, it releases mucoid material into the peritoneal cavity. This material may be acellular or may contain dysplastic cells. Patients with a spillage of mucus into the peritoneal cavity containing epithelial cells have a different prognosis than those with intact mucoceles, and a specimen of the fluid should be sent for analysis.5 In cases with epithelial cell contamination, patients may progress to developing pseudomyxoma peritonei, peritoneal carcinomatosis, or peritoneal tumors, which is why it is important to keep mucoceles intact during excisions. Peritoneal carcinomatosis may be treated with a combination of cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and patients should be referred to a peritoneal carcinomatosis treatment center for this definitive treatment.6 If a large mucocele is found during laparoscopy, conversion to laparotomy is safer, as it allows the specimen to be removed without rupturing and also allows for an exploration for mucoid fluid.7Excising a mucocele does not have to extend to the right hemicolectomy, unless there is an involvement of the appendiceal or ileocolic lymph nodes, although this is unusual. If a frozen section of the appendix shows a spread of tumor cells longitudinally, this would also require a right hemicolectomy to allow for an adequate removal.8The patient underwent a laparotomy during which a huge cystic lesion occupying much of the right side of the abdomen was found (Figure 2). Medial and lateral adhesions were divided to mobilize the mass. A limited right hemicolectomy was performed to remove the bowel and lesion en masse. The histology of the specimen confirmed a mucinous cystadenoma originating from the appendix. Following the operation, she made an uneventful recovery, required no further treatment, and is doing well.At laparotomy, a large cystic mass (black arrowhead) was found arising from the cecum (white arrowhead).

The patient underwent a laparotomy, which confirmed the diagnosis of SBV in a 720° counterclockwise rotation (Figure 2B). A 5-cm jejunal diverticulum, with adhesion to the transverse mesocolon located 50 cm below the ligament of Treitz, was identified as the cause of this volvulus, and some additional adhesion between the greater omentum and the right ovary that occurred owing to the influence of the oophorectomy complicated this phenomenon. Reduction of the volvulus, lysis of the adhesions, and resection of the jejunal diverticulum were performed. She had an uneventful recovery.A, Typical corkscrew vessels and both tapering and obstruction of the superior mesenteric artery are shown by use of a 3-dimensional reconstruction of a computed tomographic angiographic scan. B, Encircled loops of the small-bowel volvulus around the superior mesenteric artery.Whether the whirl sign, first described by Fisher,1 is a specific characteristic of SBV has been controversial.2 This sign was found to be a nonspecific result of any process that causes twisting or rotation of the mesentery and its contents.3 This sign predicts the need for surgical intervention for small-bowel obstruction.4 The best method for the detection of SBV by determining the existence of corkscrew vessels is by use of a 3-dimensional reconstruction of an CT angiographic scan, which can preoperatively reveal the peripheral blood flow of the small bowel from collateral vessels despite the obstruction of the SMA. For the present patient, we could not detect postoperatively any tapering or obstruction of the SMA or SMV on the 3-dimensional reconstruction of the CT scan.The whirl sign may indicate the possibility of reversible volvulus of the small bowel. We believe that this is why our patient had a long recurrent history of SBV. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the whirl sign is not an ominous sign. Without surgery, our patient would have continued to be in danger of having massive bowel necrosis. The indication for surgery in such a case should depend on the patient’s abdominal physical signs and symptoms, and not on the CT scans alone. Cases in which the entire small bowel revolves on the thick root of both the SMA and the SMV may lead to reversibility of the volvulus.In our patient, a jejunal diverticulum 5 cm in size existed on the opposite side of the mesentery; pathologically, it was not congenital jejunal duplication but multiple diverticula. Cases of SBV involving a jejunal diverticulum have been reported more often in Asia than in the West.5-7 The incidence of diverticulum of the jejunum may be high in Asia. It is reported that small-bowel diverticulum in older people is an independent risk factor for SBV,8 and large diverticulum of the small bowel, in particular, might play a contributing role in the occurrence of SBV in adults.9 In light of the findings pertaining to our patient, the swinging of the jejunal diverticulum due to its position, size, weight, and adhesion or the presence of a long mobile mesentery and a shorter mesenteric base10 may be necessary for this rare condition to occur.",Surgery,"A 90-year-old woman presented with vomiting and acute abdominal pain that started 24 hours earlier.

Superior lumbar hernia (Grynfeltt-Lesshaft hernia),C,Superior lumbar hernia (Grynfeltt-Lesshaft hernia),"First described more than 4 centuries ago, lumbar hernias are rare defects of the posterior abdominal wall, with only 300 cases reported in the literature.1 Bounded by the 12th rib, iliac crest, erector spinae muscle, and external oblique muscle, the lumbar region can be further divided into the superior Grynfeltt-Lesshaft triangle and the inferior Petit triangle. The larger, more common area for lumbar hernia is within the Grynfeltt-Lesshaft triangle, defined by the 12th rib superiorly, quadratus lumborum medially, and internal oblique laterally.2 Lumbar hernias can be congenital or acquired in nature, and acquired hernias can be primary (spontaneous) or secondary (traumatic or incisional) in etiology.2 Incisional lumbar hernias have historically been most associated with nephrectomy, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, resection of abdominal wall tumors, iliac bone donations, and latissimus dorsi flaps in plastic surgery.1 Because of the rarity of lumbar hernias, diagnosis is often challenging and requires clinical suspicion to avoid misdiagnosis and the potential complications of such hernias. Patient presentation is often variable and nonspecific, ranging from an asymptomatic bulge, to a lumbago with a palpable mass that increases with strenuous activity, to vague abdominal discomfort with changes in bowel or bladder function. Contents of the hernia sac may include colon, omentum, small bowel, kidney, spleen, or stomach, with a potential risk for incarceration or strangulation and the resulting sequelae.1 Thorough physical examination and a high index of suspicion are critical to guiding the selection of supporting imaging studies for lumbar hernias. Extraperitoneal fat herniated through a wall defect may mimic a lipoma, which may be incorrectly confirmed if ultrasound is performed and interpreted by an inexperienced technologist.3 However, computed tomography is more likely to make a definitive diagnosis and add information on parietal defect size, hernia content, and muscular atrophy.4Given this patient’s extensive lumbar surgical history, clinical suspicion of a lumbar hernia had to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Although the physical characteristics of the patient’s mass may have been suggestive of other pathologies that manifest as a superficial flank mass more commonly, such as a lipoma, the reducibility of the mass on prone positioning and prominence with cough impulse was more suggestive of lumbar hernia.5 The addition of computed tomography to the preoperative workup was essential for distinguishing a true lumbar hernia from posterior lateral wall muscular atrophy with pseudohernia. Flank incisions, as may be encountered with this patient’s surgical history, can result in denervation injury to intercostal nerves and laxity of the oblique abdominal wall musculature, without true fascial defect.6 There was nothing to suggest local or systemic infection in the patient’s history or physical examination. No skin changes or pain overlying the palpable mass was observed on physical examination, and computed tomography did not demonstrate a fluid collection but rather a Grynfeltt-Lesshaft lumbar hernia containing a portion of incarcerated colon. After the correct diagnosis was made, the patient underwent a successful laparoscopic repair with mesh.",Surgery,"A 65-year-old woman was seen at the surgical clinic with reports of chronic back pain and a bulge in her back.

Gallbladder volvulus,D,Gallbladder volvulus,"The computed tomographic image (Figure) shows gallbladder volvulus, with the classic “whirl” sign described by Fisher1 for mesenteric ischemia. At laparoscopy, the patient was found to have a gangrenous gallbladder with volvulus; it was untwisted and then successfully removed laparoscopically. Because gallbladder volvulus is associated with a necrotic gallbladder, it should be treated emergently with surgery with no role for expectant or conservative management, even in elderly patients or those with multiple medical comorbidities. Gallbladder volvulus is traditionally associated with elderly women, with a 3:1 female to male ratio. Pathophysiology is associated with torsion around a gallbladder that is often not firmly attached to the liver bed, a so-called floating gallbladder, with a long cystic artery and cystic duct.2 It is easily confused with other causes of peritonitis, particularly acute cholecystitis, and is often only discovered at the time of surgery.3Preoperative diagnosis is difficult owing to the advanced age of most patients, in whom the abdominal examination may be unreliable or subtle signs can be overlooked. Additionally, the classically described signs of floating gallbladder and bull’s-eye or whirl signs are often not seen. Kitagawa et al4 describe the most reliable findings associated with gallbladder volvulus as the following: (1) dilated horizontal gallbladder; (2) thickened gallbladder wall and poor wall enhancement; (3) fluid collection between the gallbladder and the liver, indicating a floating gallbladder; and (4) the presence of a well-enhanced cystic duct located on the right side of the gallbladder. Any of these signs, including the rarely seen whirl sign, are indications for immediate surgical treatment. It is important to distinguish these signs of gallbladder volvulus from classic acute cholecystitis to avoid delay in surgical management, particularly in elderly patients for whom there is little physiological reserve. Laparoscopy can be attempted when gallbladder volvulus is recognized early, but it is often unsuccessful.5 If laparoscopy is attempted, the gallbladder must be untwisted to avoid injury to the common duct, which can be tented up from the volvulus.6,7",Surgery,"An 89-year-old patient presented to them geriatrician with abdominal pain for 2 days.

Retroperitoneal liposarcoma,D,Retroperitoneal liposarcoma,"The computed tomographic scan demonstrated a large left-sided retroperitoneal mass of fatty/solid consistency, which encased the left kidney and displaced the left colon to the right. Based on these findings, the clinical diagnosis of retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RPLS) was made and surgical resection was planned.The left colon and its mesentery were dissected from the tumor, and the left ureter was identified and carefully protected. The kidney capsule was peeled from the parenchyma to preserve the left kidney. Ultimately, the tumor was successfully removed en bloc with the left adrenal gland, while the spleen, pancreas, and colon were preserved (Figure 2). Histological examination confirmed the tumor as a myxoid liposarcoma with dedifferentiated features and a focally positive margin.Excised fatty tumor; it was 42.5 × 39.5 × 19.5 cm and 16.8 kg.Liposarcoma is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma and represents 41% of those in the retroperitoneum.1,2 Patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma often remain asymptomatic until their tumor grows very large (>10 cm), and the presenting symptoms include increased abdominal girth or swelling, early satiety, abdominal and/or back pain, and a palpable mass.3 The diagnosis can be made by either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Preoperative needle biopsy is not recommended because the procedure carries the risk of tumor seeding and the result unlikely changes the treatment plan.While complete surgical resection is the ultimate goal of treatment for patients with RPLS, obtaining a microscopic negative margin can be challenging, given the similarity between tumor pseudocapsule and adjacent fatty tissue. In an article from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,4 microscopic negative margin was achieved in only 44% of patients. Because of the proximity of the tumor, en bloc nephrectomy is sometimes necessary for complete clearance of retroperitoneal sarcoma. However, because true parenchymal involvement by retroperitoneal sarcoma was reported to be far less common (9%) than capsular invasion (15%),5 and because nephrectomy did not improve overall survival or local control in patients with RPLS,4 nephrectomy is not necessary for most patients with RPLS, like this patient.The median survival for patients with RPLS who underwent surgical resection has been reported at 83 months.4 Although dedifferentiated features were reported to increase the risk of tumor recurrence and death,4 there is no adjuvant therapy protocol that has effectively proved to improve survival for patients with dedifferentiated RPLS.3,4 This patient elected to receive no adjuvant therapy and has had close follow-up.

Inclusion cyst,C,Inclusion cyst,"Esophageal cysts can account for 10% to 15% of all primary masses of the mediastinum.1,2 Traditionally, congenital cysts of the esophagus can be classified as either inclusion or duplication.3 Both arise from failure of vacuolization of the esophagus early in fetal development, but differ histologically. Esophageal inclusion cysts are located intramurally and contain squamous or columnar epithelium that may or may not be ciliated. They do not contain muscle layers or cartilage.4 Duplication cysts are also usually located in the esophageal wall, but are covered with muscle layers.5 Symptoms associated with congenital esophageal cysts can mimic many gastrointestinal conditions depending on the size and location.6 Although these symptoms usually occur in childhood, they may also present later in life as dysphagia, weight loss, and gastroesophageal reflux, unresponsive to acid-suppressive therapy,4 as well as rare progression to malignancy.7 Imaging modalities including upper endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasonography can confirm the diagnosis by the cystic nature and localization within one of the layers of the esophagus.8We postulate that the unusual floppiness of the cyst led to the occlusion of the gastroesophageal junction and resolution of reflux in the reclining position while making dysphagia worse. Since the patient was symptomatic, she underwent laparoscopic resection of the cyst. The posterolateral location at the gastroesophageal junction made it difficult to approach the lesion with the standard anterior approach used for Heller myotomy. Hence, we resected the cyst in a transgastric fashion (Figure 2). First, a horizontal gastrostomy was made 5 cm distal to the gastroesophageal junction. The mass was mobilized along with the overlying mucosa and then resected at the neck using an Endo-GIA stapler (Medtronic), sparing the lower esophageal sphincter. Gross pathology revealed a pink-tan soft tissue mass measuring 4.1 × 1.1 × 0.9 cm.

There were no DNA mismatch repair genes absent, nor was microsatellite instability appreciated. Staging studies demonstrated enhanced perirectal lymph nodes with no signs of distant metastasis. The patient underwent a total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy. The final pathology specimen (Figure 2) was consistent with multifocal, high-grade adenocarcinoma involving the rectum, sigmoid, and descending colon with negative margins and 43 of 150 lymph nodes positive for metastatic disease, staging the cancer as T4aN2bM0.The incidence of UC in young adults is rising. Ulcerative colitis increases the amount of exposure the colonic mucosa has to inflammatory cytokines.1 These inflammation flares are thought to increase the rate of colon cancer in patients with UC by activation of epithelial cell survival pathways such as proliferation and reactive oxygen species damage to DNA.1,2 A diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis further increases the risk of colon cancer; however, the pathogenesis is not fully understood.1A patient’s risk for colon cancer increases in proportion to the amount of time elapsed since the diagnosis of UC. The risk is estimated to be approximately 2%, 8%, and 18% by year 10, 20, and 30 after diagnosis, respectively.3 Overall, the rate of colon cancer in patients with UC is on the decline, which is likely secondary to improvements in medical therapy for UC and screening for colon cancer in addition to early total colectomies.4 Screening guidelines differ among different international societies. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommends annual colonoscopies with random biopsies beginning 8 years after the diagnosis of UC.5Patients with UC have a 2.4-fold increased rate of developing colon cancer compared with the general population.2 Ulcerative colitis–associated colon cancer (UCC) does not follow the typical adenoma to carcinoma course. Rather, UCC precursor lesions are usually nonadenomatous dysplastic epithelial cells.1,2 Many of the genetics insults seen in sporadic colon cancer, such as microsatellite instability, aneuploidy, and mutations in TP53, KRAS, and BCL2 genes, are also seen in UCC. However, these insults are usually found earlier in patients with UC, even before the development of colon cancer.2 These early insults are likely secondary from reactive oxygen species damage to DNA; hence, the risk of UCC increases with increased episodes and severity of inflammatory flares.Patients with UCC are usually younger and have multifocal disease compared with patients with sporadic colon cancer.2,6 One study demonstrated that the stage on final pathology after surgical resection was similar for both groups with similar 5-year survival rates for stage I, II, and IV.6 The patients with UCC had a worse prognosis with stage III disease, with a 5-year survival rate of 43.3% compared with 57.4% (P = .03).6",Surgery,"A 25-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) presented to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain.
