Biopsy of the infraorbital nerve revealed squamous cell carcinoma, thought to have originated from a cutaneous source given his history. Immunotherapy was initiated with cemiplimab. MRI findings have remained stable over the past 2 years with no progression of disease or worsening symptoms.Same magnetic resonance image as in Figure 1B with an arrowhead denoting asymmetric enhancement of the right maxillary nerve in the foramen rotundum.The onset of multiple cranial neuropathies presents a diagnostic dilemma. Oncological diagnosis is often difficult in the absence of an obvious lesion and normal or equivocal imaging.1 This can lead to diagnostic delays and worse outcomes. This patient was seen by 20 different physicians over 5 years, including general, autonomic, and neuromuscular neurologists and neuro-ophthalmologists, before a diagnosis of malignancy was made. It can take time for perineural invasion (PNI) to become radiographically apparent, and a high index of suspicion for underlying malignancy must be maintained even with initially negative imaging.Primary leptomeningeal lymphoma (A) is a rare manifestation of primary central nervous system lymphoma that can present with multiple cranial neuropathies.2 CSF results are usually abnormal and progression of symptoms more rapid.2 Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (B) can present with painful ophthalmoplegia and multiple cranial neuropathies; however, steroids are typically effective.3 When located along the sphenoid wing, meningiomas (D) can cause multiple progressive cranial neuropathies.4 Typically visible on MRI as extra-axial homogenously enhancing masses,4 no such lesion was observed here. In this patient, the symptomatology, history, and radiographic findings are best explained by PNI of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), which a biopsy confirmed.One of the most common cancers in the world, cSCC occurs frequently in the head and neck secondary to sun exposure.5 PNI refers to the process of tumor spread into nerves and the space surrounding them.6 An estimated 2% to 6% of patients with cSCC of the head and neck will have PNI.1,6 Cranial nerves V and VII are most commonly involved given their extensive anatomical distributions.1,5,6 Clinically or radiographically apparent PNI confers a poor prognosis with a reported 5-year absolute survival rate of 50%.5Treatment for cSCC of the head and neck includes surgery (if resectable) and high-dose radiotherapy and systemic therapy as appropriate. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition is being used with increasing frequency and notable effectiveness.5-9 Early-phase studies demonstrated impressive response rates near 50% for advanced, unresectable, and metastatic cSCC of the head and neck, earning US Food and Drug Administration approval for 2 checkpoint inhibitors in this setting.7,8 Recently, a landmark phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant cemiplimab for stage II through IV (M0) cSCC before surgery was published, with 51% complete pathological response rates and 68% objective response rates on imaging.9 Similarly, in a recent report of 11 patients with cSCC of the head and neck with clinical PNI treated with checkpoint inhibitors, radiographic disease control was observed in 9 of 11 patients at extended follow-up.5 Many of these responses are durable and curative.The presence of both CN V and VII symptoms in a patient with a history of head and neck cSCC should raise suspicion for perineural recurrence of disease. While initial MRI may be negative, radiographic manifestation of PNI often occurs over time as the disease progresses and symptoms worsen. Expert review by a neuroradiologist can be helpful in identifying this finding earlier in the disease course. Mounting evidence suggests that immunotherapy is a promising treatment option for this population and should be considered as first-line therapy.",Neurology,"A 68-year-old man presented with progressive right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Moyamoya disease with renovascular hypertension,Atherosclerotic disease,Fibromuscular dysplasia,Takayasu arteritis,D. Takayasu arteritis,D,Takayasu arteritis,"The correct diagnosis is Takayasu arteritis. Takayasu arteritis is a chronic granulomatous vasculitis that affects the tunica media of medium/large arteries and produces narrowing, stenosis, and aneurysmal dilatation of aorta and its branches.1 In this patient, narrowing of whole length of the renal artery from its origin, involvement of ostia, and thickening of the wall of aorta favored the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis. Atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia are the common causes of renovascular hypertension in adults and children, respectively.2 Atherosclerosis is characterized by presence of atheroma at the bifurcation of the renal artery and abdominal aorta. Absence of atheroma at origin of the renal artery and narrowing of its whole length is against atherosclerosis. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory vascular disease that mainly affects coronary and renal arteries. It rarely affects the aorta and involves the distal part of the renal artery and spares ostia.3 Moyamoya disease is a nonatherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease that presents with supraclinoid stenosis of internal carotid arteries and produces extensive collaterals. Children present with moyamoya disease with cerebral ischemic events whereas adults may present with cerebral ischemia or intracerebral hemorrhage. Moyamoya disease may present with renovascular hypertension in 5% to 8% children and 28.8% in adults.4 Moyamoya disease affects one-third of the length of the main renal artery and spares the ostia and rarely involves aorta.5Takayasu arteritis is rarely associated with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. It presents with an early systemic phase characterized by malaise, myalgia, weight loss, and fever, and the late vaso-occlusive phase that manifests with stroke, syncope, limb claudication, pulselessness, hypertension, and vascular bruit. Early systemic manifestations are usually missed in children. Headache, cardiomyopathy, kidney failure, and systolic hypertension are significantly more common in children compared with adults.1 The markers of inflammation-like raised C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, β-2-microglobulin, haptoglobin, and orosomucoid are elevated. However, there are not diagnostic of Takayasu arteritis.1 Takayasu arteritis should be suspected in any child that presents with hypertension or its complications. Diagnosis is usually based on presence of hypertension, pulse deficit or claudication, blood pressure discrepancies in limbs, bruits, and angiographic abnormalities. The updated consensus criteria for diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis requires angiographic abnormality (aneurysm/dilatation, narrowing, occlusion, or thickened arterial wall) of the aorta or its main branches, coronaries, or pulmonary arteries not because of fibromuscular dysplasia or similar causes.6 Differential diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis includes giant-cell arteritis that involves large vessels in adults, medium-sized vasculitis with cross-symptomatology, like Kawasaki disease that involves coronaries, polyarteritis nodosa with mesenteric, and kidney involvement and systemic lupus erythematosus. The treatment of Takayasu arteritis includes control of hypertension, oral glucocorticoids, and immunosuppressants to control the disease activity, aspirin, and specific treatment of vaso-occlusive disease. This child showed recovery from headache and adequate control of hypertension while receiving amlodipine and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. He was given oral corticosteroids and not offered kidney angioplasty due to poor function of the right kidney on diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scan.Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is rare in children, mostly seen in the setting of acute lymphocytic leukemia during the induction phase of chemotherapy or rarely during hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. Cerebral autodysregulation due to hypertension produces vasodilatation and widening of endothelial tight junctions that produces vasogenic edema, predominantly in the occipital region due to relative lack of sympathetic fibers around arteries of posterior circulation. Headaches, seizures, and altered mental status are the main clinical features.7Takayasu arteritis frequently presents with hypertension in children, which makes it an ideal setting for the development of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.",Neurology,"A 6-year child presented with headache for 1 month and seizures followed by altered consciousness for 1 day.

Multiple pustules on the hand accompanying C1/C2 spondylitis and spondylodiscitis and tenderness in the right sternoclavicular articulation reminded us of suspicion of synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome. A whole-body bone scintigraphy was ordered, revealing the classic bull head sign with increased tracer uptake in bilateral sternoclavicular joints and the sternal angle (Figure 2), which is highly specific for SAPHO syndrome.3Whole-body bone scintigraphy showed increased tracer uptake in bilateral sternoclavicular joints, the sternal angle (bull head sign), and cervical vertebral bodies.First described by Chamot et al,4 SAPHO syndrome is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by dermatological and osteoarticular symptoms. Infectious, genetic susceptibility, immunological, and environmental factors may play a role in the development of the disease. Propionibacterium acnes antigen has been only occasionally found in bacterial cultures. An association between CSF2RA, NOD2, MEGF6, and ADAM5 genes and the predisposition of SAPHO syndrome has been established.5 Elevated serum IgG4 and some cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL) 6, IL-8, IL-18, IL-23 and endothelin-1, have been described in patients with SAPHO syndrome.6 In laboratory tests, and features of an active inflammatory process (accelerated ESR, elevated CRP) are observed.7The diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome is based on fulfilling at least 1 of the criteria described by Kahn and Kahn,8 which include (1) chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, usually sterile, spine may be involved, with or without skin lesions, (2) acute, subacute, or chronic arthritis associated with any of the following: palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), pustular psoriasis, or severe acne, and (3) any sterile osteitis associated with any of the following: PPP, pustular psoriasis, psoriasis vulgaris, or severe acne. Sternocostoclavicular osteitis and hyperostosis, spondyloarthritis with hyperostosis, and PPP are the most common triad of the disease occurring in adults.9 As the osteoarticular and skin manifestations often do not occur simultaneously, the diagnosis can be difficult.As the cause is unknown, no consensus has been reached on the treatment of SAPHO syndrome. The primary goal of treatment is the improvement of clinical symptoms, thereby improving patients’ quality of life in the long term. Current treatment options for SAPHO syndrome include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and biologics.10After oral etoricoxib and prednisolone treatment, neck pain and pustules gradually subsided and ESR and CRP decreased. The patient has remained clinically stable at 6-month follow-up.

A diagnosis was made of sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy (SLONM) associated with monoclonal gammopathy. The patient received a 6-month trial of intravenous immunoglobulin without clinical improvement. He has subsequently been referred for hematological evaluation and potential autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.Electron micrograph (original magnification ×8200) demonstrating the presence of nemaline rods in a subsarcolemmal position along the periphery of a muscle fiber (white arrowhead).SLONM is a rare, acquired, adult-onset progressive myopathy first described by A. G. Engel in 1966.1 The typical clinical phenotype is characterized by weakness and atrophy of predominantly proximal and axial muscles, which may lead to camptocormia or head drop. Dysphagia and dyspnea are common, occurring in approximately 50% of cases,2 with respiratory failure a common cause of death.3 Cardiac involvement is reported, manifesting as conduction abnormalities and/or cardiomyopathy.2,4Creatine kinase levels are typically normal or mildly elevated, while electromyography shows myopathic motor units and fibrillation potentials.3 Magnetic resonance imaging may show preferential involvement of the neck extensors, paraspinal, gluteal, hamstring, and soleus muscles.4 The distinctive pathological hallmark of SLONM is the visualization of nemaline rods in myofibers on light or electron microscopy. Associated histopathological findings include myofiber atrophy, myofibrillar disintegration, corelike areas, vacuolar changes, fiber necrosis, inflammatory infiltrates, and mitochondrial changes.2 Importantly, initial muscle biopsy may be nondiagnostic in up to one-third of SLONM cases, necessitating a second muscle biopsy when clinical suspicion is high.5Key paraclinical associations of late-onset nemaline myopathy include monoclonal gammopathy and HIV infection. Monoclonal gammopathy is present in approximately 50% of SLONM cases and typically comprises an IgG paraprotein with either κ or λ light chains. Multiple myeloma is rare.2 It is important to note that late-onset nemaline myopathy is clinically and pathologically distinct from the congenital nemaline myopathies, although rare cases of adult-onset familial nemaline myopathy have been reported.6 As such, genetic testing should be considered in the presence of family history or if atypical features are present.The natural history of SLONM is progressive weakness leading to death usually within 1 to 5 years from symptom onset. There is conflicting evidence as to whether the presence of monoclonal gammopathy is associated with worse prognosis.3,5 SLONM, particularly when associated with monoclonal gammopathy, appears to be poorly responsive to immunotherapies.2,3 Nevertheless, some patients with SLONM demonstrate marked and sustained response to intravenous immunoglobulin, which has therefore been suggested as a first-line therapy.5 For patients who do not respond to immunotherapy, or for those with a more aggressive disease course, chemotherapy-based treatments with or without autologous stem cell transplantation have been shown to achieve higher rates of neurological improvement, complete remission, and overall survival.7,8",Neurology,"A 72-year-old man presented with mild proximal weakness developing into progressive camptocormia, head drop, and prominent dysphagia over a 2-year period.

Oculomotor findings include fixation instability and frequent square-wave jerks, while gaze-evoked nystagmus is less common.1 Common systemic manifestations include cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and musculoskeletal abnormalities like scoliosis, pes cavus, foot inversion, and hammertoes.2 Late-onset cases commonly present with spastic ataxia with preserved or even brisk reflexes, without systemic manifestations.2 Brain MRI in patients with FRDA shows spinal cord atrophy with preserved cerebellar volume.1 This patient had sensory neuronopathy and skeletal deformities in the feet. However, disease onset was in the fourth decade of life with absent reflexes, prominent gaze evoked nystagmus, slow saccades, gaze palsy, and diffuse cerebellar atrophy on MRI. Test results for FRDA genetics were negative.Fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS; choice B) is an X-linked disease seen in premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) carriers of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Late-onset (older than 50 years) intention/action tremor and cerebellar ataxia are the core clinical manifestations of FXTAS. Cognitive dysfunction (eg, frontal subcortical dementia with predominant executive dysfunction), psychiatric problems (eg, anxiety, depression, and social avoidance), and parkinsonism are commonly associated.3 Slow vertical saccade and impaired vertical optokinetic nystagmus can give rise to progressive supranuclear palsy phenotype.4 Sensory axonal neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction can precede the motor symptoms. Manifestations are generally mild in female individuals. However, migraine, thyroid dysfunction, and fibromyalgia are more common comorbidities in female carriers.5 Bilateral T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities of the middle cerebellar peduncles (middle cerebellar peduncles sign), diffuse cortical-cerebellar atrophy, and hyperintensities involving periventricular, splenial, and pontocerebellar regions are classic radiological features of FXTAS.3,5 This patient was female and had anxiety, cerebellar ataxia, slow saccades, and hyperintensities involving middle cerebellar peduncles and cerebellum. FXTAS genetic test results were negative.Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC; choice C) is an autosomal recessive neurovisceral lysosomal lipid storage disorder caused by mutation in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes. Cerebellar ataxia, dystonia, and chorea are common movement disorders in adult-onset NPC, along with vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and predominant downgaze restriction.6 The age at onset can vary from the perinatal period to adults older than 50 years. Visceral involvement in the form of hepatosplenomegaly commonly precedes neurological manifestations. Psychosis, behavioral symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction are common and can remain as an isolated presentation in adult-onset NPC for several years.6 Seizure and cataplexy are more frequent in late-infantile and juvenile forms. Demyelinating peripheral neuropathy can be associated with childhood-onset forms but are rare in adult-onset NPC. Brain MRI is mostly normal or can show cerebellar, frontal, and midbrain atrophy with disease progression. This patient had generalized anxiety disorder and mild cognitive impairment. No history of seizure was noted. There was no organomegaly, and gaze palsy was not supranuclear. NPC genetic test results were negative for this patient.In a clinical setting of undiagnosed slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, mitochondrial etiology (choice D) should not be missed. Presence of ophthalmoplegia, peripheral neuropathy, deafness, retinitis pigmentosa, and history of seizure aid in the diagnosis. Mitochondrial syndromic disorders that can present with cerebellar ataxia are summarized in the Table.7 Among them, mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG)–mediated disorders are the most common cause of mitochondrial ataxia. Sensory predominant axonal neuropathy, areflexia, and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia are the most commonly associated nonataxic features.8,9 Dystonia, chorea, myoclonus, ptosis, myopathy, cognitive impairment, and seizures can be associated.10 Brain MRI shows T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities predominantly involving cerebellar white matter, middle cerebellar peduncles, and thalamus, while brain stem and occipital frontal white matter involvement can also be seen.8 If POLG-mediated ataxia is suspected clinically and radiologically, the most appropriate next step would be either direct sequence analysis of the POLG gene or next-generation sequencing panel for ataxia where POLG is included. Mitochondrial genetic panel analysis for this patient revealed compound heterozygous pathogenic mutation in the POLG gene (choice D), c.2243 G>C (p.W748S) in one allele and c.1399 G>A (p.A467T) in the other allele. This case highlights the value of screening for mitochondrial etiology when facing adult-onset slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia of unknown etiology.",Neurology,"A 55-year-old female patient with a history of hypercholesterolemia and anxiety was referred for progressive imbalance while walking and intense fear of falling for the past 14 years. The patient had become progressively disabled and had been using a wheelchair for 4 years prior to presentation. Neurological examination showed gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus in both directions along with slow saccades and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes. There was ataxic dysarthria. Tone was normal in all 4 limbs but stretch reflexes were absent and plantar fascia were mute. Limb power was normal. Ataxia was seen on finger-to-nose and heel-knee-shin tests. Chorea was present in both legs. Ankle inversion with bilateral hammertoes was noted. Electromyography revealed sensory neuronopathy. On brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffuse cerebellar atrophy was noted along with T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus (Figure).

Neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve,D,Neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve,"Further detailed MRI constructive interference in steady-state sequence with fine cuts of the midbrain was performed, which revealed that the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and left superior cerebellar artery (SCA) were indenting the oculomotor nerve with resultant displacement (Figure 2). No intracranial aneurysms were demonstrated.A, The axial cut shows the neurovascular conflict of the left posterior cerebral artery (yellow arrowhead) and left oculomotor nerve (white arrowhead). B, The sagittal cut demonstrates the neurovascular conflict between the left posterior cerebral artery (yellow arrowhead) and left superior cerebellar artery (blue arrowhead) with the left oculomotor nerve (white arrowhead), resulting in its displacement.An oculomotor nerve palsy with pupil involvement is often due to extrinsic compression by posterior communicating artery (PCoA) aneurysms.1 This is because when the nerve exits the midbrain, its cisternal course2 passes between the PCA and SCA and is accompanied by the PCoA before running in an anteromedial-lateral direction to reach the cavernous sinus. The dilated pupil occurs as external compression affects the pial vessels, which then compromise the parasympathetic fibers and results in paralysis of the sphincter pupillae.Compared with the more familiar neurovascular compression syndromes of trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasms,3 nonaneurysmal neurovascular conflict causing oculomotor nerve palsy is not common.4 However, high-resolution thin-sliced MRI has been found to be increasingly accurate in identifying and correlating symptoms with the extent of neurovascular compression,5 and thus should remain a differential diagnosis.6 This is of clinical significance, as cases with extensive negative workup are often labeled as idiopathic or attributed to microvascular causes,7 which are conservatively managed with observation, whereas the treatment options of neurovascular conflict causing oculomotor nerve palsy ranges from the use of steroids to microvascular decompression.8In this patient, in view of his significant symptoms with chronic persistent presentation, he underwent microvascular decompression  with significant improvement of the ptosis and ophthalmoparesis. This case emphasizes the importance of high-resolution MRI to look for neurovascular conflict in oculomotor nerve palsy with pupillary involvement, especially when no other cause has been found.",Neurology,"A 37-year-old Asian nonsmoking man with no known medical or drug history presented with an insidious onset of left-eye ptosis (only brought to attention by his friends on review of recent photographs) and subsequent painless vertical diplopia for 1 year.

Six months prior, he found his palms could not make full contact with each other (the “prayer sign”). He had not been able to fully clench his fists for 2 months or squat for the past 10 days. No erythema, edema, or sclerotic skin plaque had been found on his limbs or trunk. No Raynaud phenomenon had occurred. His medical and family histories were unremarkable. On examination, he showed bilateral limited mobility of interphalangeal (hands), metacarpophalangeal, wrist, interphalangeal (feet), metatarsophalangeal, and ankle joints (Video). No muscular atrophy or sclerodactyly was found. The prayer sign (Figure 1A) and the “groove sign” (Figure 1B) were observed. Blood test results indicated eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count, 1300 μL; reference, <500μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 31 mm/h; reference, <15 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 3.01 mg/dL; reference, <0.8 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]).

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Myotonic dystrophy,Systemic sclerosis,Deep morphea (morphea profunda),Eosinophilic fasciitis,D. Eosinophilic fasciitis,D,Eosinophilic fasciitis,"Insidious onset of bilaterally limited joint mobility is infrequently seen by neurologists. EMG showed electrical myotonia, reminiscent of myotonic dystrophy (choice A).1 However, myotonic dystrophy is characterized by abnormally slow or delayed muscle relaxation following a normal muscle contraction,1 which was absent in this patient. Limited joint mobility and the prayer sign can be seen in systemic sclerosis (choice B).2 However, the negative ANA test results and the absence of Raynaud phenomenon, sclerodactyly, and internal organ involvement helped exclude systemic sclerosis.3 Limited mobility of joints, peripheral eosinophilia, and increased ESR and CRP can be found in deep morphea (choice C), a rare subtype of morphea that primarily involves the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue and may extend to underlying fascia and muscle.4 Nevertheless, the symmetrical distribution of joint involvement, histology displaying preferential fascial inflammation (Figure 2), and the absence of sclerotic skin plaque in this patient point to the diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) over deep morphea.Inflammatory cell infiltrate composed primarily of lymphocytes and eosinophils (arrowheads) in the fascia (hematoxylin and eosin stain).EF is a rare disorder characterized by the induration of fascia and skin, preceded by the abrupt onset of erythema and nonpitting edema, resulting in limited mobility of the underlying joints.3 The disease can have an insidious onset.5 The appearance of orange peel caused by skin induration and the groove sign, which is probably due to the relative sparing of the epidermis and superficial dermis by the fibrotic process, are typical signs of established EF.3 Occasionally, EF can present without skin involvement.6,7 Sclerodactyly and Raynaud phenomenon are usually absent. Laboratory findings of EF include peripheral eosinophilia, increased ESR and CRP level, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and negative ANA test results.3 The results of biopsy containing skin, fascia, and muscle conducted at the left gastrocnemius of this patient showed inflammatory cell infiltrate mainly in the fascia (composed primarily of lymphocytes and eosinophils) (Figure 2) and some subjacent endomysium and perimysium, but they were minimal in the skin. There were moderate variations in muscle fiber size. Some muscle fibers were atrophic. A scatter of necrotic muscle fibers was seen. The myositis, which is frequently observed in EF, may explain the EMG findings in this patient, as myotonic discharges may be seen in a number of acquired myopathic disorders, including myositis.1 Also, certain drugs (eg, statins) can cause myotonic discharges.1 The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of EF.The etiology and exact incidence of EF remain unknown. A variety of etiological factors have been proposed, such as strenuous exercise or trauma preceding disease onset.8 To our knowledge, no randomized trials have evaluated therapies for EF. Usually, treatment is started with systemic glucocorticoids at doses equivalent to prednisone, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day.8 Concomitant immunosuppressants (eg, methotrexate) are used by some practitioners as the initial therapy or when patients are steroid resistant or refractory.8,9 For this patient, prednisone and cyclophosphamide were prescribed. Nine months later, his joint mobility was improved. Diagnosing EF is challenging because of its rarity. Bilaterally limited mobility of joints, cutaneous manifestations (eg, groove sign and orange peel appearance), and peripheral eosinophilia are useful clues to the diagnosis of EF.",Neurology,"A 31-year-old man with insidious onset of limited mobility of joints visited our clinic for evaluation.

Giant cell arteritis,A,Giant cell arteritis,"Facial and extraocular muscles are typically spared by the myositis associated with aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase antibodies, and the lack of other features of antisynthetase syndrome (interstitial lung disease, nonerosive arthritis, Raynaud phenomenon) makes this diagnosis less likely. Immunoglobulin G4–related disease can cause enlargement of the extraocular muscles, creating a restrictive pattern of motility but may also be accompanied by hypertrophic pachymeningitis and sclerosing lesions of the abdomen and lungs. Lastly, although the history of transient contralateral ptosis may be reminiscent of myasthenia gravis, the lack of fatiguability, normal ice-pack test results, and soft tissue changes on magnetic resonance imaging suggest an alternate etiology.Temporal artery biopsy was obtained demonstrating intimal hyperplasia and transmural inflammation with giant cells (Figure 2), consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is classically thought to affect large and medium-sized arteries, although recent definitions reflect the capacity of GCA to affect vessels of any size.1 Most patients with ocular GCA present with acute vision loss, with 80% attributable to arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy owing to ischemia of the posterior ciliary arteries.2Histopathologic photograph of a temporal artery biopsy specimen. High-power image (original magnification ×200) shows granulomatous inflammation with giant cells (asterisk), transmural inflammation, intimal hyperplasia, and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina (arrowheads) with elastic Verhoeff–Van Gieson stain.Case series of GCA have demonstrated that although approximately 5% to 15% of patients report diplopia, only a subset have demonstrable oculomotor deficits on presentation, suggesting that ophthalmoplegia may be transient and underreported.2-4 There are 2 proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms for ophthalmoplegia in GCA. The first is arteritic involvement of the vasa nervorum of the ocular motor nerves. However, ocular motility deficits in GCA often do not conform to the pattern of a cranial nerve. The second is arteritis of the vascular supply of the extraocular muscles. Despite the rich anastomotic vasculature from both the ophthalmic artery and branches of the external carotid artery, ischemia of the extraocular muscles has been observed. A histopathologic survey of the entire ocular motor apparatus in a case of GCA with severe ophthalmoparesis demonstrated extraocular muscle ischemia with preservation of cranial nerves 3, 4, and 6 along their entire course from the nerve nuclei to the orbits.5Ptosis associated with ophthalmoplegia in GCA may be attributable to similar mechanisms.4 Ptosis has also been reported in relation to Horner syndrome secondary to vasculitis affecting the vasa nervorum supplying the sympathetic plexus or direct granulomatous involvement of the sympathetic nerve fibers as they run alongside the inflamed vessel wall of the cavernous internal carotid artery.6,7This patient had ocular motility deficits and ptosis that did not conform to the pattern of the ocular motor nerves and had no other signs of Horner syndrome. There was no ataxia or hemiparesis on examination, and magnetic resonance imaging ruled out a brainstem infarct. Her presentation was most suggestive of vasculitis leading to ischemia of the periorbital musculature. The patient promptly received high-dose intravenous steroids, which led to symptomatic improvement within hours.This case demonstrates the multifaceted presentation of GCA and the importance of maintaining a high suspicion in patients with elevated inflammatory markers, headache, and uncommon neuro-ophthalmic symptoms. When ocular motility abnormalities do not correspond to a typical ocular motor nerve palsy, ischemic myopathy should be considered, and prompt treatment with corticosteroids should be initiated to prevent vision loss and complications from GCA.",Neurology,"A 75-year-old woman presented with horizontal binocular diplopia, right-sided ptosis, and a new headache that was progressive over 3 days.

After recovering from anesthesia in the postanesthesia care unit, he experienced headache, facial numbness, inability to open both his eyes, and inability to move both eyes in any direction.He had a known enhancing central skull base lesion in sella turcica with compression of the optic chiasm and mild mass effect on the pons that was felt to be a pituitary macroadenoma (Figure). His baseline examination before the cystectomy showed visual acuity of 20/20 OU with intact extraocular movements and unremarkable confrontational fields, although a mild bitemporal hemianopia was seen on automated visual fields.T1-weighted coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast shows a 4.9 × 4.6 × 5.2-cm sellar/parasellar lobulated mass with homogenous enhancement before symptom onset (A), which became 5.3 × 5.1 × 5.3 cm and had loss of enhancement after symptom onset (B). The mass caused superior displacement of the optic chiasm and had extension into the cavernous sinus bilaterally. The mass also extended posteriorly and deformed the anterior aspect of the pons (not shown). After symptom onset, the mass was hyperintense on T2-weighted images (not shown).During the bedside examination in the postanesthesia care unit, he was noted to have complete bilateral ptosis. His visual acuity was 20/20 OU with full visual fields on confrontational visual field testing. He had decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick in the V1/V2 distribution of the trigeminal nerve bilaterally. The right and left pupils were 5 mm and 6 mm in size, respectively, in both light and dark. There was no pupillary response to light or accommodation. No exophthalmos was noted. Intraocular pressure was normal in both eyes. The patient was unable to move either eye in any direction on extraocular motility testing. Vestibulo-ocular reflex did not overcome the ophthalmoplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained 12 hours after symptom onset redemonstrating the large sellar mass, which no longer had central enhancement (Figure). What Is Your Diagnosis?",Orbital compartment syndrome,Ocular motor apraxia,Pituitary apoplexy,Cavernous sinus thrombosis,C. Pituitary apoplexy,C,Pituitary apoplexy,"Based on the acute presentation of symptoms and signs starting immediately after surgery and change in the appearance of tumor on MRI (loss of central enhancement), a diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy was made. The ophthalmoplegia in ocular motor apraxia can be overcome with vestibular ocular reflex, which was not the case here. The absence of exophthalmos and normal intraocular pressure argue against the diagnosis of orbital compartment syndrome. Imaging does not support the diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis.Pituitary apoplexy is an acute-onset syndrome due to hemorrhaging and/or infarction of the pituitary gland. Postoperative pituitary apoplexy has been reported after cardiac surgery, abdominal surgery, thyroidectomy, laparoscopic lumbar spinal fusion, and knee arthroplasty.1 Risk factors proposed during surgery that could lead to pituitary apoplexy include prolonged mechanical ventilation, embolization, unstable blood pressure, anticoagulation, crystalloid hemodilution, previous treatment with dopamine agonists, and radiotherapy.2Patients with pituitary apoplexy typically present with headaches. Cranial nerve palsies leading to ophthalmoplegia have been reported in about 50% of patients during pituitary apoplexy.1 Sixty-four percent of patients can have vision loss from worsening chiasmal compression, which fortunately this patient did not have.3 Early neuroimaging study is important to confirm the suspicion of pituitary apoplexy, along with urgent pituitary function tests. Computed tomography scan is often the first study performed in an acute setting and may demonstrate a variably hyperdense mass of the sella and suprasellar region in the presence of hemorrhage. MRI is the preferred study of choice with sensitivity of about 90%.4 Appearance of hemorrhagic pituitary apoplexy on MRI depends on the sequence and stage of hemorrhage. In the acute phase, hemorrhage is usually hypotense on T2-weighted imaging because of the presence of deoxyhemoglobin, which was not present in the present patient. Infarctive pituitary apoplexy alone, which is a rarer presentation of pituitary apoplexy, has low signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted sequences and no contrast enhancement of the tumor as seen in this patient. It may have associated rim enhancement.5Pituitary apoplexy is a vision- and life-threatening neuro-ophthalmic emergency. Before the use of corticosteroids, mortality rates were reported to be as high as 50% because of acute adrenal insufficiency that many of these patients develop. Treatment involves urgent administration of steroids, endocrine evaluation, and urgent surgical intervention for prompt decompression based on severity of presentation.Visual recovery, with or without sequelae, is variable depending on the severity and duration of compression of the optic nerve apparatus. Ophthalmoplegia resolves in the majority of patients, but some patients can have incomplete recovery.6,7The patient immediately started receiving intravenous corticosteroids under the guidance of endocrinology and neurosurgery. He was monitored for any endocrine deficiencies while inpatient. After no improvement in extraocular movements were noted over 5 days, the patient underwent transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumor. Pathological evaluation of the tumor confirmed a pituitary adenoma with areas of necrosis consistent with pituitary apoplexy.Postoperative MRI showed successful resection of the large pituitary macroadenoma, with decompression of the optic chiasm. There was some residual tumor in the bilateral cavernous sinuses, basisphenoid, and along the dorsum sella.One year after surgery, the patient’s visual acuity was 20/20 OU with normal color vision. Bilateral ptosis had resolved. Extraocular movements were full and the eyes were well aligned. However, the pupils remained unresponsive to light and accommodation.

The mass caused superior displacement of the optic chiasm and had extension into the cavernous sinus bilaterally. The mass also extended posteriorly and deformed the anterior aspect of the pons (not shown). After symptom onset, the mass was hyperintense on T2-weighted images (not shown).During the bedside examination in the postanesthesia care unit, he was noted to have complete bilateral ptosis. His visual acuity was 20/20 OU with full visual fields on confrontational visual field testing. He had decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick in the V1/V2 distribution of the trigeminal nerve bilaterally. The right and left pupils were 5 mm and 6 mm in size, respectively, in both light and dark. There was no pupillary response to light or accommodation. No exophthalmos was noted. Intraocular pressure was normal in both eyes. The patient was unable to move either eye in any direction on extraocular motility testing. Vestibulo-ocular reflex did not overcome the ophthalmoplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained 12 hours after symptom onset redemonstrating the large sellar mass, which no longer had central enhancement (Figure).",what is your diagnosis?,What is your diagnosis?,Pituitary apoplexy,Orbital compartment syndrome,Ocular motor apraxia,Cavernous sinus thrombosis,A,1,1,1,1,male,0,0,50.0,41-50,,159,original,gender,True,original

Autosomal recessive parkinsonism,C,Autosomal recessive parkinsonism,"In patients with relative subacute onset of cognitive decline and movement disorders, treatable causes must be ruled out. In this patient, central nervous system infection was unlikely owing to normal laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing. Paraneoplastic antibody screening was negative, with no malignancies on total-body PET. Newer antibodies against the glycine receptor (GlyR) and immunoglobulinlike cell adhesion molecule 5 (IgLON5) have been discovered that mimic atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Anti-GlyR antibodies are typically associated with stiff-person syndromes or progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Patients with IgLON5 antibodies develop a sleep disorder with parasomnia and/or breathing difficulty with bulbar symptoms, gait abnormalities, oculomotor problems, chorea, and cognitive decline.Although untreatable, the patient’s symptoms, disease course, and abnormal electroencephalogram could indicate Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, but one would expect MRI changes and 14-3-3 protein. Symmetrical parkinsonism, poor levodopa response, early falls, rapid cognitive decline, and brain hypometabolism may raise the suspicion of a tauopathy, eg, progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal degeneration. However, preserved vertical gaze, presence of rapid eye movement–sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and very early onset of symptoms are atypical, and tauopathies were ruled out after brain biopsy. The history of cataracts, hearing loss, osteoarthritis, and hyperlipidemia, made us consider mitochondrial diseases, but screening (eg, mitochondrial DNA testing) was negative.Typical nonmotor features (RBD, restless legs syndrome, visual daytime hallucinations) are a strong indicator for an α-synucleinopathy. This was confirmed by the histopathological finding of Lewy bodies (Figure 2). In patients with early-onset parkinsonism (<50 years), genetic variants should be considered, even with a negative family history. Genetic screening in this patient revealed a novel homozygous variant (c.189dupA [p. Glu64Argfs*5]) within the DJ-1 protein of the PARK7 gene, confirming autosomal-recessive parkinsonism.Immunohistochemistry with silver staining demonstrated scattered globular inclusions and neurites consistent with Lewy bodies and Lewy neuritis (original magnification ×400).PARK7 is one of the rare causative genes for early-onset Parkinson disease (frequency of 1%-2%).1 The DJ-1 protein is expressed in almost all cells (eg, neurons and glial cells) and protects against oxidative stress by various mechanisms.2 In vitro studies have shown that DJ-1 functions as a chaperone protein, modulating α-synuclein oligomerization and cytotoxicity. Absence of DJ-1 in PARK7 gene variants causes a dysregulation in the brain, resulting in misfolding and aggregation.3 The increased prevalence of mitochondrial features in patients with Lewy body pathology highlights the role of PARK7 gene variants in mitochondrial homeostasis.4 Although the exact mechanism is still unclear, in vivo studies have shown that DJ-1 specifically acts on mitochondrial complex I, resulting in oxidative stress resistance.5Typically, patients with PARK7 gene variants have phenotypes similar to idiopathic Parkinson disease, although more complex syndromes with features of anterior horn cell disorders have been described. A recent literature review suggests that a triad of early-onset Parkinson disease, cataracts, and sensorineural hearing loss may be specific for DJ-1/PARK7; however, the phenotypic spectrum is still expanding.6This patient’s motor and cognitive decline have gradually progressed, and he required a wheelchair at age 46 years (<5 years after symptom onset). In this period, he was again given levodopa/benserazide (maximum 200 mg/50 mg given 3 times daily) and a dopamine agonist (rotigotine patch, maximum 6 mg/24 hours); both were not beneficial and were discontinued.

Neuroschistosomiasis,B,Neuroschistosomiasis,"Although listeriosis is a major cause of rhombencephalitis, the CSF typically does not show eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, and the patient’s blood and CSF cultures were sterile. Beyond listeriosis, other infections (herpesvirus infections and tuberculosis) and autoimmune diseases (Behçet disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, demyelinating diseases, and paraneoplastic syndromes) may cause rhombencephalitis.1 The patient presented with a nodular lesion with an heterogenous, multinodular, contrast-enhancing pattern consistent with a granulomatous disease (eg, infection by mycobacteria, fungi, parasite, or even sarcoidosis).2,3The differential diagnosis is narrowed largely by the CSF characteristics. Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis is defined as the presence of more than 10 eosinophils/mm3 in CSF and/or eosinophils accounting for more than 10% of cerebrospinal leukocytes.4 The most common cause of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis is invasion of the central nervous system by helminthic parasites, such as Angiostrongylus cantonensis, Gnathostoma species, Schistosoma mansoni, and Taenia solium.5 Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis may present eosinophilia and neuromyelitis-optica spectrum disorders may present some eosinophils in the CSF, but we would not expect sufficient eosinophils to fulfill the definition of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in these diseases.With the history of recent travel to northeastern Brazil, an endemic region for S mansoni, we ordered immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibody tests for this parasite in the patient’s CSF, of which results were positive. We also tested for antibodies in the blood using the enzyme-linked immunoassay  method, of which results were undetermined. Different from antibodies in the CSF, antibody detection in blood samples cannot distinguish between prior and active infection and have limited specificity for the diagnosis of neuroschistomiasis in endemic areas.6Results for Kato-Katz testing for S mansoni eggs were negative. However, this test has low sensitivity, especially when a single sample is used because egg burden in feces may be uneven and may lack sensitivity in the acute phase of infection because it may take up to 2 months for the adult worms to deposit the eggs in the bowel wall.7We believe the present patient fulfills the diagnosis of neuroschistosomiasis according to criteria proposed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention8: (1) typical syndrome as eosinophilic meningoencephalitis is suggestive of an infection caused by helminths, including schistosomiasis, (2) evidence of schistosomiasis demonstrated by the presence of positive immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G  antibodies for S mansoni in the CSF, and (3) a reasonable exclusion of the differential diagnosis.Neuroschistosomiasis can develop during any stage of the infection by S mansoni. However, an intense granulomatous response with clinically significant eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, eosinophilia, patchy pulmonary infiltrates, the presence of immunoglobulin M antibodies in the CSF, the absence of eggs in the Kato-Katz testing, and the presumed exposure are all suggestive of the acute phase of the infection that usually occurs 28 to 90 days after the infection and precedes oviposition.6In Brazil, the most common presentation of neuroschistosomiasis is myeloradiculopathy owing to the parasite migration via the Batson venous plexus. However, case reports and a systematic review of 33 cases published from 1989 to 2019 of cerebral infection with S mansoni showed that brainstem lesions can also occur.9There is a concern for initial worsening of neurologic symptoms with administration of anthelmintic therapy with praziquantel because the egg destruction may lead to further central nervous system inflammation. Although there is a lack of consensus on the optimal treatment of neuroschistosomiasis, many authors believe this complication can be prevented by corticosteroids, usually prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/d, started a few days before the initiation of praziquantel and continued for at least 2 months.10Even with adequate therapy for neuroschistosomiasis, this patient presented with severe dysphagia and was submitted to orotracheal intubation.

Malignant atrophic papulosis,A,Malignant atrophic papulosis,"The differential diagnoses to consider in a patient who has cutaneous papules and myelopathy can include infectious (eg, secondary syphilis, HIV), ischemic (eg, malignant atrophic papulosis), autoimmune (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet disease), and paraneoplastic (eg, scleromyxedema with paraproteinemia) causes.The diagnosis of malignant atrophic papulosis (MAP) or Köhlmeier-Degos disease was supported by the characteristic cutaneous eruption and histological findings of wedge-shaped dermal collagen degeneration, interstitial mucin deposition, small–vessel angiopathy with luminal thrombi, perivascular and perineural lymphocytic infiltration, and interface vacuolar alteration of the epidermis (Figure 2). These findings, indicative of microvascular injury, can also be seen in the setting of Degos-like diseases, namely dermatomyositis, lupus erythematosus, and scleroderma. Negative autoimmune markers and the absence of characteristic clinical features excluded these differential diagnoses. Scleromyxedema is an unusual condition of dermal mucin deposition and fibroblast proliferation and is typically associated with a monoclonal gammopathy and other systemic manifestations. Histopathological findings of microvascular injury in the patient are not consistent with this diagnosis. Lues maligna is a rare but severe form of secondary syphilis that has been described in patients who have HIV co-infection—cutaneous lesions start out as papules that ulcerate to become well-demarcated necrotic plaques. Syphilis was ruled out with negative findings on serum, cerebrospinal fluid treponemal, and nontreponemal antibody tests, and the absence of spirochetes on skin biopsy. The acute and stepwise deterioration of this patient’s thoracic myelopathy is consistent with a vascular event.Biopsy from the central atrophic scar of a skin papule, showing thinned epidermis with mild interface vacuolar dermatitis, papillary dermal fibrosis, and increased dermal mucin deposition. Inset shows a vascular deposit of C5b-C9 membranolytic attack complex on immunostaining (hematoxylin-eosin; original magnification x400).MAP is a thrombo-occlusive microangiopathy predominantly targeting the skin, gastrointestinal system, and central nervous system (CNS), with poorly understood pathogenesis. A seminal article found vascular C5b-9 and high expression of interferon-α in all skin, gastrointestinal, and CNS tissue samples, and concluded that a dysregulated interferon-α response in concert with membranolytic attack complex deposition contributed to unique vascular injuries.1 In the largest series of patients who had neurologic manifestations of MAP, fatal hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes and a disabling polyradiculoneuropathy were described.2 Vascular cord lesions have been less commonly reported, but patchy involvement of the entire transverse section of the cord may explain why clinically manifested lesions may not appear on imaging.3,4 The long-term prognosis of MAP is poor with a high mortality rate, most commonly from bowel perforation.5Expert opinion supports the use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.6 Response to conventional immunosuppression has been inconsistent,2 and the use of corticosteroids has been associated with a risk of intestinal perforation.6 Intravenous immunoglobulin was found to be useful in a case report of MAP with neurological involvement.7 Eculizumab, a monoclonal anti-C5 antibody, has shown some success in MAP with gastrointestinal involvement.8The patient received aspirin, clopidogrel, and intravenous immunoglobulin infusion (2 mg/kg) with no further neurological deterioration. He was also treated with baricitinib at 4 mg daily. Baricitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor, approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis refractory to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. It modulates the immune system through the inhibition of cytokine activity, and the therapeutic choice was made with the aim of controlling interferon-α–mediated vascular damage. Notably, baricitinib has high CNS penetration with reported cerebrospinal fluid serologic plasma ratios of 20% in mouse studies and has been repurposed for COVID-19 infections to reduce virus-induced neurological damage.9This case highlights the rare but important neurological complication of MAP.

All lesions healed almost completely within 7 weeks, while hypoesthesia and paresthesia of the right face also resolved. The pneumonia responded to antibiotic therapy, while the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels normalized.Trigeminal trophic syndrome is a rare disease following peripheral or central damage to the fifth cranial nerve.1,2 Unilateral ulcers in the sensory distribution of the trigeminal nerve are characteristic.2 The ulcers are most frequently located in the area supplied by the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, that is, on the nasal ala, cheek, and upper lip, sparing the nasal tip.2 Hypoesthesia is often combined with paresthesia in the form of a burning, crawling, and itching sensation. As a result, self-inflicted lesions develop, secondary to unconscious traumatic rubbing and scratching.2 Like skin ulcers from external trauma in general, they typically have sharply demarcated, pauci-inflammatory borders and can be geometrically shaped. There is also the lack of a primary lesion such as pustule, vesicle, or inflammatory papule.In this patient, trigeminal trophic syndrome developed as a complication of an iatrogenic embolic stroke secondary to coronary angiography, affecting the trigeminal nuclei in the brainstem. Other possible causes include medical interventions, such as trigeminal nerve ablation or removal of the gasserian ganglion for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, tumors (astrocytoma or meningioma), infections (herpes zoster, syphilis, or leprosy), and syringobulbia.2 The time between nerve damage and the appearance of ulceration ranges from a few weeks to several years.1,2 In the cases documented so far, the age of the patients ranged from 14 months to 94 years, and women were affected somewhat more often than men.2Careful history and physical examination are essential for making the correct diagnosis. We refrained from obtaining a skin biopsy in this patient as the history and neurological findings were in keeping with the clinical diagnosis, and the results of the neuroimaging studies fitted the expected area of infarction. However, in less clear-cut cases, a biopsy should be considered to exclude malignancy, vasculitis, and other differential diagnoses. Histology from an ulcer due to trigeminal trophic syndrome would show a nonspecific inflammatory reaction.3Because of the rarity of trigeminal trophic syndrome, there are no standardized therapy guidelines. It is important to explain to patients that the ulcers are self-induced. To avoid further injury, patients should keep their fingernails short and wear cotton gloves at night.2 Occlusive dressings are also helpful.1 Carbamazepine or gabapentin may be prescribed to combat paresthesia.2 Plastic surgery may become necessary to cover large cutaneous defects.1Giant cell arteritis is a systemic vasculitis of the large and medium vessels that can lead to scalp necrosis.4 However, the resulting ulceration is usually limited to the frontotemporal region and is accompanied by headache, visual disturbances, and jaw claudication. These symptoms were absent in this patient. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level in this patient were likely due to pneumonia and resolved with antibiotic treatment.Herpes zoster involving the trigeminal nerve may also result in necrosis and facial erosions. Unlike the clinical presentation in this patient, trigeminal zoster is typically limited to only one division of the fifth cranial nerve. In addition, the protracted and progressive course would be unusual in an immunocompetent patient.Finally, pyoderma gangrenosum should be considered in the context of sudden-onset progressive ulceration.

She was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during her infancy. At age 2 years, her parents noticed that she had delayed motor and language milestones. She experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and she became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. She was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video).

Chromosomal analysis using GTG banding revealed a normal karyotype for the patient (46, XX), and her mother’s karyotype analysis revealed a highly skewed pattern of the X chromosome (85:15) by using the X-chromosomal inactivation analysis. Because there is no fragile site seen in the X-chromosome of the patient, we excluded fragile X syndrome. Turner syndrome (45, XO) was debarred as the patient had a normal ovarian function with 2 X-chromosomes. The patient had fulfilled all the 4 main criteria and 5 of 11 supportive criteria of Rett syndrome (RTT).1 Although the clinical features are overlapped with cerebral palsy, sequencing results confirmed the known pathogenic mutation of MECP2 gene variant c.316C>T; R106W (reference sequence: NM_004992.3) causing RTT.Rett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder, and the second most common cause of intellectual disability, predominantly affecting female individuals with a frequency of approximately 1 in 10 000 live births. Most of the RTT cases are caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene situated at Xq28.2,3 The revised RTT diagnostic criteria consist of 4 main criteria (stereotypic hand movements, loss of acquired purposeful hand movements, gait abnormalities, and deterioration of acquired communication skills) and 11 supportive criteria (breathing abnormalities, sleep disturbances, vasomotor disturbances, salivation when awake, growth retardation, small cold hands/feet, abnormal muscle tone, diminished pain response, scoliosis, intense eye communication, and screaming spells). Classic RTT enclosed all main criteria with/without supportive criteria. Variant RTT should consist of at least 2 main criteria and 5 of 11 supportive criteria. The development of RTT symptoms is divided into 4 stages: stage I, early-onset stage (age 6 to 18 months) with progressive microcephaly, delayed motor skills, and hand-wringing; stage II, regression stage (age 1 to 4 years), with a loss of purposeful hand skills and communication, breathing irregularities, and gait abnormalities; stage III, pseudo-stationary stage (age 2 to 10 years) presented with motor problems, apraxia, and seizures; and stage IV, late motor deterioration stage lasts for long with reduced mobility, scoliosis, and abnormal posturing.4 The life expectancy of an individual with RTT was not recorded, but reports stated that few patients live beyond age 40 years.5We summarize that the index patient was affected with classic RTT at the late motor deterioration stage (stage IV) involving a high degree of scoliosis, rigidity, spasticity, and gait abnormalities that made her immobile and completely dependent on others for daily activities. Lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level reported in patients with RTT revealed the imbalance of cholesterol homeostasis, which can be restored using statin compounds that improve RTT symptoms such as gait abnormalities, respiratory functions, and cognition.6The neuroanatomy of RTT unveiled the global reduction in brain volume, especially in dorsal parietal gray matter and anterior frontal lobe,7,8 but for some patients, the magnetic resonance imaging results were normal.9 In this case, reduced corpus callosum, right ventricle enlargement, and asymmetrical ventricles are the serious measures associated with RTT encephalopathy. Altogether, screening for MECP2 mutations should be performed for patients with developmental delay tailed with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. The degree of X-chromosome skewing profile in symptomatic and asymptomatic female carriers will play a significant role in the effect of inheritance of X-linked disorders.10 Hence, we strongly recommend that clinicians to analyze X-chromosomal inactivation patterns in susceptible women during pregnancy as a preliminary prenatal diagnostic test.",Neurology,"A 42-year-old woman presented with clinical features of microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, severe degree of scoliosis, gait abnormality, and encephalopathy (Figure, A and B).

Depressed mental status, bradycardia, emesis, diaphoresis, urination, miosis, muscle weakness, fasciculations, twitching, and myoclonic jerks triggered consideration of acute cholinergic toxicity. Computed tomography findings indicated senile calcifications of the globus pallidus.1 There are no specific radiographic features of cholinergic toxicity.2The patient’s plasma cholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase [BChE]) level of 373 IU/L (reference, 600-1300 IU/L) was consistent with cholinesterase inhibition. Her serum BChE and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were less than the range for healthy individuals analyzed by the same laboratory3 (Figure 2). Serum toxicological analysis using mass spectrometry revealed a trace of temephos, a cholinesterase-inhibiting organophosphate (OP) larvicide commonly used in Cuba, and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid, a common pyrethroid insecticidal metabolite.Direct measurement of serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and serum acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the patient. Shading shows the range (10th to 90th percentile) of enzyme activity in healthy individuals analyzed by the same laboratory.3The source of the patient’s OP poisoning was uncertain. Toxicity commonly results from occupational exposure or suicidal ingestion of agricultural pesticides.4 Cuba’s mosquito control program relies on aggressive insecticide fumigation to mitigate Zika outbreaks.5 The patient was the only one in her travel group to purchase and consume a sandwich (ham, cheese, lettuce, and mayonnaise) and bottled water at the airport, about 30 minutes before symptom onset.On day 2 of admission, symptoms resolved, and on day 4, she was discharged home in good condition. On follow-up at 5 months, the patient reported anorexia and weight loss of 18 kg, daily headaches, insomnia, impaired concentration and memory, tinnitus, and unsteadiness. She had developed painful glove paresthesias with numbness and coldness of the hands. Testing showed modest recovery of BChE activity and normalization of AChE activity (Figure 2). A brain magnetic resonance image was normal, except for bilateral globus pallidi T2 hypointensities consistent with known calcifications; OP-induced delayed neuropathy appeared to underlie some of her late-onset symptoms. Higher prevalence of neurocognitive impairment has been associated with OP neurotoxicity.6Assessment showed clinically significant symptoms on the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire, Migraine Disability Assessment Test, Headache Impact Test, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. This was consistent with neurocognitive symptoms previously reported among US7 and Canadian diplomats3 in Cuba. Her cognitive testing performance with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery platform (http://www.cantab.com) showed impaired attention, executive function, and memory. She failed to complete testing for spatial working memory and decision-making quality; both were found to be significantly impaired among Canadian diplomats with suspected acquired neurotoxicity secondary to OP poisoning.3Vestibulopathy has been described in cohorts of US7,8 and Canadian3 diplomats in Havana. Previous studies associated OP exposure with impaired vestibular function9 and changes in peripheral and central auditory pathways.10 Audiovestibular assessment of this patient 5 months after presentation was suggestive of both auditory neuropathy and a central lesion involving the brainstem.Low-dose environmental exposure to OPs and other insecticides has been hypothesized as a cause for a condition called Havana syndrome among Canadian diplomatic personnel and their families in Cuba between 2016 and 2018, who had various neurological manifestations.3 The patient’s toxicological evidence of insecticide poisoning and her delayed neurological dysfunction matched these recent reports and suggested acquired neurotoxicity secondary to OPs.

In addition, bone marrow and lymph node biopsies did not present any evidence of lymphoma. This patchy enhancement in the spinal cord has been previously described in sarcoidosis.1 However, gallium scan, chest computed tomography, ACE levels both in serum and CSF, and glucose levels in CSF were all normal, while no granulomatous infiltration was observed in lymph node biopsies. The patient did not present with any skin lesions, asthma, or sinusitis; in fact, no other organ was involved. No signs of vasculitis were observed in the biopsied tissues, therefore criteria for the diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome were not fullfiled.2Because lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia were observed, we proceeded to immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing in serum, which was found to be remarkably high (0.825 mg/dL). Mite (Dermatophagus Pteronnysinus and Farinae) antigen–specific IgE levels were both abnormally high (29.1 and 28 U/mL, respectively). The patient’s condition was highly suspicious for parasitic infection; therefore, he was initially treated with albendazole. When parasitic infections were excluded, albendazole was withdrawn and high doses of intravenous steroids were administered instead, followed by 1 month tapering with prednisone. Three months later, vibration sense was remarkably improved, no superficial sensory loss was detected, and minor pyramidal signs were observed in the left leg. In MRI, no gadolinium enhancement was observed, while lesions were markedly improved. The patient was stable for the following 9 months.Myelitis with hyperIgEaemia, also termed as atopic myelitis or eosinophilic myelitis with atopic features, has been previously described mainly in populations of East Asian origin.3,4 Mite antigen-specific IgE levels are frequently found to be abnormally high in this condition. Whether this eosinophilic CNS injury is attributed to mite is still questionable; however, in most of these cases, atopic dermatitis is also present.5 Axonal loss, eosinophilic, and CD8 T-cell infiltration are frequently observed when biopsy is performed.6,7 In MRI, T2 lesions are located mainly in cervical cord; brain involvement has rarely been described.5,8 Owing to blood-barrier disruption and atopic eosinophilic inflammation, patchy gadolinium enhancement and cord swelling are frequent findings.9 These lesions may present as longitudinal extensive myelitis and may mimic multiple sclerosis8,10 or an intramedullary tumor.9 Treatment consists of steroid pulses and may lead to remission. Symptoms may recur; thus, prolonged steroid treatment has been proposed for at least 3 months.10This is a rare case of brain involvement in this atopic eosinophilic CNS inflammatory process, especially in a white person living in Europe. This case presented typical findings of atopic myelitis, such as preferential involvement of the posterior columns of the cervical cord, elevated IgE levels, and suspected atopic diathesis considering his report of itching. The presence of enhancing brain lesions and the absence of atopic dermatitis at the time of the examination were uncommon findings. However, in a cohort of 79 patients with atopic myelitis,5 26.6% of cases did not present any other sign of atopy. Clinicians should be aware of this condition because characteristic laboratory findings may guide the diagnosis without the need of high-risk CNS biopsies.9 During the course of the disease, axonal loss may occur; therefore, early recognition and treatment of this entity may prevent permanent disability.",Neurology,"A white man in his early 40s presented with dizziness and fatigue followed by tingling of both lower extremities as well as gait disturbances.

Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM),D,Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM),"The patient’s severe clinical features included rigidity and painful spasms as well as persistent myoclonus that was associated with typical EMG features. These findings are highly suggestive of PERM. The diagnosis was further supported by positive serum testing results for anti–glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) antibodies (>29.43 mg/dL; normal: <0.15 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 67.967). Testing results for anti–glycine receptor (GlyR) and antiamphiphysin antibodies were negative.First described by Whiteley et al,1 PERM represents a more severe clinical spectrum of stiff person spectrum disorder.2 In this patient, PERM can be distinguished from classic stiff person syndrome by prominent brainstem features, including myoclonus, oculomotor disorder, and a disturbance of respiratory rhythm. Her diffuse neurological symptoms, including encephalopathy (altered mental status), autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia and hyperhidrosis), and spinal cord involvement (urinary retention), also fit within the spectrum of PERM.Worsening myoclonus and encephalopathy could be indicative of progressive myoclonic epilepsies (PMEs), which are a group of genetic disorders with an overall poor prognosis. They typically present in late childhood or adolescence and rarely affect adults. Moreover, rapidly progressive presentations over weeks and a lack of epileptiform discharges on EEG made PMEs unlikely in this patient. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures are characterized by repetitive abnormal stereotypic movements that typically affect the ipsilateral face and arm and are associated with leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 antibodies. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease would be consistent with rapidly progressive dementia and myoclonus. Positive assays for neuronal autoantibodies have occasionally been described in CJD but at very low titers of uncertain significance.3 In this patient, the lack of typical MRI abnormalities and absence of periodic sharp wave complexes on EEGs decreased the likelihood of CJD. Real-time quaking-induced conversion test (with 100% specificity for CJD) could be used in cases of diagnostic confusion.Immune-mediated pathomechanisms that target proteins mainly expressed by inhibitory synapses have been associated with stiff person spectrum disorder.4 Autoantibodies that have been identified include GAD65, GlyR, amphiphysin, dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6, gephyrin, γ-aminobutyric acid-A receptor (GABAAR), and GABA receptor associated protein (GABARAP).5 In PERM patients, GlyR antibodies were the most frequent antibodies identified in approximately half of cases, followed by GAD antibodies and rare amphiphysin or dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6 antibodies.2 Notably, there remains a subgroup of seronegative cases. Thus, although positive autoantibody serology results serve as a strong indicator of PERM, it is not a requirement for the diagnosis, which relies on the clinical manifestations plus EMG features.5 The etiology of PERM can be either paraneoplastic or autoimmune mediated.6 Documented malignancy is often associated with amphiphysin antibodies and less frequently with GAD antibodies.7 In this patient, further neoplasia screening results, including positron emission tomography scan and mammogram, were unremarkable. Autoimmune disorders frequently coexist in patients with positive results for GAD antibodies, primarily type 1 diabetes and thyroid disease.8 This patient received a diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis before her first symptoms occurred. Thus, the presence of a concomitant autoimmune condition and GAD antibodies suggests an autoimmune pathomechanism.Management of PERM is focused on immunotherapy, symptomatic treatment, and tumor screening and treatment.9 Prognosis is highly variable among patients; patients with GAD65 antibodies generally had a worse prognosis than patients with GlyR antibodies.5 Continuous monitoring and maintenance therapy are important as PERM typically has high likelihood of relapse and residual disability.Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus may comprise different diseases associated with various immunological features. While laboratory studies support the pathogenicity of GlyR autoantibodies that target cell surface antigens,9 the pathogenicity of GAD antibodies is controversial given that they direct against intracellular synaptic proteins. It is possible that GAD antibodies may mediate a similar transiently exposed antigen effect like amphiphysin antibodies and impair GABAergic inhibition.10The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg/d) for 5 days, intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg/d) for 5 days with an oral prednisone taper, and intravenous diazepam (60 mg/d) for 5 days followed by a taper within 3 weeks. Oral clonazepam (6 mg/d) was used as maintenance therapy. On 6-month follow up, she demonstrated marked improvement with undetectable serum GAD antibodies.

417,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2753511,"A 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts.The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness.On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use What Would You Do Next?",Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use,Commence treatment with oral olanzapine,Commence treatment with oral clozapine,Commence cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis,Schizophrenia,A,Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use,"There are no clear differences in efficacy between licensed antipsychotic medications in head-to-head trials, although network meta-analyses1,2 suggest that clozapine, olanzapine, and amisulpride are among the most efficacious. Note: Amisulpride is approved for use in the United Kingdom where this patient was treated but is not approved for use in the United States. In addition to the short-term efficacy of antipsychotic medication, there is also evidence that maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs lowers the risk of relapse.3In addition to efficacy, the risk of adverse effects should be carefully considered when discussing treatment options (choice A). The patient in this clinical challenge is of African origin and had overweight, both of which increase the likelihood of adverse metabolic effects developing during antipsychotic treatment.4 Furthermore, psychosis itself is associated with an increased risk of metabolic dysfunction.5 Consequently, if efficacy and other risks of adverse effects are equal, treatments with a high risk of adverse metabolic effects, such as olanzapine (choice B), should be avoided if possible. Alternatives to amisulpride with relatively low levels of adverse metabolic effects include haloperidol and aripiprazole.Although clozapine (choice C) has demonstrated superiority compared with other antipsychotic medications, this has not been established for patients experiencing first episodes of psychosis, and it has a high burden of adverse effects and requires regular monitoring of full blood cell counts because of the risk of agranulocytosis. As a result, it is typically not recommended as a first-line treatment. It is, however, the only drug licensed for treatment resistance, and evidence indicates that early use in patients with treatment resistance leads to better outcomes.6Long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications are an underused treatment option and should be considered early in the illness course.7 However, even if a long-acting injectable drug is to be used from the first episode, it is generally preferable to first start with oral medication to allow an estimation of dosage and accommodate the time a drug takes to reach effective plasma levels.8The patient’s mental health team specialized in the management of first-episode psychosis, and dedicated early-intervention services are associated with considerable benefits for the individual patient and also their family.9 These teams provide social and psychological support in addition to pharmacological treatments. Cognitive behavioral therapy (choice D) does not have clear evidence of efficacy when given as a stand-alone treatment, but it shows benefit when given in combination with an antipsychotic drug.10Oral amisulpride in a dosage of 200 mg, twice daily, was prescribed initially (amisulpride is approved for use in the United Kingdom where the patient was treated). At a review 2 weeks later, although auditory hallucinations had reduced in intensity, the patient’s paranoid delusions persisted. She reported good medication concordance, and this was corroborated by the family. The dosage was therefore increased to 400 mg, twice daily, and cognitive behavioral therapy was also commenced. The patient complained of some stiffness, which improved when the morning dosage was reduced back to 200 mg, twice daily. The psychotic symptoms gradually resolved over the next 4 weeks, although she remained socially withdrawn. Her mother was supportive but became increasingly frustrated about her lack of activity and failure to get a new job, and she frequently criticized her for this. Six months after commencing amisulpride, the patient’s positive symptoms returned, and after concerns regarding weight loss secondary to reduced food and fluid intake, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Antipsychotic plasma levels at the time of admission suggested poor compliance with antipsychotic treatment. After discussing this with the patient, she reported finding it difficult to remember to take the treatment regularly, although her family also stated that she had reported to them that she did not feel the need to continue taking her medication. After considering the options, she elected to try treatment with a long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone to avoid the need to remember to take pills. This was started after trying the oral form for a week to check that it suited her.",Psychiatry,"A 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Encysted empyema thoracis,Lung abscess,Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt,Bronchogenic carcinoma,C. Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt,C,Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt,"A pyogenic brain abscess can occur because of purulent spread from infections in the middle ear, meninges, paranasal sinuses, mastoids, lungs (in cases of empyema, bronchiactesis, and pulmonary abscess), heart (in cases of infective endocarditis or cyanotic congenital heart diseases), gastrointestinal tract, or mouth (in cases of dental infection). A brain abscess can also occur after head trauma and neurosurgical procedures.1 Among the pulmonary causes, digital clubbing and pyogenic brain abscess can be seen in empyema thoracis, lung abscess, bronchiactesis, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary arteriovenous shunts.2 Symptoms of pulmonary arteriovenous shunt depend on the size of the shunt. A patient with a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt may remain asymptomatic, whereas patients with empyema thoracis and lung abscess present with acute fever, chest pain, cough, and dyspnea on exertion or at rest.3With high suspicion of a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt, we performed bubble echocardiography testing with agitated saline infused through the left antecubital vein. During the fifth cardiac cycle, a large number of bubbles appeared in the left atria, suggesting a right-to-left shunt. There was no evidence of a patent foramen ovale. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a large pulmonary arteriovenous shunt in the left lung. The arterial feeder of the shunt arose from the pulmonary artery of the left upper lobe. The shunt drained into the left atrium via a dilated pulmonary vein.Pulmonary arteriovenous shunts can be histologically characterized as pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae (PAVF) or arteriovenous malformations. Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae are abnormal dilated vessels that provide right-to-left shunts between the pulmonary artery and veins, whereas arteriovenous malformations are tumorous hemangiomas with localized overgrowth of thick vessels.4 Only 9% of patients with PAVF develop pyogenic brain abscesses5; in these cases, PAVF can produce paradoxical septic emboli to brain and brain abscesses. The other postulated mechanism is the formation of focal cerebral ischemia attributable to high blood viscosity, which forms a nidus for cerebral infections.6Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae can be hereditary or acquired. Approximately 70% cases of PAVF are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome).7 Epistaxis, hemoptysis, or peripheral telangiectasias are characteristic manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia; these were not seen in this patient.Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae occur twice often in women as in men.7 Nearly 50% patients may have associated peripheral arteriovenous fistulae.3 Because of right-to-left shunting, a state of chronic hypoxemia develops, and it continues to progress if the PAVF is left untreated.The clinical features of a PAVF depend on its size. Up to 55% of patients may remain asymptomatic.3 Common presenting features are dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, and cough. The complications of PAVF occur because of chronic hypoxemia, and they include polycythemia, recurrent syncopal attacks, cyanosis, and clubbing.3 The central nervous system complications of PAVF are transient ischemic attacks, migraine, stroke, brain abscess, and seizures.3 A contrast computed tomographic scan of the chest is a noninvasive way to diagnose PAVF. However, pulmonary angiography is required for the precise localization of feeder and draining vessels and embolization of the arterial feeder.Intravascular embolization of the pulmonary shunt remains a preferred treatment.3 Surgery is considered in patients with allergies to contrast material and those with very large shunts that are not amenable to embolization.In this patient, we closed the pulmonary shunt with an intravascular approach. Shunt closure produced a considerable improvement in oxygen saturation and hematocrit levels. To treat the patient’s brain abscesses, we used injectable ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole on an empirical basis. After 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment, the brain abscesses healed completely.The present case highlights that a combination of features, such as digital clubbing, poor oxygen saturation, a raised hematocrit level, and the absence of congenital heart disease on echocardiography, should prompt clinicians to look for PAVF in a patient with a pyogenic brain abscess. Intravascular or surgical management of PAVF is essential to prevent further complications.",Neurology,"A 34-year-old man presented with headache, double vision, and seizures for 1 month and altered consciousness for 1 week.

Two years prior, he had no obvious inducement and gradually developed indifference, glassy eyes, lethargy, and poor memory. One year prior, the patient’s personality changed dramatically, with notably decreased memory formation but intact short-term memory. He was short-tempered, irritable, hyperactive, and exhibited slight balance instability while walking.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis,C,Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis,"The brain MRI indicated multiple symmetrical strips and slightly longer T1 and T2 signals in the indicated regions. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery indicated high signal (Figure, A) but enhanced MRI did not show enhanced signal. The N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio decreased, and the chlorine to creatine ratio increased. There were no hemorrhagic foci or hemosiderin deposits in susceptibility-weighted imaging. The patient underwent CYP27A1 gene detection because the patient presented with encephalopathy with bilateral Achilles masses, suggesting a possible mutation of c.1214G>A (p.Arg405Gln; Hom). The patient’s various clinical manifestations and abnormal intracranial signals could not be explained as only frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, there were no Kayser-Fleischer rings in the fundus of the eyes, and a normal serum copper blue protein test result excluded Wilson disease. All autoimmune antibodies tested negative, which did not support autoimmune encephalitis. As a result, a diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was made.Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare clinical disease, with a worldwide incidence of fewer than 5 in every 100 000 individuals.1 It is an autosomal recessive, hereditary disease of lipid metabolism often caused by mutation of the CYP27A1 gene. The CYP27A1 gene-coded sterol 27-hydroxylase enzyme catalyzes the initial oxidation of cholesterol to bile acid. Thus, CYP27A1 mutation results in the ineffective conversion of cholesterol to bile acid. Excess cholesterol and cholestanol accumulate in the body. It is hypothesized that a large amount of cholesterol and cholestanol damage the blood-brain barrier, leading to the central nervous system deficits.The clinical manifestations of CTX in patients are diverse. Although the initial symptoms and signs occur in infancy or early childhood, the diagnosis is often incorrect or delayed by 17 to 25 years.2-4 Cholestasis jaundice and idiopathic stubborn diarrhea are often the first symptoms in the neonatal period. Cataracts can be seen in childhood. Tendon xanthoma exists in 70% of patients with CTX. Neurologic symptoms appear relatively late and the symptoms are diverse, including dementia, behavioral disorders, pyramidal tract signs, ataxia, dystonia, epilepsy, spinal cord lesions, and peripheral neuropathy. It has been reported that abnormal MRI signal in the dentate nucleus may be a specific marker of CTX. The abnormal elevation of plasma cholestanol and urinary bile alcohols is usually a laboratory indicator of CTX, but the level of blood cholesterol may not increase or can even decrease.1,5 Worldwide, 49 gene mutation sites have been reported. About 50% of these mutations are located in exon 6-8 of the CYP27A1 gene.1,5,6The treatment of CTX mainly includes a low-fat diet and pharmaceutical treatments such as bile acid replacement therapy, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and statins. Bile acid replacement therapy can inhibit the production of cholesterol and its precursors. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors directly metabolize cholesterol and its precursors, reducing their accumulation. Statins may have some therapeutic effect on CTX. Chenodexycholic acid (CDCA) is the choice for treating neurologic and nonneurologic symptoms in patients with CTX.7 Some studies have found that supplementary treatment of CDCA can restore the level of plasma cholestanol and urinary bile alcohols to normal, but improvements to the neurologic deficits are not obvious. After 1 year of treatment with CDCA, 60% of patients’ neurologic symptoms still worsened progressively, and 20% of patients died. The survival rate of patients with CTX is only related to the age at diagnosis.3In this case, follow-up with the patient occurred after 18 months of oral administration of CDCA. The patient’s glassy eyes improved, whereas the symptoms of agitation and hyperactivity did not. A brain MRI showed that the size of cranial lesions was slightly decreased; however, the patient is now bedridden and unable to care for himself. Early diagnosis and intervention are key factors for the prognosis of CTX.",Neurology,"A 27-year-old Asian man was found with painless masses of about 5.1 cm in diameter that appeared on both Achilles tendons 10 years ago.

Chorea-acanthocytosis,C,Chorea-acanthocytosis,"The patient’s most prominent clinical manifestation was orofacial dyskinesia; therefore, hereditary and secondary dystonia was considered. Wilson disease was excluded because his ceruloplasmin levels were normal. There was no evidence of other metabolic or autoimmune diseases.Acanthocytes in peripheral blood were a significant feature. This led to the consideration of neuroacanthocytosis and inherited disorders of lipoprotein metabolism (eg, abetalipoproteinemia and hypobetalipoproteinemia); the latter leads to vitamin E malabsorption.1 The prominence of caudate head atrophy indicated several extrapyramidal diseases, including Huntington disease, Huntington disease–like 2 (HDL-2), chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc), and McLeod syndrome.1-3 Although his low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B levels decreased, his vitamin E levels were normal; thus, hypobetalipoproteinemia was unlikely. Acanthocytes are not present in Huntington disease, therefore it was excluded.Neuroacanthocytosis describes a group of heterogeneous neurological disorders in which the basal ganglia are affected, leading to various movement disorders. Neuroacanthocytosis includes pantothenate kinase–associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), HDL-2, ChAc, and McLeod syndrome.1,4 Orofacial, lingual, and limb dystonia, dysarthria, choreoathetosis, and spasticity are the initial manifestations of PKAN. Patients usually develop pigmentary retinopathy. Cognitive impairment is also a prominent feature in many PKAN cases. In some patients, iron accumulation in the basal ganglia results in the typical “eye-of-the-tiger” magnetic resonance imaging sign.5 The patient’s fundus examination results were normal, so PKAN was unlikely. Huntington disease–like 2 is autosomal dominant inherited because of an expanded trinucleotide repeat of the junctophilin-3 gene and it presents with chorea, parkinsonism, and dystonia. Deep reflexes are usually brisk, and there is no peripheral nerve or muscle involvement.6 Diminished/absent deep reflexes combined with markedly elevated CK levels and reduced sensory nerve action potentials ruled out HDL-2.Chorea-acanthocytosis is a progressive autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. It is characterized by chorea and orofaciolingual dystonia resulting in orofacial dyskinesias, dysarthria, involuntary vocalizations, and involuntary tongue- and lip-biting. Neuromuscular involvement is another important ChAc feature, including variable muscle weakness and atrophy, areflexia, and mild axonal neuropathy. Creatine kinase elevation (up to 3000 U/L) occurs in most patients with ChAc; however, electromyogram results usually demonstrate neuropathic changes.1,4The patient showed obvious orofacial dyskinesias, combined with substantial CK elevation, axonal peripheral neuropathy, muscle neurogenic damage, and typical caudate head atrophy. This suggested ChAc, although trunk and limb chorea had not yet been revealed. We performed whole-exome sequencing  to verify the diagnosis and exclude other rare causes. Sequencing results revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in the VPS13A gene: a point mutation c.2964 + 5(IVS28)G>A in one allele and c.5881(exon45)C>T in the other. The patient’s parents were carriers of a mutation but were themselves unaffected. Thus, the patient received a diagnosis of ChAc. Haloperidol, 2 mg twice daily, was administered to ameliorate hyperkinetic movement.Chorea-acanthocytosis is caused by mutations of the VPS13A gene, which codes for chorein. Chorein is implicated in intracellular protein sorting and transport; however, to our knowledge, the exact mechanisms are unknown. Chorein is widely expressed in various organs and tissues, including the brain and erythrocytes. In ChAc, chorein is markedly reduced or absent.1,4 Treatment is symptomatic as no curative treatments exist. The disorder progresses gradually, with patients eventually experiencing fatal aspiration pneumonia or other systemic infections.",Neurology,"A 30-year-old man had involuntary orofaciolingual movements for 7 years and unsteady gait for 2 months. At age 23 years, he began experiencing involuntary orofaciolingual movements and vocalizations. At age 27 years, he developed dysphagia, dysarthria, and involuntary tongue- and lip-biting. This oral dyskinesias worsened while eating. However, a handkerchief in the mouth markedly reduced involuntary tongue-biting and mouth movements. No neuropsychiatric symptoms or seizures were exhibited.Neurological examination results revealed mild cognitive decline, with a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of 18/30. Orofacial dyskinesia (Video 1), involuntary vocalizations, and mild dysarthria were exhibited. His muscle strength and tone were normal, but his deep reflexes were diminished or absent. The patient’s sensory and coordination examination results were unremarkable, and bilateral Babinski signs were negative. The patient’s gait was mildly wide based (Video 2).

Erdheim-Chester disease,B,Erdheim-Chester disease,"A skeletal survey radiographic series revealed sclerosis of the bilateral proximal tibias. A tibial bone biopsy by interventional radiology showed replacement of the marrow with fibrous stroma and bland, fibroblast-like spindle cells. Further biopsy testing included hematoxylin-eosin staining with foamy histiocytes and testing for cluster of differentiation 68 protein to confirm histiocyte presence. Tests for S100 and cluster of differentiation 1a proteins had negative results. Together, these findings supported the diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), a rare, non-Langerhans cell–associated histiocytic disorder.Neurosarcoidosis can also cause persistently enhancing parenchymal mass lesions, pachymeningitis, and optic neuritis, but these types of infiltrative soft-tissue and osteosclerotic lesions are atypical. Osteosclerotic lesions are also atypical for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and the relative MRI stability of the brain lesions over time is less consistent (particularly without exposure to glucocorticoids). Anti–myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody can cause an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis phenotype, but anti-MOG disease would not account for extranervous system pathology, and the pattern of persistent nodular enhancement and pachymeningeal involvement are not consistent. The pathology of ECD is also distinct; this case highlights the importance of clinical correlation, systemic evaluation, and pathological confirmation.Mean age at ECD presentation is in the fifth decade of life, and there is a slight male predominance.1,2 Clinical manifestations include bone pain (in 50% of patients), neurologic involvement (50%), diabetes insipidus (25%), and constitutional symptoms (20%).1,2 Neurologic manifestations of ECD almost always occur contemporaneously with systemic symptoms and are the presenting syndrome in about 20% of cases.1 Classic neurologic associations include retro-orbital masslike structures, resulting in proptosis; hypothalamic or pituitary involvement, resulting in endocrinopathic conditions, mainly central diabetes insipidus; multifocal mass–type and infiltrating-type lesions, with a predilection for the brainstem; neurodegeneration; myelopathy; peripheral neuropathy; and dural thickening, which may initially appear similar to a meningioma.2Imaging support for ECD diagnosis typically includes skeletal survey radiography focused on identifying the osteosclerotic lesions in proximal long bones that occur in more than 90% of patients.2,3 On body computed tomography, there are also commonly soft-tissue infiltrative findings in large vessels (60%), retroperitoneum (60%), heart (50%), and lungs (50%); the diagnosis may initially be suggested by a radiologist.2,3 Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography can show hypermetabolic activity in areas of extraosseous over osseous sclerotic lesions.2,4 Pathologic confirmation is most commonly secured by long-bone biopsy. Brain biopsies of ECD frequently show atypical or less specific pathological features than biopsies from other organ systems.5 Retroperitoneal biopsy was considered but deferred in this case after interventional radiology personnel cited concerns about procedural risk and the likelihood of success relative to a long-bone target.About 50% of ECD cases are associated with a BRAF V600E mutation, which activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.2,4,5 Treatment is typically based on BRAF V600E mutation status; vemurafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) has been shown to stabilize or improve disease in patients with this mutation.4,6 In BRAF V600E–negative ECD, emerging data support benefit with cobimetinib, an oral inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein 1 and 2 (MEK1 and MEK2) genes.6 In this patient, the BRAF V600E mutation was technically negative on decalcified long-bone biopsy, but there was concern about a false-negative result (because a nondecalcified specimen was not put aside for genetic analysis). The patient chose an empirical trial of vemurafenib, but empirical treatment with MEK1 and MEK2 inhibition would also have been reasonable, because empirical BRAF inhibition may worsen some cases of Ras-mutated BRAF-negative ECD. At 6 weeks of vemurafenib, his brain MRI exhibited marked improvement, with near resolution of abnormal findings (Figure 2) and gradual clinical improvement, supporting that his ECD was most likely BRAF V600E positive.A brain coronal T1 postgadolinium magnetic resonance image showing substantially improved enhancing mass in the brainstem.",Neurology,"A 53-year-old man developed patchy numbness in his right arm.

Glioma,C,Glioma,"The clinical case and imaging were most suggestive of spinal cord tumor; subsequent spinal cord biopsy was consistent with H3-K27M mutant diffuse midline glioma. This case highlights an important early diagnostic consideration in the approach to myelopathy. Etiologies can be broadly categorized as inflammatory or noninflammatory, and cerebrospinal fluid is used to distinguish between them. Although the patient’s imaging demonstrated extensive enhancement, cerebrospinal fluid was repeatedly noninflammatory (absent pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands and normal IgG index). Infectious and postinfectious causes of myelopathy would typically be associated with these inflammatory markers as would immune-mediated causes of spinal cord dysfunction including neurosarcoidosis.Broadly speaking, causes of noninflammatory myelopathy include compressive, toxic, metabolic, vascular, and neoplastic etiologies. Extrinsic compression from degenerative cervical spine disease is the most common of these, but the patient’s MRI did not reveal any significant degenerative changes. Although she reported using a variety of nutraceutical products, an extensive literature review did not find any that were associated with central nervous system complications. More specifically, there was no evidence of excessive zinc ingestion, a well-recognized cause of hypocupremia-associated myelopathy. Furthermore, the patient denied a history of inadvertent pyridoxine (vitamin B6) excess. This can occur through overconsumption of energy drinks, body-building supplements, and energy bars and results in symptoms of a sensory-predominant myelopathy or ganglionopathy. Toxicology screen was negative and there was no reported history of nitrous oxide exposure, radiation, or heroin use—all known culprits of longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions, some of which are enhancing.1 Screening for common metabolic causes including B12, copper, and vitamin E deficiency was unrevealing. Finally, although spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas are frequently associated with enhancement, MRI did not reveal tortuous flow voids or missing-piece sign2 and a spinal conventional angiogram was normal.The slowly progressive myelopathic symptoms and paraclinical data suggest the possibility of an underlying neoplasm. Given this suspicion, a thoracic (T5) spinal cord lesion biopsy was performed. Figure 2 shows representative photomicrographs of the biopsy. The histologic sections demonstrate slightly hypercellular tissue with scattered atypical cells and focal areas of necrosis, findings reminiscent of an infiltrating neoplasm. Immunohistochemical stain showed strong nuclear staining in the atypical cells for H3-K27M mutation specific antibody. H3-K27me3 was lost in the neoplastic cells, confirming the hypomethylation phenotype. These findings are diagnostic of a diffuse midline glioma, H3-K27M mutant, World Health Organization grade IV. This entity was added to the 2016 revised version of the World Health Organization classification of brain tumors.3 These high-grade gliomas are most commonly found in the pons but have been described at other midline sites including the thalamus, basal ganglia, and spinal cord.4 One series of adult patients with H3-K27M gliomas had evidence of abnormal enhancement on imaging in 21 of 26 cases.5 Regardless of location, they are universally associated with local infiltration and poor prognosis.6 Although the diagnosis remains ominous, a recent phase II study involving patients with recurrent glioblastoma and treatment with imipridone ONC201, a selective antagonist of the G protein-coupled receptor DRD2, resulted in a dramatic response in one patient with a H3-K27M mutation.7 A phase II open-label study is actively recruiting participants with this mutation and referral to this trial and others like it should be considered by physicians caring for these patients.Spinal cord biopsy of a lesion on T3 through T9.

Needle electromyography (EMG) results showed frequent fasciculations, doublets, triplets, and multiple myokymic discharges (Figure 2) in several muscles of the upper and lower extremities in addition to the abdomen (biceps, gastrocnemius, first interosseous muscle, and rectus abdominis). The voluntary activation results were normal. These features are consistent with a diagnosis of neuromyotonia. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of HEK293 transfected cells showed positive voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC)–complex antibodies, with contactin-associated protein-like 2 antibodies (CASPR2-Ab) titer at 1:100 and leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein 1 antibodies (LGI1-Ab) titer at 1:10. A diagnosis of autoimmune Isaacs syndrome was made. Mycophenolate mofetil, 1000 mg twice daily, and a tapering dose of prednisone, 60 mg, were prescribed. At the 3-month follow-up, his muscle twitching and skin lesion had subsided. Repeated serum CASPR2-Ab and LGI1-Ab results were negative.Nerve conduction studies show the presence of M-waves after discharges in the posterior tibialis nerve.Needle electromyography results show multiple myokymic discharges in the rectus abdominis.Isaacs syndrome is the most well-known type of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. It was first described in 1961 in 2 patients who presented with persistent generalized muscle stiffness and twitching with needle EMG results demonstrating spontaneous motor unit action potentials.1 Isaacs syndrome is characterized by continuous muscle twitching and myokymia, muscle hypertrophy, weight loss, and hyperhidrosis.2 Spontaneous irregular discharges can be found frequently with typical di, tri, or multiple single motor unit discharges on needle EMG and after-discharges can be found on motor nerve conduction studies.1 Isaacs syndrome can be caused by abnormal autoimmunity, paraneoplastic syndrome,  or genetic conditions.1 Voltage-gated potassium channel–complex antibodies against CASPR2 and LGI1 are essential to the pathophysiology of autoimmune Isaacs syndrome.3Contactin-associated protein-like 2 antibodies have been found to associate with Isaacs syndrome, whereas LGI1-Ab are associated with limbic encephalitis.3 Some patients with positive LGI1-Ab and CASPR2-Ab results may present with different clinical features.4,5Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability is also common in Morvan syndrome. Morvan syndrome is also thought to be associated with positive CASPR2-Ab and LGI1-Ab, which is defined by myokymia or neuromyotonia, dysautonomic symptoms, severe sleep disturbance, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement, such as fluctuating encephalopathy.6 The lack of CNS involvement in this patient makes this condition less likely.Involuntary muscle movements can also can be seen in rippling muscle disease. Rippling muscle disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding caveolin-3, a membrane-associated protein of skeletal muscle fibers. Its clinical features include percussion-induced rapid muscle contractions and involuntary rolling muscle contractions or muscle rippling.7 The hyperirritability originates directly from muscle fibers, not from the peripheral nerve. Electromyography results showed motor unit potential discharges associated with rippling,7 which is different from this case.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also characterized by muscle twitching (fasciculations), weakness, and atrophy with mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs on neurological examination results.8 An EMG study usually shows fasciculations, diffused acute denervation, and compensatory chronic reinnervation in different body regions, which is different from this case.This patient has had psoriasis for 30 years. Patients with LGI1 or CASPR2 antibodies are often found to have other coexistent autoimmune conditions, like psoriasis,9 which may suggest that they have a common autoimmune pathogenesis. In the study by Binks et al,9 4 of 6 patients (66.7%) with psoriasis and VGKC-complex antibodies harbored the psoriasis risk allele. The extended haplotypes may explain the specific comorbidities of positive VGKC-complex antibodies and psoriasis.In summary, there are 2 diagnostic clues from the videos: neuromyotonia is the main feature, and the presence of psoriasis raises the possibility of underlying autoimmune vulnerability. The purple striae indicates long-term steroid usage.

He described transient episodes of expressive speech difficulties, paroxysmal dizziness, and involuntary nonsuppressible jerks of the right arm, which occurred without warning and were associated with mild disorientation. Video electroencephalography (EEG) captured the movements (Figure, A). They consisted of involuntary, synchronous contractions of the right face, arm, and leg that were sustained for a few seconds before muscle relaxation occurred (Figure, B and C; Video). The movements were not elicited by action or exertion. There was no epileptic abnormality that correlated with the movements on EEG, and head magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable.A, Electroencephalogram (EEG) during the event (bipolar montage, 60-Hz filter, 7-uV/mm sensitivity). B, Patient position prior to the event. C, Patient position while experiencing an involuntary, sustained contraction of the right lower face, arm, and leg lasting almost 2 seconds before spontaneous resolution. The event took place during the time span marked with red vertical lines on the EEG and did not show a clear change from baseline rhythm. Muscle artifacts are seen prior to and during the event. What Is Your Diagnosis?",Myoclonus,Paroxysmal dyskinesia,Faciobrachial dystonic seizures,Tic disorder,C. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures,C,Faciobrachial dystonic seizures,"Paroxysmal dyskinesia (choice B) is unlikely, because the phenomena are not triggered by movement or exertion, which would suggest kinesigenic or exercise-induced dyskinesia, respectively. Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia may occur, but the attacks would last minutes to hours rather than seconds. Furthermore, his age at onset is late for this group of genetic disorders. A tic disorder (choice D) is also unlikely, because there is no premonitory urge that is relieved by performing the tic, and the movement is not even briefly suppressible. The movement is jerky, but contractions are sustained for a few seconds, which is too prolonged for myoclonus (choice A) and more reminiscent of dystonic posturing.The phenomenology of the patient’s abnormal movement was most closely in keeping with faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS), and serum testing was positive for anti–leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI-1) antibodies by a cell-based assay. These tonic muscle contractions classically affect the lower face and ipsilateral arm, but involvement of the leg, alternating episodes, or bilateral episodes may occur.1 They are typically brief (<3 seconds) and can occur up to hundreds of times a day.2 These movements are nearly pathognomonic for anti–LGI-1 autoimmunity and can be seen in about half of patients with this trait.3 Although EEG is frequently obscured by muscle artifact, preceding rhythmic δ activity and EEG attenuation after FBDS may be seen.4 Associated ictal features may occur with FBDS, including fear, oral automatism, and/or loss of awareness.4The LGI-1 protein is secreted by neurons in the central nervous system and forms a transsynaptic complex involved in synaptic transmission of neuronal excitability.5 The association between LGI-1 protein dysfunction and altered neuronal excitability is seen in autosomal-dominant lateral temporal–lobe epilepsy, also known as autosomal-dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features, in which an LGI-1 gene mutation is identified in one-third to half of affected individuals.6 This disorder is usually characterized by a family history of focal seizures, often involving auditory auras (humming, buzzing, ringing, or [less frequently] complex sounds or distortions) or ictal aphasia in the absence of structural abnormalities or other substantial neurological deficits.6Anti–LGI-1 IgG4 antibodies are thought to be causative of LGI-1 encephalitis, which is the second most common cause of autoimmune encephalitis after anti–N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis and has an incidence of about 1 case per million population.5 Anti–LGI-1 autoimmunity often begins with subtle focal seizures or FBDS, which precede the onset of cognitive decline, personality changes, psychiatric symptoms, and tonic-clonic seizures typical of autoimmune limbic encephalitis.3 Other clinical manifestations include sleep disturbances, paroxysmal dizzy spells, parkinsonism, and myoclonus.7 Hyponatremia may be found in up to half of affected patients and can be a clue to the diagnosis. A malignant condition is identified in about 10% of patients and may occur in the thymus, lung, breasts, prostate, ovaries, kidneys, or alimentary tract.5 On magnetic resonance imaging, T2 hyperintensity of the medial temporal lobes is commonly found in patients with anti–LGI-1 limbic encephalitis, and T1 hyperintensity of the basal ganglia may be seen in patients with FBDS.7Recognition of FBDS is crucial to arrange for appropriate testing of anti–LGI-1 antibodies. Serum should be tested, because it may have a higher sensitivity than cerebrospinal fluid.3,7 Expedited immunotherapy in patients with FBDS is more effective than antiseizure medications to control the movements and is associated with reduced long-term disability.8 Early treatment may also prevent the evolution from FBDS to limbic encephalitis in patients with preserved cognition, further emphasizing the need to accurately diagnose these movements promptly.1 Even with immunotherapy, however, relapses can occur in one-third of patients,3 and close clinical monitoring is required so that treatment can be intensified if necessary.The patient was treated with 1-g doses of intravenous methylprednisolone for 5 days, with an oral prednisone taper that consisted of 50 mg daily for a month, followed by further decreases of 10 mg monthly. After 1 day of treatment, he had full resolution of FBDS and no further spells of any kind. On 4-month follow-up, he continued to be symptom-free.",Neurology,"A man in his 60s was evaluated in the epilepsy monitoring unit for various spells he had been having up to 5 times a day over the previous 8 months. He described transient episodes of expressive speech difficulties, paroxysmal dizziness, and involuntary nonsuppressible jerks of the right arm, which occurred without warning and were associated with mild disorientation. Video electroencephalography (EEG) captured the movements (Figure, A). They consisted of involuntary, synchronous contractions of the right face, arm, and leg that were sustained for a few seconds before muscle relaxation occurred (Figure, B and C; Video). The movements were not elicited by action or exertion.

X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,C,X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,"The patient had no further events following his admission and neurodiagnostic workup. His examination was consistent with peripheral nerve pathology (diminished reflexes and decrements in sensorium), which appeared to be longstanding as demonstrated by pes planovalgus and tight Achilles tendons. The patient’s superimposed acute events were felt to be reflective of a strokelike phenomenon, given the duration and pattern of neurologic symptoms.In reviewing the patient’s case, examination, and neuroimaging, it was determined that the patient’s clinical findings fit most closely with a diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX). The imaging findings, particularly with prominent bilateral and symmetric restricted diffusion in the supratentorial white matter, were thought to be more characteristic of CMTX-related strokelike episode and would not be typical for leukodystrophies (specifically, metachromatic leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and Alexander disease). Given the symmetric pattern of involvement, mitochondrial disorders were considered although were thought to be less likely given the patient’s normal growth and development and lack of lactic acidosis and other laboratory abnormalities. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was considered, but the large-scale confluent lesions involving only the white matter were considered unusual as would be the symmetry of this pattern. Multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica typically do not exhibit these patterns and were thought to be very low on the differential. Myelin oligodendrocyte antibody spectrum disorders can present with large T2-hyperintense lesions but are rarely symmetric or isolated to the white matter only. Although a classic mimic in nearly all central demyelinating disorders, central nervous system lymphoma was lower on the differential based on symmetry, age of patient, and lack of other findings.Ultimately, the patient was discharged at full neurologic capacity. He had an outpatient neurogenetics workup that identified a hemizygous mutation in gap junction β-1 (GJB1) c.227 t > G. Loss-of-function variants in the GJB1 gene are associated with type 1 CMTX (CMTX1) and thus presumed to be a pathogenic variant.As noted previously, CMTX1 is an inherited neuropathy caused by mutation of the GJB1 gene. This gene encodes for connexin 32, which is a gap junction protein that is expressed by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system.1 Owing to X-linked inheritance, this disorder mostly affects male patients, although female carries may also be symptomatic, as is possible in this case. Transient neurologic events, also described as strokelike episodes, have been reported in the literature and are often associated with symmetric white matter abnormalities.1-7 The pathophysiology underlying these events and white matter changes is unknown, although it is presumed to be associated with  connexin 32 expression in oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system.8 Because most patients with CMTX1 do not have long-term central neurologic phenomenon, there is great debate regarding whether other connexin subtypes may provide compensatory support at gap junctions in patients.9,10Clinically, the strokelike episodes observed in CMTX1 are heterogenous and include transient generalized weakness resembling periodic paralysis, ataxia, dysarthria, or combinations of these deficits.1,6,7 The fluctuation in these neurologic disturbances and magnetic resonance imaging findings should prompt suspicion of the diagnosis. The central nervous system phenotype of CMTX1 disease has a favorable prognosis with respect to central nervous system function, and recognition will avoid unnecessary investigations and potentially harmful therapeutic intervention. There is no clear evidence for steroids or other immunomodulatory therapy in CMTX1-associated transient neurologic phenomenon, with clinical and imaging findings usually being self-limited.6,7This case highlights one of the rarer strokelike presentations in a patient with a neuromuscular disorder. The presence of long-standing peripheral nerve pathology should prompt interrogation of other etiologies to strokelike presentations in children and young adults.",Neurology,"A 13-year-old boy with a longstanding history of gait imbalance presented with 2 episodes of acute-onset left hemibody weakness and dysarthria without changes in sensorium in a 24-hour period.

Susac syndrome,C,Susac syndrome,"Susac syndrome is a rare disorder caused by occlusions of microvessels in the brain, retina, and inner ear, with an autoimmune causative mechanism presumed based on signs of inflammation in biopsies of the brain and CSF testing, as well as contrast enhancement on retinal and brain imaging and case reports of good response to immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies.1 John O. Susac, MD, described the initial case in the mid-1970s after he encountered a young woman with a previously unreported triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and deafness.2 Since then, more than 300 cases of Susac syndrome have been reported in the literature worldwide with female individuals (aged 20-40 years) affected more frequently than male individuals.1 The prevalence of this disease may not be as rare as once thought, given that the full clinical triad rarely exists at time of initial presentation and many cases are often being misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis.3-6At clinical onset, the most common manifestation is central nervous system symptoms, followed by visual and hearing or vestibular disturbances. Headaches are present at disease onset in more than 80% of patients and often resemble migraine. Central nervous system symptoms can include focal neurological deficits owing to transient ischemic attack or stroke; later in the disease, patients can develop global deficits (eg, encephalopathy, dementia).1,7,8 Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain typically shows punctate hyperintense deep white and gray matter lesions consistent with microinfarctions on T2/FLAIR, some of which may have restricted diffusion suggestive of acute ischemia and contrast enhancement. Involvement of the central portion of the corpus callosum, rather than the periphery (as in multiple sclerosis), as evidenced by presence of so-called snowball lesions (Figure 1), is considered a characteristic sign of Susac syndrome.1 Echocardiography is usually low yield, because the deep location of the microinfarctions, including the corpus callosum, makes cardioembolism less likely. Cerebrospinal fluid studies may show pleocytosis and elevated protein, typically without oligoclonal bands. Catheter-based cerebral angiography results are usually normal. An audiogram usually shows bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Retinal fluorescein angiography reveals unilateral or bilateral branched retinal artery occlusions and/or arterial wall hyperfluorescence (Figure 2) owing to microvasculitis, even in patients who are visually asymptomatic.1 Fundoscopy typically shows branched retinal artery occlusions  as well as retinal arterial atheromatous plaques, ischemic fluffy white patches, and/or tiny hemorrhages.8Retinal fluorescein angiogram of the right eye with leakage of fluorescein dye through the wall of a branch retinal artery (pink arrowhead) and branch retinal artery occlusive disease inferiorly and temporally (yellow arrowheads).Susac syndrome is frequently misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis owing to the presence of white matter lesions, corpus callosum involvement, and CSF pleocytosis; however, based on current multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria,9 the absence of oligoclonal bands, involvement of deep gray matter, and presence of retinal and auditory pathology argue against this diagnosis. Recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers, uveitis or retinal vasculitis, pathergy, and skin or vascular lesions, characterize Behçet disease.10 The lack of ulcers and presence of corpus callosum pathology makes the diagnosis of Behçet disease unlikely. The imaging phenotype and involvement of hearing do not support the diagnosis of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Genetic testing for CADASIL may be considered in patients with cryptogenic stroke with appropriate MRI findings; in this case, CADASIL genetic testing was not ordered based on clinical phenotype favoring Susac syndrome.There is no consensus on the treatment of Susac syndrome because of the lack of large well-designed studies addressing this rare, underreported disease. Based on the idea that Susac syndrome may have an inflammatory causative mechanism, some authors have reported variable benefit with immunosuppressive agents.5,8The patient has had improvement in auditory symptoms.

Diabetic striatopathy,C,Diabetic striatopathy,"The patient’s presentation of a unilateral subacute onset of choreiform movement that was associated with pathognomonic MRI findings in the setting of long-standing diabetes led us to the diagnosis of diabetic striatopathy. Diabetic striatopathy is a constellation of neurologic abnormalities that is characterized by sudden-onset hemiballism or hemichorea and striatal abnormalities on neuroimaging in a poorly controlled patient with diabetes.1 Delayed onset of hemichorea after an episode of hyperglycemia with or without ketoacidosis has also been reported.2 Dyskinesias, including hemichorea-hemiballism, occur because of the dysfunction of the corpus striatum and are usually reversible with the restoration of homeostasis. Diabetic striatopathy is an underdiagnosed complication of diabetes that is more frequently encountered in type 2 diabetes than type 1 diabetes.3 Chorea has also been reported after hypoglycemic episodes in people with diabetes.4 The main mode of treatment includes the correction of the metabolic derangement by fluids and insulin infusion. Patients with refractory disease require additional drugs, including γ-aminobutyric acid–ergic, neuroleptic, or dopamine-depleting agents as in this case.5 In 90% of the patients, clinical symptoms completely resolve with or without radiologic resolution, varying from 2 to 28 days. As noted in the workup, metabolic disorders, such as hypernatremia and hyponatremia, hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperthyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism and hyperparathyroidism can cause chorea and they need to be ruled out.Sydenham chorea (SC) is a nonsuppurative sequela of group A streptococcus infection and rheumatic fever.6 This is typically seen in children and rarely presents in adults. There was no history or other evidence of streptococcal infection in the patient. Moreover, the unilateral presentation of chorea makes SC quite unlikely in this patient. Chorea can be a key manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, and antiphospholipid syndrome. Chorea that are associated with autoimmune disorders are thought to share a pathophysiology with postinfectious SC.7 A subacute form of chorea has been reported in a variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,8 HIV infection, and slow-growing tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging in this case ruled out slow-growing tumors. The lack of cognitive changes, healthy electroencephalogram results, and the clinical course ruled out the new variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and HIV infection in this patient.Paraneoplastic chorea has been reported with renal cancer, small cell cancer of the lung, and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Nontraditional movements, including chorea, have been reported as paraneoplastic manifestations of anti–N-methyl-d-aspartate antibody–secreting tumors. In this patient, unilateral chorea and negative screen results made it unlikely that the chorea was of paraneoplastic origin. Wilson disease is a disorder of copper excretion caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene that results in relentless multisystemic copper accumulation. Investigation demonstrates low ceruloplasmin levels in most patients (normal in 5-15% of cases), low serum copper levels, increased 24-hour urine copper excretion, and abnormal liver function test results that were not seen in this patient. Brain MRI usually shows bilateral hyperintensities in the basal ganglia or claustrum on T2-weighted images or signal abnormalities in the midbrain. Chorea is rare in Wilson disease and is usually bilateral.Chorea can occur as a consequence of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or in the context of low-grade ischemic changes in the basal ganglia without obvious infarction.9 The neostriatum and the subthalamic nucleus have been frequently implicated in strokes that cause hemichorea. Hemichorea or hemiballism occurs in less than 1% of patients with a stroke.10 In this patient, neuroimaging results showed no findings of restricted diffusion that was concerning for a stroke. Most patients with chorea following a stroke show a spontaneous resolution of chorea within 1 or 2 years.

He was well kempt, was quiet during his interview, and provided short answers. He reported that he no longer enjoyed his former interests and could not relate to people at college or to friends, but there were no clear signs of depressive disorders. No formal thought disorders were elicited. He was 80% convinced that random people looked and talked about him when he was out in public but was able to question it. He stated that these people were probably commenting on the way he looked, but he did not believe these individuals meant him harm. He never acted on these thoughts. He also reported a vague feeling of perplexity and derealization.

Fully addressing their presenting problems requires a prognosis, which is forecasting their risk (ie, probability) of developing future outcomes. The development of semistructured psychometric interviews (prognostic tools) to assess CHR-P criteria has allowed formulating a prognosis of being at risk or not at risk for psychosis.3 The original prognostic tool in this field (CAARMS2) was developed on the basis of accumulating knowledge of the specific symptoms that may predate the onset of psychosis (defined as binary outcome). The CAARMS is transdiagnostic, allowing the presence of several comorbid mental disorders at baseline, which are frequent in these patients.6 Specific training is needed to use it, and its administration usually requires 2 hours in the context of a clinical assessment.7 Extensive international validation has confirmed that in people referred to psychosis early-detection services, the CAARMS has an adequate prognostic performance, comparable with other prognostic instruments used in medicine.3 Vice versa, it does not work well outside these samples.3 Its potentials include a good ability to rule out a state of risk for psychosis, while its limitations include only a moderate ability to rule in a state of risk for psychosis (Figure).4 This prognostic tool has allowed one of the first preventive approaches to psychotic disorders to be implemented in psychiatry.8 Several other variants of the CAARMS have been developed with almost comparable prognostic performance.3 The use of these prognostic tools in individuals seeking help at psychosis early-detection clinics can impact their clinical management by (1) informing patients about their risk of developing psychosis, (2) establishing whether clinical monitoring is required, and (3) deciding whether to initiate preventive treatments or not.Individuals seeking help at specialized psychosis early-detection clinics have a higher risk of developing psychosis (15% at 3 years4) than the general population (0.43% at 3 years).5 Those who will meet the clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) criteria at the prognostic interview (Comprehensive Assessment of At-risk Mental States [CAARMS]) will have only a modest increase in their level of risk for psychosis (1.8-fold, from 15% to 26%). Those not meeting the CHR-P criteria3 will have a substantial decrease of their risk (9-fold, from 15% to 1.56%).This patient was meeting the CHR-P criteria and therefore was predicted to have an enhanced risk (26% at 3 years3) (Figure) of developing emerging psychotic disorders over time, compared with help-seeking individuals not meeting CHR-P criteria (who have only 1.56% risk of developing psychosis at 3 years3) (Figure). First, we shared with this patient the result of the prognostic test in the context of psychoeducational support offered by psychosis early-detection clinics. Informing patients about their risks is an essential component of preventive approaches in all branches of medicine. For example, individuals who meet CHR-P criteria accumulate several risk factors for psychosis, some of which may be potentially modifiable.9 The second clinical impact of our prognostic assessment was to recommend close clinical monitoring for adverse clinical outcomes during the ensuing 3 years because this is the peak of risk.3 Finally, this patient was offered specific preventive interventions (indicated primary prevention) that were based on psychological therapies (cognitive behavioral therapy). These treatments aim to improve the presenting symptoms and disability10 and to stop the progression to psychosis. Although psychological therapies are currently recommended (while antipsychotics are not recommended),8 their effectiveness is not fully established and other experimental therapeutics have been investigated. Over the past years, ω-3 interventions have received high levels of interest because of their benign profile, but they were recently found not to be effective. The first ever pharmaceutical-funded randomized clinical trial in these patients (testing a phosphodiesterase-9 inhibitor) has just started and other first-in-class treatments are under testing.At 3-year follow-up, the patient had not developed psychosis.

Per the clinical features, fundoscopy findings, and abnormalities on MRI, autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) was suspected. Genetic testing identified biallelic pathogenic SACS mutations.Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull, including axial T2-weighted scan (A) revealing linear pontine hypointensities (black arrowhead) and lateral pontine hyperintensities (yellow arrowhead); sagittal T1-weighted scan (B) demonstrating atrophy of upper cerebellar vermis (yellow arrowhead), posterior fossa arachnoid cyst (asterisk), thinning of the corpus callosum (black arrowhead), and cervical spinal cord atrophy (white arrowhead).The first description of ARSACS derives from families of the Charlevoix and Saguenay regions of Quebec, Canada. The patients had unsteadiness and falls at gait initiation, followed by slowly progressive spastic ataxia and axonal-demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Every affected individual presented with slurred speech, saccadic pursuit, and nystagmus, accompanied by a distinctive fundus appearance involving an increased visibility of the retinal nerve fibers hiding parts of the retinal vessels.1 Identification of the causative gene, SACS, and its product, the protein sacsin, occurred in 2000. Outside of Canada, most patients have disease onset in the first decade of life and display progressive spastic ataxia and peripheral neuropathy. However, retinal abnormalities are less frequent in non-Canadian individuals, and divergent presentations may exhibit adult onset, hearing loss, and supranuclear vertical gaze palsy.2 Moreover, the ataxia, spasticity, and peripheral neuropathy of the classic ARSACS triad might each be missing in patients with SACS mutations.3 Findings on MRI include upper cerebellar vermis atrophy, linear pontine T2 hypointensities, lateral pontine T2 hyperintensities, thickening of middle cerebellar peduncles, posterior fossa arachnoid cyst, corpus callosum thinning, and parietal atrophy.3 Optical coherence tomography reveals thickening of the RNFL, which is unknown in any other progressive neurodegenerative condition. Also, OCT is more sensitive in detecting retinal abnormalities in ARSACS compared with fundoscopy.4The authors of the original series considered the fundus seen in ARSACS similar to that in the acute phase of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).1 Patients with LHON occasionally exhibit variable degrees of ataxia, spasticity, and peripheral neuropathy,5,6 and OCT may show increased RNFL thickness.7 However, retinal changes are asymptomatic and visual function is usually preserved in ARSACS, while in LHON, considerable visual loss occurs, accompanied by optic atrophy in late stages.Friedreich ataxia is the most common hereditary ataxia worldwide. Patients typically have childhood-onset ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and a positive Babinski sign.8 This phenotype may resemble ARSACS, with mild or no spasticity. Nonetheless, OCT results are distinguishing; they demonstrate RNFL atrophy in most individuals with Friedreich ataxia.9Complicated cases of hereditary spastic paraplegia usually have autosomal recessive inheritance, and ataxia occurs in several types.10 One should differentiate patients with ataxia and corpus callosum atrophy, such as autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia-11 and spastic paraplegia-15, from ARSACS.3 Thickening of the RNFL is not a feature of hereditary spastic paraplegia, which may guide molecular investigation.In conclusion, fundoscopy and OCT findings were important diagnostic clues in a patient with mild spasticity; OCT can be diagnostic in ARSACS4 and is useful to refine genetic testing in recessive ataxias and spastic paraplegia. ARSACS is not curable, has no specific treatment, and progresses slowly, so diagnosis bears important prognostic implications.

He was found to have nonischemic cardiomyopathy and died on hospital day 13. What Is Your Diagnosis?",Neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease),Amyloidosis,Susac syndrome,Cobalt toxicity,D. Cobalt toxicity,D,Cobalt toxicity,"The patient’s prior hip replacement surgeries raised the possibility of cobalt toxicity as a cause of his constellation of symptoms. The patient had his first hip replacement surgery 7 years prior to presentation with a ceramic-on-ceramic implant and had required 2 revision surgeries. During the revisions, which occurred 2 years prior to presentation, extensive soft-tissue metallosis was noted. Given this history of failed hip replacement, serum cobalt levels were checked and were consistently elevated, ranging between 280 to 779 ng/mL (a normal level is less than 1.5 ng/mL). A plain-film radiographic image of the hip showed that the hardware was intact, and there was heterotopic ossification in the surrounding soft tissue (not shown). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a pseudotumor of metallosis (Figure, B). The patient was referred to orthopedic surgery for revision but died before surgical intervention.The toxic effects of cobalt have been known since the 1960s, when the treatment of anemia with cobalt and the addition of cobalt to beer led to adverse effects.1,2 In more recent years, joint replacements have become an increasingly recognized cause of systemic cobalt toxicity. Potential neurotoxic effects of cobalt include sensorineural hearing loss, optic neuropathy, and sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy.3,4 Cognitive impairment has also been reported.5 Other systemic effects of cobalt include cardiomyopathy and thyroid dysfunction.6In this patient, bilateral vision loss with long segments of optic nerve enhancement immediately call to mind a demyelinating process, particularly neuromyelitis optica. The patient’s male sex and the lack of oligoclonal bands could be consistent with a seronegative case of neuromyelitis optica; however, the concurrent hearing loss is atypical. Furthermore, many nondemyelinating disease processes can disrupt the blood-nerve barrier and lead to abnormal optic nerve enhancement. Amyloidosis can cause peripheral neuropathy and cardiomyopathy but do not explain the patient’s presenting complaints of vision and hearing loss. Vision loss in Susac syndrome is because of occlusion of retinal arteries, and the syndrome is often associated with lesions in the corpus callosum. These findings were absent on fluorescein angiogram and magnetic resonance imaging. Cobalt toxicity is the unifying diagnosis that accounts for the patient’s neurological decline, as well as his endocrine and cardiac dysfunction. Metallic debris from prior failed implants may have contributed to the metallosis.7While cobalt toxicity is rare among the many patients who have benefited from joint replacement, there are an increasing number of people undergoing these procedures,8 making cobalt toxicity a growing area of concern. Neurologists may be the first clinicians to evaluate a patient suffering from cobalt toxicity, given the frequency of neurologic symptoms.4,5 The patient in this report had symptoms of peripheral neuropathy 1.5 years prior to his death from cardiomyopathy. If a patient with a history of a metal-containing implant develops symptoms that lead to concern of cobalt toxicity, serum cobalt levels and imaging of the joint should be obtained. If elevated cobalt levels and metallosis are discovered, surgical revision for source control should be considered urgently because it is considered the definitive treatment. Many of the effects of cobalt toxicity can be reversed with surgery. Conversely, failure to diagnose or treat expediently can have fatal consequences.7,9,10",Neurology,"A 63-year-old man with a history of well-controlled hypertension, lumbar stenosis, and hip arthroplasty with revisions presented with bilateral loss of vision and hearing for several weeks.

Her OCD symptoms consisted of concerns about dirt or germs and fears that she or others would get sick because of spreading these contaminants. She had extensive rituals involving washing her hands repeatedly and cleaning household items. She reported, “I wash everything anyone else touches…I hardly let anyone into our home, and if I do, I wash down furniture and often have to wash the floors.” She avoided handling groceries, mail, and money and would not visit with family members owing to concerns that they were contaminated.She had experienced OCD symptoms since age 10 years but did not formally receive a diagnosis until 10 years later. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) resulted in little benefit even at maximum doses (eg, 400 mg of fluvoxamine daily, 200 mg of sertraline daily). A trial of clomipramine up to 250 mg daily also failed to reduce her OCD symptoms. Augmentation trials of antipsychotic medications, including risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole, were either ineffective or intolerable.In addition to OCD, she experienced periods of depression but denied any history of mania, psychosis, trauma, or substance abuse. She reported mild hoarding symptoms but denied symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania, excoriation disorder, or an eating disorder. She reported a history of motor and phonic tics including eye blinking and blurting out words.

Randomized clinical trials indicate that ERP is (1) more effective than credible control interventions (eg, relaxation),1 (2) superior to monotherapy with clomipramine,3 and (3) superior to risperidone augmentation of an SSRI or clomipramine.4 Owing to potential adverse effects with SSRIs, practice guidelines recommend ERP as the first-line treatment for mild, uncomplicated OCD.5 However, because ERP is challenging, approximately 19% of patients with access to ERP refuse treatment or drop out prematurely.6While serotonergic medications have been the primary pharmacologic treatment for patients with OCD, evidence suggests that glutamatergic abnormalities may play a role in OCD7 (as discussed further by Dougherty et al2). Consequently, glutamate-modulating medications, such as memantine, riluzole, and the supplement N-acetylcysteine, have been investigated as potential OCD treatments generally to augment an SSRI or clomipramine. Data from these trials are inconsistent, but these interventions may benefit a subset of patients with OCD. The preliminary nature of these findings relegates these medications to third-line treatments behind conventional psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic approaches.For the small fraction of patients who have persistent, impairing OCD symptoms after evidence-based medical and psychological treatment, it may be reasonable to consider brain stimulation and/or surgical approaches that directly modulate the corticostriatal circuits believed to underlie OCD.2 Growing evidence suggests a potential role for transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of OCD when applied to these brain circuits.8 However, the modest sample sizes of recent studies limits definitive conclusions about efficacy and the optimal cortical targets for OCD. More investigation is needed before transcranial magnetic stimulation can be considered a standard OCD treatment.Patients with severe, treatment-refractory OCD may be helped by invasive surgical treatments such as capsulotomy and cingulotomy, both of which have response rates of 50% to 70% with minimal long-term cognitive adverse effects.9 Gamma knife radiosurgery has been used to replicate open capsulotomy with comparable results.9 Deep brain stimulation (DBS), the newest neurosurgical treatment for OCD, applies high-frequency electrical pulses to the white matter of the ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum at a site very close to the capsulotomy target.10 On the basis of open-label data, DBS is currently available for management of OCD under a Humanitarian Device Exemption from the Food and Drug Administration.9The patient received approximately 45 weekly ERP sessions but was unable to maintain benefits outside of ERP meetings. She was subsequently referred to a specialized intensive residential treatment program for OCD where she received ERP for 2 to 3 hours daily along with medication and group treatments. After 2 months, her score on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale dropped from 29 to 13. However, without the intensive coaching provided by the intensive residential treatment program, her symptoms began to worsen shortly after discharge.After careful consideration, a referral for DBS was initiated. After a thorough clinical assessment and review of her treatment history, she was approved for DBS surgery and underwent successful implantation of bilateral DBS electrodes targeting the ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum site. Two years after surgery, she was getting out more, was willing to hug and shake hands with loved ones she had avoided in the past, and was performing fewer decontamination rituals—improvements reflected in a 13-point drop in her Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score. Moreover, she had restarted outpatient ERP and was making good progress.",Psychiatry,"A middle-aged woman was referred to an outpatient mental health clinic for symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) following a recent hospitalization.

She denied weakness, difficulty swallowing, or breathing. On initial examination, she had a normal mental status, no pupillary abnormalities, normal visual acuity, and full visual fields. She had moderate exotropia, severe bilateral ptosis, impaired bilateral adduction and vertical ductions, and impaired convergence. Her abduction and vertical oculocephalic reflexes were intact. She had full strength and normal sensation and reflexes but had a slightly wide-based and unsteady gait. Over the subsequent weeks, she experienced worsening gait, falls, inattention, and short-term memory loss.Her brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast results were unremarkable. The test results for acetylcholine receptor antibodies and the muscle-specific kinase antibody were negative. Her electrodiagnostic test results with repetitive stimulation and single fiber electromyography were unremarkable and there was no evidence of neuropathy.

Anti-Ma2 encephalitis,D,Anti-Ma2 encephalitis,"The patient also developed seizures, hypersomnolence, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Considering a history of long-term smoking, the new onset of progressive neurologic deficits with associated abnormalities on brain MRI raised concern for a paraneoplastic etiology. Computed tomography imaging scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained, revealing multiple lung nodules. Nodule biopsy results confirmed pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Given the constellation of ocular findings that were localized to the midbrain, paroxysmal hypersomnolence, and encephalopathy, anti-Ma encephalitis was suspected, and testing for the presence of anti-Ma antibodies in the CSF revealed elevated levels of anti-Ma2 antibodies.Alternative diagnoses were considered. The combination of ophthalmoplegia, worsening mental status, and gait instability is also seen in Wernicke encephalopathy. Myasthenia gravis was also considered, although it would not explain the patient’s change in mental status or the supranuclear ocular motor findings. Likewise, Miller Fisher syndrome characteristically causes ophthalmoplegia and gait ataxia, but not changes in mental status unless in the rare circumstance that the postinfectious process also targets the central nervous system. Given the differential and progressive deterioration, the patient was empirically treated with pyridostigmine and thiamine while waiting to receive test results. However, her symptoms did not improve with the initial treatment. After a repeated brain MRI scan revealed interval changes that were concerning for an immune-mediated process, she was administered empirical intravenous methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin, after which there was a small improvement in ptosis.The patient’s ocular motor examination localized to the midbrain, particularly the central caudal subnucleus, bilateral medial longitudinal fasciculi, rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, and posterior commissure. Eye movement abnormalities, particularly vertical gaze palsies, have been described as a prominent feature of anti-Ma2 brainstem encephalitis, suggesting the disorder’s prominence in the upper brainstem.1 In addition to brainstem encephalitis, anti-Ma2 has been associated with limbic encephalitis, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, visual loss, and peripheral neuropathy.2-4 Excessive sleepiness and narcolepsy-cataplexy have also been associated with anti-Ma antibodies.1Most patients have abnormalities on brain imaging, with MRI abnormalities found primarily in the mesial temporal lobes, hypothalamus, and midbrain. Lesions are typically noted on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, sometimes with an associated contrast enhancement.1 Cerebrospinal fluid studies are also usually abnormal, commonly demonstrating elevated protein levels.3 Of patients with neuropathological studies available, many showed perivascular T cell–predominant lymphocytic infiltrates, astrocytosis, and neuronal degeneration.1,3,5,6 This reflects the hypothesis that in paraneoplastic encephalitides, such as with Ma2, the antigen is intracellular as opposed to being on the cell surface (as in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor or VGKCC-associated encephalitis), thus the pathogenic effects are cytotoxic cell–mediated rather than antibody-mediated.3,6,7 This could explain why, to our knowledge, there has been no demonstration of a significant positive association between immunotherapy and neurologic improvement in anti-Ma2 associated encephalitis.1,2 The modalities of immunotherapy that are documented in the literature include steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, plasma exchange, and cyclophosphamide.1-3This case highlights several challenges. Initially, a paraneoplastic syndrome was not highly suspected, as these are rare and the patient did not have a known malignancy. However, even after discovering lung adenocarcinoma, it was challenging to diagnose the particular immunologic response that lead to her acute neurologic decline. Anti-Ma2 paraneoplastic encephalitis is rare, and it is most often associated with testicular tumors in men.1,3 In addition, paraneoplastic encephalitides are more often associated with small-cell than with non–small-cell lung cancer, making this case particularly unique. The success of this diagnosis relied on careful consideration of the clinical presentation, the localization of examination findings, and narrowing the differential diagnosis based on targeted studies to identify the correct antibody.",Neurology,"A 70-year-old woman with long-term tobacco use presented with 2 weeks of bilateral ptosis and binocular horizontal diplopia.

Cavernous sinus syndrome,B,Cavernous sinus syndrome,"Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with and without contrast showed enlargement of the left cavernous sinus with thickening and enhancement of the left trigeminal nerve (Figure 2A), suggesting cavernous sinus syndrome as the underlying diagnosis. Cavernous sinus syndrome is characterized by some combination of ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, corneal anesthesia or facial pain, and pupillary abnormalities resulting from disruption of the third, fourth, and fifth cranial nerves (which reside along the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus) and the sympathetic plexus and sixth cranial nerve (in the medial portion of the cavernous sinus).1 The superior orbital fissure contains all the same nerves except for the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve (V2), while the orbital apex contains all the same nerves in addition to the optic nerve. Therefore, cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure syndromes are difficult to distinguish clinically, while orbital apex syndrome manifests with vision loss of varying degrees and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Thyroid eye disease  causes proptosis and ophthalmoparesis owing to enlargement of the extraocular muscles. Notably, thyroid eye disease causes eyelid retraction and not ptosis. Orbital cellulitis causes proptosis and significant swelling of the eyelids, and is characteristically very painful. This patient’s bone marrow was hypocellular. Bone marrow aspirate contained 345 cells, with 0% blasts, 6% promyelocytes/myelocytes, 51% maturing granulocyte forms, 20% erythroid forms, 16% lymphocytes, 1% plasma cells, 0% basophils/mast cells, and 0% monocytes. Flow cytometric analysis revealed no significant increase in CD34+ CD117+ myeloblasts or b-cell precursors, and there were no abnormal phenotype cells. The study results were thought to be consistent with age-appropriate marrow specimen. Cerebrospinal fluid obtained by lumbar puncture contained 43 nucleated cells per cubic millimeter (59% lymphocytes and 40% blasts [to convert to proportion of 1.0, multiply by 0.01]) and protein level of 0.143 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10); red blood cell and glucose levels were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid flow cytometry showed intermediate-sized B cells positive for CD20, CD10, CD38, and λ light chain, most of which expressed C-MYC by immunostain. The patient was diagnosed as having Burkitt lymphoma of the cavernous sinus without extracentral nervous system involvement. Treatment included induction therapy of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, and methotrexate protocol  and consolidation therapy of rituximab, cytarabine, and etoposide protocol.2 Two months following chemotherapy, ptosis, proptosis, and ophthalmoplegia had completely resolved, although the anisocoria did not fully resolve. Posttreatment cerebrospinal fluid study results showed no malignant cells, and the enhancement of trigeminal nerve was no longer seen on magnetic resonance imaging (Figure 2B). The patient remained in remission 18 months after treatment.Postcontrast T1-weighted axial magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits shows thickening and enhancement of the lateral cavernous sinus at initial presentation (A) that was no longer present after chemotherapy (B).Cavernous sinus syndrome is rare in the pediatric population. Possible underlying causes include trauma, vascular abnormalities, infections, or inflammatory diseases; neoplasm should also be considered, especially in the absence of pain.3 To our knowledge, of the 14 pediatric cases of CSS owing to lymphoma reported in the English literature, only 5 were identified as Burkitt lymphoma.4-8 In addition to being the sixth known case of CSS owing to Burkitt lymphoma, this case is singular because the diagnosis was attained exclusively by CSF analysis.",Neurology,"An 8-year-old boy presented to the pediatric emergency department with 2 weeks of fatigue and 3 days of double vision, ptosis, and painless periorbital swelling of the left eye.

Hematoxylin-eosin–stained section showing thromboembolus containing refractile foreign material (food matter, possibly plant or cartilage, at arrowhead) within a meningeal vessel (original magnification ×400).Atrioesophageal fistula is a known complication of cardiac ablation and often leads to death, with case fatality ranging from 40% to 80%.1 From 1990 to 2005, the annual incidence of atrial fibrillation increased from 270 000 to 2.2 million.2 The percentage of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing ablation procedures increased from 0.6% to 0.79%.3,4 This increase translates to 26 000 possible ablations annually; the number of cases of AEF will probably rise as well, with estimates ranging from 0.03% to 1.5%5 of ablations.There is some difference between types of ablations. Newer, less-invasive techniques, including endovascular catheter ablation and thoracoscopic surgical ablation, are increasingly used.6 Reviews comparing catheter with surgical ablation appear to demonstrate similar efficacy, although surgical ablation is associated with an increased likelihood of adverse events.6,7 Rates of adverse events are not clearly reported and limit an assessment of the risk of either procedure.7Because of the increased prevalence and high mortality associated with AEF, this consequence should be identified in a timely manner. Patients who undergo primary AEF repair are less likely to die than are those who receive conservative treatment (34% vs 83%).8 The symptoms and history associated with AEF may mimic those of bacterial endocarditis; because of this, TEE is typically obtained. However, air insufflation during TEE (or endoscopy in cases with hematemesis) can lead to air embolization and death.8,9 Therefore, a high index of suspicion is required early in the disease course to prevent iatrogenic injury or exacerbation.Findings of pneumocephalus, extensive bilateral fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion changes can lead to prompt diagnosis.

Fully treating these problem behaviors in ASD requires a careful evaluation of co-occurring medical and psychiatric disorders, developmental and family history, as well as an assessment for communication difficulties, maladaptive reinforcement patterns, and psychosocial stressors.1The 4-year-old boy described in this case had significantly impairing social communication deficits that arose early in development combined with patterns of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, the cardinal criteria of ASD (as described in DSM-5, criteria A-D). He demonstrated language impairment, motor skills delay, and suspected cognitive deficits. He also has at least 2 identifiable risk factors for a neurodevelopmental disorder: (1) premature birth and (2) 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.A careful medical evaluation in collaboration with his other clinicians ruled out medical problems that would account for his behavior. His behavior had been quite consistent over the past year and there were no recent psychosocial stressors. In the absence of other medical, psychiatric, or psychosocial factors, his behaviors most likely relate to the diagnosis of ASD with outbursts secondary to (1) deficient communication and (2) decreased tolerance for change and frustration.Behavioral intervention is first-line treatment for aggressive behavior in young children, and therapy based on the principles of applied behavior analysis has extensive empirical support in ASD. Several treatment models exist, including standard applied behavior analysis , pivotal response training, and the Early Start Denver Model. Parallel parent-training components can provide additional benefits. A functional behavioral assessment to identify triggers and understand the function of the behavior can help implement a behavioral intervention plan to decrease the target behavior, in this case, aggression and self-injury. While this patient benefitted from school-based therapies, he had not yet received applied behavior analysis –specific or other behavioral therapies at the time of evaluation. Unfortunately, access to behavioral interventions is often limited by a scarcity of trained clinicians.It is critical to evaluate the immediate safety concerns of each patient and determine whether the risk of injury to the patient or others justifies a trial of a medication to reduce the risk of injury.1 In these cases, medications should be carefully considered. Atypical antipsychotic medications have the best evidence for treating aggression and self-injurious behavior in children with ASD. Based on multiple randomized clinical trials,2 risperidone and aripiprazole were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of “irritability associated with autistic disorder” in children as young as 5 and 6 years old, respectively. The “irritability” target symptom definition was based on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability/Agitation/Crying subscale, which indexes aggression and self-injury as well as tantrums, crying, mood swings, and irritability. In any child, symptoms must be substantial to merit using this medication in the context of the potential adverse effects, which include sedation and an increased risk for movement disorders. Mixed receptor antagonists, such as risperidone and aripiprazole, are also associated with substantial weight gain and related medical problems, including type 2 diabetes. The addition of metformin has shown efficacy in reducing weight gain in children with ASD who are taking risperidone or aripiprazole.3 Some genetic conditions (including chromosome 16p11.2 deletion syndrome) are also associated with an increased risk of obesity,4 and aripiprazole may therefore be preferred over risperidone. While multiple lines of evidence point to abnormalities of the serotonin system in ASD, serotonin reuptake inhibitors do not show the same pattern of benefit in children with ASD that they provide in obsessive compulsive disorder; for example, a large randomized clinical trial of citalopram for repetitive behavior in ASD showed no overall significant benefits and increased adverse effects.5Autism spectrum disorder is an extremely heterogeneous disorder that appears to be a common final outcome of several factors, including genetic risk alleles, environmental insults, and developmental events.6 While chromosomal microarray testing can identify a clinically relevant genetic change in up to 10% of people with autism,7 in most cases we do not yet have evidence-based guidelines to clinically act on these findings. For these individuals (and those with idiopathic ASD), treatments target behavioral symptoms, such as the irritability and agitation experienced by this child.Our patient had a perinatal risk factor (prematurity) and a genetic risk factor (16p11.2 microdeletion). While there is a markedly increased risk for ASD in 16p11.2 microdeletion carriers, most do not receive a diagnosis of ASD. 16p11.2 deletion carriers are phenotypically diverse (and overlap with the nonclinical population), and they are at risk for several other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as obesity.8 Family members should always be offered genetic counseling and testing to assess whether they are carriers and to assess the recurrence risk of ASD in any siblings.The finding of a rare genomic variant in this patient could eventually open the door to a precision medicine treatment approach based on studies of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. As an illustration, mouse models of 16p11.2 deletion suggest that the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor agonist R-baclofen may improve behavior.6,9 R-baclofen affects inhibition by gamma-aminobutyric acid, which is postulated to contribute to the pathophysiology of ASD via excessive excitatory or insufficient inhibitory neurotransmission. A randomized clinical trial of R-baclofen in the general ASD population did not show improvement in irritability and agitation symptoms, although suggestive results on 2 other measures may merit a follow-up study.10",Psychiatry,"A 4-year-old boy was referred to the child psychiatry clinic for management of tantrums with aggression and self-injurious behavior.

Histopathologic testing revealed alternating orthokeratosis and parakeratosis in a checkerboard pattern and epidermal hyperplasia without neutrophilic infiltration. In combination with the clinical findings of localized plantar keratoderma (keratoderma is a group of disorders characterized by thickening of the skin with hyperkeratosis), pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) was diagnosed. Differential diagnoses, including tinea pedis and psoriasis, were ruled out based on negative fungal smear skin tests and absent neutrophilic infiltration on histopathologic examination. Juvenile plantar dermatosis was also ruled out as it frequently affects patients with atopic dermatitis and involves the weight-bearing and frictional areas of the feet, leaving toe webs spared. After treatment with oral, low-dose isotretinoin, 0.3 mg/kg/d, for 2 months, the lesions resolved significantly (Figure 2). No relapse occurred over 5 months with ongoing treatment.After treatment with oral, low-dose isotretinoin, 0.3 mg/kg/d, for 2 months, the lesions showed significant improvement.Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare papulosquamous disease with an incidence of 1 in 3500 to 5000 patients in the United States.1 Pityriasis rubra pilaris shows a bimodal age distribution, peaking in the first and fifth to sixth decades. Males and females are equally affected. Griffiths2 originally classified PRP into 5 subtypes.1 Type 1 (classic adult type, >50% of all cases) is the most common subtype characterized by follicular hyperkeratotic papules that spread in a cephalocaudal direction and often progress to a generalized erythroderma with islands of normal skin. A waxy, diffuse, yellowish keratoderma of the palms and soles, the so-called sandal appearance, may occur. This form of PRP carries the best prognosis, showing a remission rate of more than 80% within 3 years. Type 2 (atypical adult type, 5%) is characterized by a duration of 20 years or more as well as by atypical morphologic features. Follicular hyperkeratosis, as well as ichthyosiform scaling, especially on the lower limbs, dominates the clinical picture. Type 3 (classic juvenile type, 10%) seems to be the counterpart of the classic adult type (type I PRP) with the age of onset the only difference, and type 3 PRP spontaneously clears within a year. Type 4 (circumscribed juvenile type, 25%) is characterized by well-demarcated hyperkeratotic erythematous plaques limited usually to the elbows and knees with palmoplantar involvement, showing a 3-year remission rate in approximately one-third of affected patients. Type 5 (atypical juvenile type, 5%) is characterized by an early age of onset and a chronic course. It is distinguished by follicular hyperkeratosis and a scleroderma-like appearance on the hands and feet. Following the initial categorization, human immunodeficiency virus–associated PRP was added as a separate type (type 6), showing clinical features similar to those of type 1.2,3 However, the clinical spectrum of PRP could be diverse, and some cases are not neatly categorized by the classification based on age and body surface involvement.4Therapeutic options for PRP include retinoids, antimetabolites, immunosuppressive agents, antibiotics, UV phototherapy, and biologic agents.1,5 Among these treatments, systemic retinoids, such as isotretinoin, have shown the best outcomes.1,6,7 The short-term use of oral retinoids in otherwise healthy children with PRP seems to be well tolerated and safe. In previous studies, isotretinoin, at dosages of 1 to 2 mg/kg/d for 3 to 6 months, showed favorable results.6,7 More recently, alitretinoin, at dosages of 0.5 mg/kg/d, also yielded a convincing clinical response after 7 months.8 In the present case, the patient responded to low-dose isotretinoin treatment of 0.3 mg/kg/d; this could be a feasible treatment option for pediatric patients without serious adverse events.Differentiation between PRP and other diseases is important because of the difference in treatment and prognosis. The presence of follicular keratotic papules, diffuse palmoplantar keratosis, recalcitrance to topical corticosteroid treatment, and the absence of neutrophilic infiltration and alternating orthokeratosis and parakeratosis on histopathologic examination favor a diagnosis of PRP.9 A waxy erythematous palmoplantar keratoderma can also be helpful in distinguishing psoriasis (scaly and pink-red) from PRP (waxy and pink-orange).",Pediatrics,"A healthy adolescent girl presented with a prolonged dermatitis of both feet characterized by pruritus and accompanying desquamation (Figure 1).

Branchio-oto-renal syndrome,B,Branchio-oto-renal syndrome,"The skin-colored papule on the patient’s ear was consistent with an accessory tragus and the location and history of the lesion on the right lateral neck made it likely to be a branchial cleft cyst, fistula, or remnant. Based on the likely branchial cleft cyst, renal abnormalities, and ear findings, branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome was suspected. The patient underwent ultrasonography of the neck, which revealed a cutaneous tract or fistula extending to the subcutaneous tissues of the neck and likely to the hypopharynx or esophagus. Results of abdominal ultrasonography revealed small kidneys with increased echogenicity. The kidneys measured 4.3 cm and 3.9 cm in length (normal for the patient’s age, 6.2 cm). Nephrology evaluation supported the diagnosis of BOR syndrome. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were normal and no additional renal testing was completed.Branchio-oto-renal syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous developmental disorder characterized by ear, renal, and branchial anomalies. It accounts for an estimated 2% of cases of congenital deafness, with an incidence of 1 in 40 000.1 The most common features of BOR syndrome include hearing impairment, auricular malformation, branchial fistulae or cysts, preauricular sinuses or ear pits, and renal abnormalities.2 Renal anomalies range from mild hypoplasia to aplasia and agenesis.3-5 Hearing loss in BOR syndrome is progressive and may be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed.3 Some branchial anomalies are asymptomatic, but symptomatic branchial cleft fistulae often present with recurrent infections.6Major diagnostic criteria for BOR syndrome include branchial abnormalities, hearing deficit, preauricular pits, and renal abnormalities. Minor criteria include external, middle, or internal ear abnormalities; preauricular tags; facial asymmetry; and palate abnormalities. For a diagnosis of BOR syndrome, an individual must have a minimum of either 3 major criteria or 2 major criteria and 2 minor criteria.7 The diagnosis may also be considered in an individual with any of these abnormalities and a family history of possible BOR syndrome.7 Other findings reported in BOR syndrome include lacrimal duct stenosis, retrognathia, facial nerve palsy, and pancreatic duplication cysts.3,4Most often, BOR syndrome results from mutations in the EYA1 gene (OMIM 601653), located on chromosome 8, and is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern.8 Mutations in the SIX5 gene (OMIM 600963) are also associated, although much less frequently.9 Proteins encoded by the EYA1 and SIX genes form a complex that activates DNA transcription, and mutations in these genes disrupt complex formation.9 Transcription activation by the EYA1 and SIX proteins is involved in the development of fetal tissues of the second branchial arch, from which the neck, eyes, ears, and kidneys are derived. In roughly 40% of individuals meeting the criteria for BOR syndrome, EYA1 mutations are present.7 Most of these mutations can be detected by gene sequence analysis, but approximately 20% are owing to chromosomal rearrangements of EYA1 and require more advanced testing.7There have been cases of misdiagnosis of BOR syndrome as Alport syndrome, owing to clinical similarities between the 2 conditions.4 Alport syndrome is caused by defective type 4 collagen and presents during the first decade of life with hematuria, hearing loss, and ophthalmologic abnormalities.10 Hearing loss in patients with Alport syndrome tends to present during mid-childhood to late childhood rather than in infancy.10Goldenhar syndrome and papillorenal syndrome were also included in the differential. Papillorenal syndrome is characterized by optic disc dysplasia and renal hypoplasia; this diagnosis would not explain our patient’s auricular findings. Goldenhar syndrome typically presents with auricular malformations, bony spinal deformities, hemifacial microsomia, and benign growths of the eye.Families may not seek medical attention immediately if a child is not experiencing significant functional deficits secondary to the condition, as was the case with this 8-month-old patient. Cutaneous findings such as a draining papule, preauricular ear pits, and/or an accessory tragus may be clues to investigate the possibility of BOR syndrome.",Pediatrics,"An 8-month-old boy born full term presented to dermatology for evaluation of a bump on his neck that was present from birth (Figure).

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Glioma,Infarction,Germinoma,Demyelination,C. Germinoma,C,Germinoma,"Germinoma was diagnosed via stereotactic brain biopsy. Radiation therapy and subtotal resection were performed following the biopsy. Pathologically, the neoplastic infiltration was composed of large round cells with moderate amounts of clear cytoplasm and prominent vesicular nuclei with plump nucleoli resembling primordial germ cells. Immunohistochemical staining showed expression of proto-oncogene c-Kit (CD117a) by the neoplastic cells.Germinoma belongs to the class of germ cell tumors that comprise embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, and teratoma (mature and immature). Approximately two-thirds of intracranial germ cell tumors are germinomas.1 Germinomas are commonly large and circumscribed lesions, typically in the pineal or suprasellar regions, that infiltrate and compress adjacent structures, causing various clinical symptoms. Intracranial ectopic germinomas (IEGs) are tumors arising in the basal ganglia and periventricular white matter in addition to the pineal and suprasellar regions.2 Intracranial ectopic germinomas are rare, although their incidence in East Asia is higher. They have a male predominance, and most patients are younger than 20 years.3Clinical manifestation corresponding to the site and dimension of the lesions varies among patients with IEGs. The most common symptoms and signs include hemiparesis, abnormal sensation, extrapyramidal signs, and cognitive and behavioral changes.4 Signs of intracranial hypertension usually do not occur until the late stages, and most IEGs progress slowly, as observed in this patient.Human chorionic gonadotropin is an extremely sensitive and specific marker for trophoblastic tumors of placental and germ cell origin. However, the blood-brain barrier may decrease the sensitivity of serum HCG levels to intracranial germinomas. Therefore, the cerebrospinal fluid HCG level that reflects intracranial HCG secretion is more sensitive to IEGs than serum HCG level.5 In our previous study,6 the sensitivity of cerebrospinal fluid HCG level for IEGs in 14 male patients was 100%, and only 1 false-positive result was detected among 201 male control patients with nonmalignant neurological diseases.Magnetic resonance imaging has played an important role in the diagnosis of IEGs, even when serum HCG levels are normal. Compared with germinomas in other regions, the typical MRI findings, including large tumor size with mild space-occupying effect, cystic formation, calcification, and/or intratumoral bleeding, are commonly observed in IEGs,7 and almost all IEGs demonstrate irregular circular gadolinium enhancement. In addition to these typical findings, there are 2 unique neuroimaging characteristics. One is the negative space-occupying effect of the tumor and cortical/brainstem atrophy ipsilateral to the initial lesion in the early stages; this sign strongly indicates the possibility of an IEG.8 The other characteristic is the evolution of IEGs on neuroimaging from the early to late stages. In the early stages, the tumor is typically associated with only subtle abnormal signal on MRI and is similar in appearance to dilated perivascular spaces, lacunar infarcts, or demyelinating lesions. Space-occupying effects and peritumoral edema, which are common characteristics of most intracranial malignant tumors, are unusual. Susceptibility-weighted imaging has improved the sensitivity for detecting early IEGs compared with conventional MRI sequences because of its ability to demonstrate intratumoral blood products and biological metal accumulation.9 However, if patients were misdiagnosed or left untreated, large, space-occupying, multicystic, and gadolinium-enhancing tumors would appear at the site of initial lesion and/or other sites distant or even contralateral to the initial lesion in the late stages. Such dynamic neuroimaging changes can be considered specific for IEGs. Detection of IEGs is important because it is highly radiosensitive and potentially curable by radiation therapy alone, if correctly diagnosed at an early stage. Children with early-stage IEGs usually display strokelike episodes and mimic subacute lacunar infarct lesions or demyelination on conventional MRI. Advanced MRI techniques, such as susceptibility-weighted imaging, have the potential to differentiate IEGs from other diseases and can help accurately diagnose IEGs at an early stage.",Neurology,"An adolescent boy presented with cognitive and behavioral changes, headaches, and progressively worsening weakness of the left arm and leg.

Both parents were diagnosed with profound, nonprogressive sensorineural hearing loss within the first year of life.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Stickler syndrome,Waardenburg syndrome type 1,X-linked Alport syndrome,Autosomal dominant GJB2 gene mutation,B. Waardenburg syndrome type 1,B,Waardenburg syndrome type 1,"Waardenburg syndrome type 1 (WS-1) is an autosomal dominant auditory-pigmentary disorder caused by a heterozygous mutation in PAX3 gene (OMIM 606597) on chromosome 2q36. The diagnosis of WS-1 is established when 2 major clinical criteria or 1 major plus 2 minor criteria, as proposed by the Waardenburg Consortium,1 are present (Table). Genetic testing for the identification of the PAX3 pathogenic variant confirms the diagnosis. The WS-1 phenotype is extremely variable, even in the same family, owing to incomplete penetrance and variable expression of all clinical features.7 Lateral displacement of the inner canthi, termed dystopia canthorum, is observed in more than 90% of patients6,7; it manifests as fusion of the inner eyelids, leading to a reduction of the medial sclera, and can be identified using the W index, which combines the inner canthal, interpupillary, and outer canthal distances.6 Congenital sensorineural hearing loss affects 47% to 69% of patients with WS-1, which is prelingual, profound (>100 dB), and unilateral or bilateral.2-5 Owing to incomplete penetrance, hearing impairment can be present or absent even in families segregating the same mutation.8,9 Other WS-1 features are pigmentation abnormalities of the iris, hair, and skin, as reported in the Table.2-5 Differential diagnoses include other WS types and causes of syndromic hearing impairment.Three other forms of WS are known; WS-3 is allelic to WS-1, whereas WS-2 and WS-4 are genetically heterogeneous. Waardenburg syndrome type 3 differs from WS-1 for the presence of abnormalities of the upper limbs; WS-2, lack of dystopia canthorum; and WS-4, association with Hirschsprung disease.4Stickler syndrome is a connective tissue disorder with ocular, orofacial, and auditory anomalies. Myopia and vitreous abnormalities are prominent findings. Epicanthal folds can be observed, but no pigmentation anomalies are present. Hearing impairment is usually mild and progressive with age.Alport syndrome is caused by mutations of type IV collagen genes. Hearing loss due to cochlear dysfunction appears in late childhood, whereas microhematuria is always present from early childhood, evolving toward renal insufficiency with advancing age. Ocular anomalies include lenticonus and maculopathy. No facial dysmorphisms are present in the syndrome.Mutation of GJB2 is the most common cause of severe-to-profound autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. Dominant negative mutations within the GJB2 gene cause autosomal dominant inherited forms of progressive sensorineural hearing impairment. In these forms, hearing loss can be postlingual; however, no associated dymorphisms or malformations are present. GJB2 gene mutations associated with autosomal dominant hearing impairment also differ from autosomal recessive forms.This patient had 1 major (dystopia canthorum) and 3 minor (broad nasal root, small nostrils, and medial eyebrow flare) criteria of WS-1, whereas his father had 2 major (dystopia canthorum and congenital deafness) and 5 minor (leukoderma, brilliant blue irises, broad nasal root, small nostrils, and medial eyebrow flare) criteria, allowing a clinical diagnosis of the syndrome. Genetic analysis revealed the same PAX3 pathogenic mutation in both patients.After the diagnosis, the parents were informed that the child was not at increased risk of developing hearing loss and did not require repeated audiogram evaluations.5,7 Genetic counseling was provided to the parents. Because the father had a PAX3 pathogenetic variant, there is a 50% chance of recurrence of WS-1 in future children; however, recurrence of the clinical phenotype and the risk of deafness cannot be estimated.This case reminds clinicians that the WS-1 phenotype is variable even in the same family carrying the same gene defect. Dystopia canthorum is present in virtually all cases and should suggest the diagnosis. Hearing impairment affects half of individuals with the syndrome; although its recurrence cannot be estimated, knowing its congenital nature rules out the possibility of late-onset hearing loss.",Pediatrics,"A young boy and his parents presented for consultation about the child’s risk for development of hearing loss, given a family history of deafness in both parents.

She denied pruritus. Family history was significant for similar hair loss in the patient’s maternal grandmother and maternal cousin. The patient had otherwise normal development. On physical examination, short, brittle terminal hairs of varying lengths covered the entire scalp. Follicular hyperkeratosis and perifollicular erythema were present, most prominently on the parietal and occipital scalp (Figure, A). Mild perifollicular keratotic papules were noted on the posterior upper arms. Teeth and nails showed no abnormalities. Her eyebrows and lashes were not affected. Results of trichography are shown (Figure, B).Photograph of a young patient with hair loss depicts shortened, thin hairs on the scalp of a child with follicular hyperkeratosis. Light microscopy of hair shaft at 4 × magnification shows a beaded appearance.  What Is Your Diagnosis?",Tinea capitis,Psoriasis,Monilethrix,Menkes disease,C. Monilethrix,C,Monilethrix,"The term monilethrix comes from a combination of the Latin word for necklace (monile) and the Greek word for hair (thrix), referring to the alternating thin and thick areas of the hair shaft that cause the distinctive, beaded appearance on light microscopy. Monilethrix is an alopecia characterized by hair shaft fragility, hair loss, and follicular hyperkeratosis that is worse on the occipital scalp. Keratosis pilaris of the neck and arms may also be seen.1 Although generally an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance resulting from mutations on chromosome 12q13 affecting type II keratin genes such as hHb1 (KRT81 [OMIM 602153]), hHb3 (KRT83 [OMIM 602765]), or hHb6  (KRT86 [HGNC 6463]), some autosomal recessive cases have been reported, associated with mutations in desmoglein 4.1-3 Affected individuals typically have normal neonatal lanugo hair on the scalp at birth, which is shed and replaced with brittle, short hair within the first months of life. Severity varies substantially among cases, from a limited occipital distribution to diffuse involvement of eyebrows, eyelashes, secondary sexual hair, teeth, and nails.4 The diagnosis of monilethrix was confirmed in this patient after pulling several scalp hairs at the root and examining on ×4 microscopy. The characteristic beaded appearance of the hair shaft was noted (Figure, B).Although tinea capitis is a more common cause of pediatric alopecia, it is generally patchy with more prominent scaling, and a potassium hydroxide preparation revealing hyphae supports this diagnosis.5 The scalp is the most commonly affected area in children with psoriasis. Although alopecia may be seen, affected areas usually present with well-demarcated erythematous plaques with silver scale.6 Neither of these diseases are associated with beaded hair on microscopy. Microscopic examination of the kinky hair in Menkes disease can reveal findings similar to those of monilethrix, but pili torti, or twisted-appearing hair, is more common, and the disorder manifests with additional features, such as seizures, developmental delay, growth retardation, and hypopigmentation.7Other microscopic findings associated with hair fragility that should be considered include trichorrhexis invaginata, trichothiodystrophy, and trichorrhexis nodosa. Trichorrhexis invaginata, also termed bamboo hair, is seen with Netherton syndrome. These patients typically have other clinical features presenting in early life, including ichthyosis, atopy, and failure to thrive. Microscopic examination of hair shows the classic ball-and-socket appearance. Mild cases of trichothiodystrophy can present with isolated hair findings, whereas more severe cases demonstrate delayed development, intellectual disability, recurrent infections, and photosensitivity. Characteristic hair findings include transverse fractures through the hair shaft, with polarizing microscopy revealing alternating light and dark “tiger-tail” bands. Trichorrhexis nodosa is most commonly acquired through traumatic hair practices, but it also can occur as a feature of various syndromes or metabolic disorders. It is defined by a fracture of the hair shaft and gives the appearance of 2 brushes or brooms being pushed together.8Prognosis of monilethrix is variable, with possible spontaneous partial or complete recession at any age. Symptom severity has been found to improve with pregnancy, seasonally in the summer, and with increasing age.8 Although a variety of medications have been tried, such as oral and topical retinoids, oral and topical minoxidil, oral griseofulvin, and oral acetylcysteine, no treatment has shown significant or lasting efficacy. Currently, the most effective management strategy is avoiding hair trauma.8-10 After discussion of treatment options with the family and consideration of the patient’s age and possible adverse effects of systemic medications, our patient started a trial of topical tretinoin cream, 0.025%.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging during second attack: resolution of the initial left frontal lobe lesion now with T2-weighted and FLAIR recovery hyperintensity in the left parietotemporal region (C) with associated patchy enhancement (D).She presented again, 15 months later, with 2 weeks of dysarthria and progressive ataxia without change in mental status. Subsequent brain MRI revealed resolution of the prior supratentorial involvement and new T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery changes with patchy enhancement in the brainstem and a large new lesion in the left parietotemporal area (Figure, C and D). Head magnetic resonance angiography findings were unremarkable. The CSF studies revealed a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (white blood cell count of 11/µL with 3 neutrophils, 6 lymphocytes, and 2 monocytes) with 1 red blood cell, glucose level of 57 mg/dL, and total protein level of 39 g/dL. The results of the CSF viral polymerase chain reaction studies, including cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, enterovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus, were negative. The CSF bacterial culture returned without growth. The results of tests for the CSF oligoclonal bands and IgG index were negative. The patient received pulse dose corticosteroids (intravenous solumedrol, 30 mg/kg per dose every 24 hours) for 5 days with resolution of her truncal ataxia during hospitalization. She was discharged with a month-long oral prednisone taper starting at 20 mg/d. When tapered down to prednisone, 5 mg every other day, she developed a right facial droop with recurrent ataxia.

Autoimmune encephalitis,C,Autoimmune encephalitis,"At initial presentation, the patient was diagnosed with ADEM and treated accordingly with resolution of symptoms. During her second presentation, 15 months later, her condition did not fit the diagnosis of multiphasic ADEM given the lack of mental status changes. Multiple sclerosis was considered less likely because of the atypical MRI lesions, lack of CSF oligoclonal bands, and normal IgG index; however, multiple sclerosis (MS) remained on the differential diagnosis as the most common relapsing demyelinating disease in the US population. Central nervous system lymphoma and neurosarcoidosis remained in the differential diagnosis given the strong response to high-dose corticosteroids. Additional workup was performed during her second presentation, with unremarkable chest radiographic findings. Whole-body positron emission tomography and additional CSF studies with cytology and flow cytometry were recommended but deferred by the patient’s family.On the basis of the relapsing clinical course, CSF pleocytosis, and lesion appearance, there was concern about autoimmune encephalitis, and a Mayo Clinic encephalitis panel was performed, the results of which were negative. Anti–myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody was measured separately during her second presentation, and the results were positive without a specified titer.The MOG antibody has been historically identified in a variety of neuroinflammatory conditions, including MS, ADEM, neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorders, relapsing and bilateral optic neuritis, and transverse myelitis. MOG is a type 1 transmembrane protein present on oligodendrocytes and the exterior surface of myelin sheaths.1 Antibodies against MOG are thought to facilitate complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro and can precipitate an NMO-like syndrome in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis mouse models.2-4 Recently, the MOG assay specificity was improved by eliminating nonspecific IgM binding using IgG1 secondary antibodies.5 With the improved assay, MOG antibodies are enriched in patients with NMO spectrum disorder who test negative for the anti–aquaporin 4 antibody.6MOG autoimmune encephalitis lies on the spectrum between aquaporin 4 antibody–seronegative negative NMO and MS. Clinical features of relapsing attacks on myelin in the brain overlap with MS presentations, whereas severe optic neuritis and transverse myelitis mimic NMO. In children, MOG encephalitis can also present as multiphasic ADEM. Uniform brain MRI changes are seen in children with anti-MOG and ADEM. The lesions are characteristically large and hazy, with ill-defined boundaries that involve the cortices, deep gray matter, cerebellum, or brainstem.7,8 In contrast to this patient’s large unilateral lesions, MOG and ADEM lesions are often bilateral. There is also an increased frequency of longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions, similar to NMO. In most cases, MRI changes resolve on subsequent imaging, similar to MS and NMO.9 MOG-seropositive children have a better clinical recovery and are less likely to fulfill diagnostic criteria for MS in the future compared with seronegative children.8As described in our case report, MOG-seropositive children can exhibit a robust response to corticosteroids in the acute care setting, with significant relapse when corticosteroids are tapered or withdrawn.7 In such a situation, maintenance immunosuppression may be necessary. Given this patient’s relapsing course, immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil was chosen. Despite mycophenolate therapy, she continued to have recurrence of symptoms with corticosteroid tapering, required transition to rituximab, and currently remains asymptomatic.This case is important in illustrating that anti-MOG–associated autoimmune encephalitis can initially present with atypical, unilateral lesions that may mimic multiphasic ADEM, NMO, MS, neurosarcoidosis, and malignant tumors, such as central nervous system lymphoma. Establishing anti-MOG seropositivity is critical in determining appropriate treatment. Future studies are needed to determine the importance of anti-MOG antibodies in the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease.",Neurology,"A young girl with an unremarkable medical history presented with 1 week of drowsiness, double vision, and left cranial nerve VI and VII palsies.

Angiokeratoma,C,Angiokeratoma,"Dermoscopy results did not reveal any discrete pigment network, which decreased our suspicion for a melanocytic lesion. Nevertheless, the patient and family opted for excision of the lesion, and histopathology results demonstrated markedly dilated vascular spaces in the papillary dermis with delicate endothelial lining and scattered erythrocytes in the lumen. The clinical and histopathologic findings were most consistent with an angiokeratoma.Angiokeratomas are rare, benign vascular lesions composed of ectatic capillary vessels in the superficial dermis that may be associated with prior trauma or injury. Solitary angiokeratomas account for 70% to 83% of all angiokeratomas and typically arise in the third or fourth decade of life on the lower extremities, but angiokeratomas can also present at birth or during childhood in many anatomic locations.1,2 Widespread lesions on the trunk and inguinal regions should prompt screening for underlying disorders such as Fabry disease, a rare X-linked recessive genetic disorder that is caused by the absence of α-galactosidase A that results in the progressive multiorgan failure of the central nervous system, heart, and kidneys.Angiokeratomas present as dark red, purple, or black firm, hyperkeratotic papules or verrucous nodules that are 1 to 10 mm.3 They are usually asymptomatic, but can present with pain in 14% of cases or bleeding in 25% of cases, leading to concern for the development of malignant melanoma.1,4,5 Dermoscopy can be a helpful tool for distinguishing an angiokeratoma from a malignant melanocytic lesion. Common dermoscopic features of angiokeratomas include vascular (purple or red) lacunae and associated erythema.6 In addition, the absence of a pigment network on dermoscopy significantly decreases suspicion for a melanocytic lesion. Distinguishing between the 2 entities is important because of marked differences in management and prognosis.Pediatricians may not have dermoscopy resources on hand, but other useful clinical features may assist them in evaluating these lesions. There can be marked variation in the morphology of angiokeratomas at different points in time, as seen in the Figure. Substantial variation in clinical appearance after certain activities, such as taking a shower, exercise, or trauma, is also less consistent with a melanocytic nevus. On physical examination, the presence of fluid-filled vesicles or overlying thin or thick scale is consistent with the diagnosis of an angiokeratoma. However, both angiokeratomas and malignant melanomas can bleed, change in color, and grow, so when in doubt, urgent referral to a dermatology service is appropriate.Treatment modalities for solitary angiokeratomas include excision, cautery, and laser therapy. The lesion on this patient was removed with excision, without complications. When there are multiple or more extensive lesions, excision is a less desirable treatment modality, and other therapeutic options, like laser therapy, may be considered. For Fabry disease, early recognition of skin findings is crucial as enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant α-galactosidase A can result in the cessation or reversal of disease progression.In this patient, the rapid evolution of the lesion led to suspicion for melanoma, especially given the strong family history of dysplastic nevi and melanoma. However, clinical features, including the variation in size and color after exercise or activity, overlying thin or thick scale, and/or small vesicles, should prompt practicing pediatricians to consider angiokeratoma in their differential diagnosis of a rapidly changing skin lesion.",Pediatrics,"A 16-year-old boy presented with a changing skin lesion on his right lower back.

Vitamin A deficiency,B,Vitamin A deficiency,"This patient’s diagnosis was made based on a history of a limited diet and classic findings of xerophthalmia (severe dry eye) and Bitot spots on ophthalmologic examination. His vitamin A level (drawn on presentation) was 14.33 μg/dL (normal range, 25.79-48.71; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.0349).Typical food sources for vitamin A include various plant/animal sources, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, dark leafy green vegetables, fish, liver, and butter/margarine.1 Vitamin A deficiency is generally a result of poor dietary intake and represents a major cause of preventable childhood blindness. Vitamin A deficiency is generally thought of as a disease that primarily affects people in low-resource environments, such as countries in the developing world, where food choices are limited and malnutrition is endemic.2 Current guidelines recommend regular supplementation at various doses based on age in populations at risk for vitamin A deficiency. These steps have been shown in clinical trials to decrease all-cause and diarrhea-related mortality as well as morbidity associated with measles infections.3 Xerophthalmia describes the conjunctival xerosis (dryness), keratinization, and heaping of material, with the creation of Bitot spots, characteristic of vitamin A deficiency (Figure 1A). These findings are the natural response to exposure of the conjunctiva to dry conditions. This can be a result of various conditions associated with abnormal eyelid closure or lacrimal gland dysfunction (eg, vitamin A deficiency or Sjögren syndrome). Nonocular manifestations of vitamin A deficiency include growth restriction and relative immune deficiency.Vitamin A is also essential for vision by allowing normal functioning of photoreceptors. Vitamin A is particularly important for the function of rhodopsin (the photosensitive pigment in rod cells). As such, visual impairment predominantly affects night vision. However, as this patient demonstrates, cone photoreceptors may also become affected in severe deficiencies with loss of normal vision. Vitamin A, in the form of retinol, undergoes a series of biochemical changes, which results in the conduction of nerve impulses along the optic nerve, affecting the perception of light and color. In general, a serum retinol level less than 20.06 μg/dL is considered low; however, clinical correlates are essential.1The patient started receiving megadoses of vitamin A, consisting of 200 000 IU daily for 2 days followed by a third dose 2 weeks later based on the findings of xerophthalmia and vision loss, along with his limited intake of foods rich in vitamin A. This is the standard of care presented by the World Health Organization for treatment of vitamin A deficiency associated with xerophthalmia.4 Follow-up examination 6 weeks after vitamin A supplementation showed major improvements. Visual acuity improved to 20/800 bilaterally, and the xerophthalmia with Bitot spots resolved (Figure 2). Vision loss associated with vitamin A deficiency can be reversible; however, in cases with established optic atrophy, as was the case in this patient, a degree of vision loss is likely permanent.5 This patient illustrates the importance of considering micronutrient deficiencies in high-resource settings, particularly in persons for which a diet rich in various food sources is not evident, such as children with highly restrictive diets.

Urinalysis, serum amyloid, and audiometric test results were normal. Ophthalmologic examination revealed an absence of papilledema and uveitis. The patient underwent an evaluation for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes because of the presence of fever, arthritis, and urticaria as an infant. Genetic analysis revealed a T348M mutation of the NLRP3 (formerly CIAS1) gene. The child was diagnosed with MWS (OMIM #191900).The cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes or cryopyrinopathies are a group of rare, inherited, autoinflammatory disorders of interleukin 1–associated regulation.1 These syndromes occur because of genetic mutations in the NLRP3 gene (OMIM *606416), which encodes cryopyrin, a protein that regulates inflammation. Mutations in this gene result in unregulated production of interleukin 1, leading to symptoms of inflammation such as fever and arthralgias.1,2Cryopyrinopathies include the following 3 subtypes: MWS, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder.1,2 Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome is characterized by intermittent urticaria, fever, and arthritis triggered by exposure to cold temperatures. Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder has the most severe phenotype and presents in infancy as a systemic inflammatory condition with fever, arthritis, urticaria, and central nervous system disease.1,2First described in 1962, MWS is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. Symptoms start in infancy and early childhood, and the disease is characterized by recurrent nonpruritic urticaria with periodic fevers. Fevers occur at irregular intervals every few weeks, last 24 to 48 hours, and resolve spontaneously. Symptoms can be precipitated by stress, exercise, and cold or heat exposure. Arthralgia can affect any joint, but bony destruction is not usually seen. Conjunctivitis occurs with flares of the disease.1,2The main complications of MWS include sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and progressive amyloidosis. Inflammation within the cochlea or leptomeninges may be related to SNHL. Bilateral SNHL has been described in up to 85% of patients with MWS. The SNHL begins during early adolescence and often starts at high frequencies but can rapidly progress to profound hearing loss.3,4 Deposition of amyloid in the kidneys and liver also contributes to the MWS morbidity.1,2Confirmation of the diagnosis is achieved through genetic testing and identification of an NLRP3 mutation. Studies have detected cases of somatic mosaicism of the NLRP3 gene in individuals with clinical findings of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, without evidence of the genetic mutation on the standard genetic tests.5 Histopathologic analysis of skin lesions shows perivascular and interstitial, mixed-inflammatory infiltrate of plasma cells, histiocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells.6Currently, there is no cure for the cryopyrinopathies. Treatment involves use of agents that target interleukin 1, such as rilonacept, canakinumab, and anakinra7,8 Most patients have a normal life span, and the development of complications such as amyloidosis and SNHL is rare with treatment. However, routine audiological monitoring is recommended for all patients with MWS; early detection and management of hearing loss is important for speech, language, and social development. Traditional screening pediatric audiograms test for standard frequencies only. Hence, comprehensive otolaryngologic assessments should include testing of high-frequency hearing thresholds.4,5 Our patient was successfully treated with anakinra injection medication and has been doing well. She currently has no disease complications.This case highlights the importance of investigating MWS as a possible diagnosis for infants with recurrent fevers and urticaria.

Neurocutaneous melanosis,C,Neurocutaneous melanosis,"The key to the correct diagnosis is the location of the multiple intracranial parenchymal lesions, the 10-year history, and the presence of multiple large congenital nevi, suggesting the diagnosis of neurocutaneous melanosis. Neurocutaneous melanosis (NM) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the presence of large or multiple congenital cutaneous nevi along with intracranial leptomeningeal melanocytosis.1 The diagnosis of this disease is quite difficult. Criteria proposed by Fox and revised by Kadonaga and Frieden2 are as follows: large or multiple (≥3) congenital nevi associated with meningeal melanosis; no evidence of cutaneous melanoma; and no evidence of meningeal melanoma except in patients whose skin examination reveals no malignant lesions.2,3 Although an experienced physician may associate the intracranial tumors with melanocytic ones in view of the multiple congenital nevi over the body, there is no way to determine the nature of the tumors and make the diagnosis without biopsy and pathological examinations. In this case, robotic frameless stereotactic biopsy of the lesions in the left temporal lobe and in the third ventricle was performed. As revealed by hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistological stainings, the lesions were melanocytic in origin. Also, the lesions showed strong immunoreactivity to markers related to melanocytic tumors including Vimentin, S100, HMB45, and Melan A. Considering that there is no evidence of melanoma elsewhere and the 10-year history, metastatic melanocytic tumors are excluded. Moreover, the multiorigination, the correspondence of the original sites (bilateral mesial temporal lobe and the brainstem) to the most frequent sites of the leptomeningeal involvement of NM,4-6 and the involvement of N-ras-2 gene3,7 are all typical characteristics of NM. Therefore, the diagnosis of NM can be established based on the previously mentioned criteria.2Our case is interesting because the 10-year disease history is, to our knowledge, the longest in patients with NM. In addition, our case revealed the evolvement of the intracranial part of NM, which is different from the previous description of transition from meningeal melanocytoma to primary cerebral melanoma.8,9 The rapid progression of the lesions in the left temporal lobe and the third ventricle within a year showed the heterogeneity of the tumors and the malignant transformation potential. The newly developed lesion in the third ventricle that led to hydrocephalus showed high malignancy with a Ki-67 rate of more than 60%.The patient in this case underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement to address hydrocephalus as soon as the diagnosis was confirmed. Although there is no special treatment with definite efficacy to NM,10 a concurrent chemoradiotherapy (temozolomide, 4-week, 200 mg/m2 daily) was conducted to contain the tumor. Four months later, multiple subdural extramedullary masses were found by MRI on the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral levels.

Still, adverse reactions are common, with 1 study finding that 38.3% of children receiving a hepatitis B vaccine had local redness and swelling and 6.7% showed bruising.1 Serious reactions such as tissue necrosis are rarer.Nicolau syndrome is a clinical diagnosis described as livedoid dermatitis (embolia cutis medicamentosa) at the site of injection accompanied by inflammation and ischemic necrosis of the skin and underlying tissue. Both adipose and muscle tissue can be involved. Biopsy of affected tissue is nonspecific and shows ischemic necrosis.2 A hallmark of the syndrome is intense pain at the injection site shortly after the injection, followed by hemorrhagic patches with formation of a livedoid purpura and then the development of tissue necrosis.3,4 Nicolau syndrome is known to be more common in children, especially younger than age 3 years, but it can happen at any age.4,5In its most severe course, Nicolau syndrome can lead to superinfection with pseudomonas, compartment syndrome, or irreversible necrosis. Other possible sequelae, such as paralysis, renal failure, and death, have also been reported.4 About 30% of patients can have hypoesthesia in the affected area.4Several different medications given by means of intramuscular injection have been known to cause Nicolau syndrome including penicillin, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and others. It was first described in the 1920s following Bismuth injections for the management of syphilis.3,6Although the pathogenesis of Nicolau syndrome and other similar reactions are not understood, several possible explanations exist. Some researchers have hypothesized that the instramuscular injection itself is more the culprit than the medication injected,3 while others believe the opposite. Thrombosis formation secondary to accidental intra-arterial or intravenous injection and perivascular injection leading to vasospasm are 2 leading theories. Other thoughts include perivascular inflammation from direct cytotoxicity of the medication or crystallization of the drug out of solution causing vascular occlusion.4,7The treatment of patients with Nicolau syndrome focuses on managing the impactful sequelae. Compartment syndrome requires fasciotomy, and extensive necrosis may require surgical debridement or even amputation. Superinfection requires intravenous  antibiotics. Some experts have advocated using anticoagulants, steroids, and/or hyperbaric oxygen; however, to our knowledge, these treatments have not been well studied.4,8The only known way to reduce the risk of Nicolau syndrome is to aspirate the needle before injecting to ensure the injection is indeed intramuscular and not intravenous or intra-arterial.2 When alternatives are available, avoidance of the intramuscular route of administration should be considered.",Pediatrics,"A previously healthy 15-year-old boy presented to our hospital with pain and purpura of his left thigh after an intramuscular injection in that leg. Ten days prior, he had presented to a referring hospital’s emergency department for nausea and vomiting and was given 20 mg of intramuscular dicyclomine. He reported severe pain at the time and site of injection. Within a few hours, he noticed swelling and purpura overlying the site of injection.Over the next 2 weeks, the swelling persisted and the purpura intensified, becoming black centrally (Figure A and B). Pain worsened over this period, initially restricting use of the leg, then preventing any weight bearing, prompting his admission to our hospital 10 days after the injection.

Herpes simplex virus,D,Herpes simplex virus,"A bedside Tzanck smear demonstrated numerous multinucleated giant cells. Intravenous acyclovir, dosing at 20 mg/kg every 8 hours, was promptly initiated. A skin biopsy from the extremity demonstrated necrotic ulceration, with dyskeratotic keratinocytes containing intranuclear herpes viral inclusions. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) group was isolated from a viral skin culture, and a blood serum polymerase chain reaction result was positive for HSV2 DNA. The lumbar puncture had a positive polymerase chain reaction for HSV2 DNA, high total protein count, and xanthochromia. The respiratory sputum additionally affirmed the presence of HSV. Ophthalmology consultation deemed no ocular involvement. Intravenous acyclovir was continued for 3 weeks before transitioning to a 6-month oral course of acyclovir 300 mg/m2, divided into 3 times daily, on discharge.This case highlights the presentation of neonatal disseminated HSV, with the infant exhibiting respiratory distress and characteristic skin vesicles. There are approximately 1500 cases of neonatal HSV annually in the United States.1,2 Three primary mechanisms for transmission include intrauterine (5%), peripartum (85%), and postnatal (10%).3,4 Most intrauterine infection is caused by HSV2, supporting the role of an ascending maternal infection.4 Viral exposure before 20 weeks can lead to spontaneous abortion or congenital anomalies involving the skin and central nervous system. Peripartum infection is the most common, owing to exposure to secretions in the birth canal.4 Risk factors for peripartum transmission include maternal antibody status, premature prolonged rupture of membranes, use of fetal scalp monitors, and vaginal delivery.1,5 However, most neonates are born to mothers without known risk factors.6 Postnatal infection may be acquired from family members or health care workers.Disseminated HSV is defined as visceral organ involvement in addition to or other than ocular or central nervous system disease.3,4 Delay in diagnosis of HSV, particularly central nervous system or disseminated disease, can have devastating consequences including long-term neurologic impairment or death. Unfortunately, characteristic lesions of HSV infection can be subtle, absent, or atypical in many cases.7-9 The initial site of skin involvement is frequently the area that first comes into contact with maternal lesions, such as the face for a cephalic presentation or the buttocks and extremities for breech presentation, as in this case. The cutaneous manifestations may lag behind visceral involvement.4 Notably, neonates may present with respiratory distress as the primary manifestation of disease, with nonspecific opacities on chest radiograph, as demonstrated in this patient.6,10 Although there are a myriad of causes of neonatal respiratory distress including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, disseminated HSV should be included on the differential list.For diagnosis, a Tzanck prep and cutaneous biopsy should be performed. The nature of the primary lesion determines the sensitivity of the Tzanck with vesicular lesions more likely to be positive (67%) than pustules (55%) or ulcers (17%).4 Viral cultures of the skin, conjunctiva, pharynx, and cerebrospinal fluid should be performed but should not delay treatment. Polymerase chain reaction of the serum or cerebrospinal fluid is considered the gold standard of diagnosis for disseminated disease. A low threshold should ensue for evaluating the pulmonary status with a chest radiograph.6,10 The most common associated laboratory abnormalities include transaminitis, an elevated C-reactive protein, and thrombocytopenia.6 Other pustular eruptions common in the neonatal period include erythema toxicum neonatorum and transient neonatal pustular melanosis, presenting characteristically in healthy neonates; infectious etiologies include candidiasis, scabies, and bullous syphilis, with potassium hydroxide, mineral oil prep, and laboratory evaluation helping to differentiate among the latter causes.Disseminated disease requires an extended 21 days of intravenous therapy.3,4 After intravenous dosing, suppressive oral acyclovir should be given for a total duration of 6 months.3,4 For mothers with a known history of herpes infection, suppressive therapy at 36 weeks of gestation is recommended. Overall, the morbidity associated with primary HSV in the neonate is substantial, ranging from 30% to 50%.2 Delay in treatment results in significant morbidity and mortality. Disseminated HSV is an important differential for neonates in respiratory distress with or without skin lesions. Prompt initiation of empirical acyclovir therapy can be lifesaving and can prevent neurologic and fatal consequences.",Pediatrics,"A 3-day-old premature male infant, born at 26 weeks’ gestational age, presented to the dermatology department with a skin rash on the bilateral lower extremities.

These findings were consistent with dyshidrotic eczema. The patient started topical mometasone, 0.1%, ointment, but owing to lack of improvement, oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/d was added to her regimen. At her 3-week follow-up, no new blisters were seen, and all previous lesions were healing (Figure 2). Postprednisone treatment. Bilateral palmar surfaces with areas of erythema and mild desquamation at locations of previous lesions.Dyshidrotic eczema is a vesiculobullous disease of the palms and soles. It can be idiopathic or related exposure to contact allergens.1 Dyshidrotic eruptions are a known adverse effect of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. It can be exacerbated by hyperhidrosis. Dyshidrotic eczema can present as a severe, sudden outbreak of intensely pruritic deep-seated vesicles.2 The lesions resemble “tapioca” but may coalesce to form bullae. The eruption typically presents symmetrically on the lateral aspects of the fingers as well as the palms and soles.2 In chronic cases, lesions may appear hyperkeratotic and fissured. Most patients experience flares throughout their life; however, decreased frequency and severity may occur with age. Relapses are more common in those with atopy, sweat gland disorderes, or occupational exposure to triggers. Flares can range in intensity from mild to severe, occur at variable intervals, and persist for several weeks.2Diagnosis is often clinical; however, an appropriate initial workup must be performed to exclude processes that can cause a similar clinical presentation such as bullous tinea, bacterial infection, autoimmune bullous disease, and allergic contact dermatitis.2 Skin scraping with potassium hydroxide can be performed to look for fungal hyphae seen in bullous tinea. Exudative bacterial culture swab should be performed because bacterial superinfection can distort typical clinical presentations of other disease entities or be the primary cause of bulla, as seen in distal blistering dactylitis. In cases with diagnostic uncertainty, a tissue biopsy with direct immunofluorescence can be performed to rule out autoimmune bullous disease.2 Patch testing is considered if allergic contact dermatitis is suspected.Adequate treatment for dyshidrotic eczema is not only important for functionality and quality of life but also to restore the skin’s barrier function and prevent complications such as bacterial and viral superinfections. First-line therapy includes a topical corticosteroid. Mometasone furoate has been shown to be safe and effective, where most patients noted resolution of their flare within 9 weeks and had continued remission when used as maintenance.3Alternate options for topical therapy include other superpotent or potent topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus or pimecrolimus), both of which have produced beneficial results comparable with mometasone treatment in 1 study.4 Calcineurin inhibitors have the benefit of not causing similar adverse effects as seen with corticosteroids and can be used for rotational therapy with topical corticosteroids.4In more severe cases warranting oral therapy, such as this one, systemic glucocorticoids can be administered with a gradual taper initiated once blisters resolve.2 If lesions are recalcitrant, steroid-sparing agents, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil, can be used to induce and maintain remission.2,5-7 Lastly, phototherapy, using high-dose ultraviolet A light, soak or cream psoralen-ultraviolet-light, or oral psoralen-ultraviolet-light may be indicated for appropriate patients.8 Diagnosis and treatment of dyshidrotic eczema can lead to significantly improved quality of life, as seen in this patient. Dyshidrotic eczema eruptions can have a variety of presentations and should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient presenting with an acral vesiculobullous eruption.",Pediatrics,"A young girl presented to the pediatric emergency department for evaluation of blisters on both of her hands.

Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis,A,Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis,"Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is an uncommon condition characterized by the rapid onset of multiple, pinpoint, nonfollicular-based pustules on an erythematous, edematous background.1 Skin biopsy demonstrates the presence of subcorneal, intracorneal, and intraepidermal pustules, necrotic keratinocytes, and epidermal spongiosis.2The incidence of AGEP is estimated to be 1 to 5 cases per million per year. It typically affects middle-aged women and is uncommon in children. In most cases, AGEP is attributed to an adverse cutaneous drug eruption.1,3 However, in approximately 10% of cases, no causative drug is found, and a bacterial or viral infection may be a precipitant.3 In addition to its cutaneous manifestations, other clues include the presence of fever and leukocytosis. Mucosal involvement may occur, and systemic involvement occurs in up to 17% of patients.1,4 The liver and kidneys are the most commonly involved visceral organs and may be associated with an increased absolute neutrophil count and elevated C-reactive protein levels.4Antibiotics are the most commonly implicated drugs, particularly β lactam, quinolone, and sulfa antibiotics. Other implicated agents include antimalarials and antifungals.3 Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis can often be distinguished from other cutaneous reactions by the time to onset from initiation of the causative drug. The median exposure time is 24 hours for AGEP associated with antibiotics, and it is rare for symptoms to occur more than 15 days after the causative drug is initiated.5 This time frame is unlike Stephens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (7-21 days) and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (2-4 weeks).6Other causes of pustular eruptions must be excluded. These include pustular psoriasis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, and deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist syndrome.Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and pustular psoriasis are clinically similar. A personal or family history of psoriasis or a history of new medication is useful in distinguishing them. Histologically, the presence of eosinophils, necrotic keratinocytes, mixed interstitial and middermal perivascular infiltrate, and the absence of tortuous or dilated blood vessels support a diagnosis of AGEP over pustular psoriasis.7As with AGEP, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome can present with fever, irritability, and abrupt onset of pustules and bullae with well-demarcated erythema and skin exfoliation. Unlike in AGEP, Nikolsky sign is positive, and the skin is tender. Histologically, there is separation of the superficial epidermis beginning at the granular layer; necrotic keratinocytes are absent. Cultures of the nasopharynx may be positive for Staphylococcus aureus.8Deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist syndrome is a rare disease characterized by constitutive interleukin-1 signaling. Infants present shortly after birth with localized or generalized pustular eruptions, oral ulcers, and nail pitting or onychomadesis. Systemic symptoms include joint swelling and bony abnormalities. Skin biopsy reveals acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and an epidermal and dermal neutrophilic infiltrate.9Although AGEP is typically associated with an excellent prognosis, it does have a mortality rate of up to 5%. Patients who have multiple comorbidities and extensive mucous membrane involvement are at higher risk of mortality.3Treatment involves prompt discontinuation of the offending drug, supportive therapy with moist dressings, and monitoring patients for the development of a superimposed bacterial infection. The use of topical steroids may be associated with shorter hospitalizations. Oral corticosteroids are sometimes used, but to our knowledge, no randomized clinical trials have been conducted, and the benefits remain unclear.3 Unless the patient is in poor health or has widespread mucosal involvement, one may expect spontaneous resolution of symptoms within 15 days.1 Recurrent AGEP has been reported on re-exposure to the causative drug; however, the frequency of such recurrences is unknown. Experts recommend that physicians choose structurally different drugs to minimize the chance of recurrence.10",Pediatrics,"An 18-month-old boy with a history of atopic dermatitis presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of high fever and rash that began 2 days after completing an 8-day course of clindamycin for sinusitis.On presentation, the child was lethargic and fussy, with a temperature of 38.1°C.

Together, with multiple enlarged lymph nodes, the diagnosis was narrowed down to a group of diseases, including tubercular meningomyelitis, neurosarcoidosis, lymphoma, metastatic disease, and mycotic meningomyelitis. The quadriplegia quickly deteriorated despite a standard antituberculosis regimen, and results from blood testing for tuberculosis were negative. Neurosarcoidosis can have spinal manifestations, but abnormalities of the cranial nerves are the most common. In patients with systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lymphomatous involvement of the leptomeninges can be seen; in such cases, patients usually respond well to corticosteroids. No indications of malignancy could be identified. Therefore, given the history of exposure to moist dust and the presence of subcutaneous abscess beneath the pigmentation on the back, fungal infection was more likely.Further testing showed that plasma (1-3)-β-D-glucan was elevated to 578.2 pg/mL (normal range, <60 pg/mL). An open biopsy of cervical lymphonode revealed necrotic lymph node structure with numerous multinucleated giant cells and dematiaceous fungal materials in the form of spores and hyphaes. A fungal culture of the pus extracted from the subcutaneous abscess beneath the pigmentation showed entangled black hyphae (Figure 2). Sequencing analysis of the isolate revealed a high degree of homology to Fonsecaea (F pedrosoi, F monophora, and F compacta).

In this patient, the mycosis lesions appeared to be of leptomeningeal origin with parenchymal invasion. Mycotic infection of the central nervous system (ie, phaeohyphomycosis) is typically caused by one of the following pathogens: Cladophialophora bantiana, Exophiala dermatitidis, or Rhinocladiella mackenziei.1 On the contrary, infection by F monophora or F pedrosoi is typically confined to the skin and subcutaneous tissue (chromoblastomycosis).2-4 Deep tissue is involved only in rare cases.5 Brain phaeohyphomycosis caused by Fonsecaea has only been reported in several case reports, whereas spinal cord involvement was even rarer.6,7 Notably, unlike other life-threatening mold infections, roughly half of patients with central nervous system phaeohyphomycosis were reported in apparently immune-competent individuals, possibly owing to melanin in the cell walls of Chaetothyriales as a key virulence factor for central nervous system localization.7 The diagnosis could have been established earlier in this patient with a more careful physical examination of the skin lesions.",Neurology,"A 30-year-old man was referred with progressive quadriplegia for 2 months.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Herpes simplex virus infection,Mucocele,Neurofibromatosis type 1,Oral lymphangioma,D. Oral lymphangioma,D,Oral lymphangioma,"Lymphangiomas are benign, hamartomatous tumors of lymphatic vessels. Oral lymphangiomas most commonly affect the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.1 Lesions may also affect the palate, gingiva, buccal mucosa, and lips.2 In addition to cosmetic deformity, comorbidities may include hemorrhage, excessive salivation, speech disturbances, difficulty chewing or swallowing, airway obstruction, and orthodontic abnormalities.3 The characteristic appearance is of multiple lymph-filled cysts, which may be clear, white, red, blue, or purple, representing various stages of granulation as well as capillary rupture into the lymphatic space. Deeper lesions may not appear discolored at all. These masses are typically classified as microcystic (lesions smaller than 2 cm3) or macrocystic (lesions larger than 2 cm3). Histologically, lymphangiomas are composed of thin-walled, cystically dilated vascular channels lined by endothelial cells and filled with proteinaceous fluid.4 As with this patient, lesions often regress and recur spontaneously, although definitive treatment typically involves surgical intervention, particularly in cases of airway obstruction, obstructive sleep apnea, recurrent tongue trauma, bleeding, or pain.4 Prior to treatment, advanced imaging is recommended to determine the extent of the lesions, with magnetic resonance imaging being the preferred modality. However, surgical excision is frequently incomplete, resulting in residual disease and high rate of recurrence.5 Other techniques, such as low radiofrequency ablation and sclerotherapy, have been found to be effective in case series.5-7The differential diagnosis for oral lymphangioma includes other congenital malformations, infectious masses, and neoplasms. Congenital malformations, such as arteriovenous malformations, branchial cleft cysts, and mucoceles, may also present with oral lesions. Mucoceles are cysts resulting from the extravasation of mucin from nearby salivary glands. They are anatomically located at the base of the tongue rather than on the anterior surface, as in this patient. The patient does not have other symptoms that suggest an infectious etiology, such as fever or rhinorrhea, and the absence of associated pain makes herpes simplex and varicella virus infection unlikely. Neurofibromatosis type 1 can rarely present with multiple tongue lesions, often representing fleshy neurofibromas along peripheral nerves, but the vesicular nature of the lesions, the recurrent history of the masses, and the lack of other stigmata of neurofibromatosis type 1 makes this diagnosis unlikely.For this patient, the diagnosis of oral lymphangioma was made based on history and physical examination. He had no signs of airway obstruction. He was discharged home from the emergency department with referrals to dermatology and otolaryngology clinics. Outpatient workup included computed tomography of the neck to evaluate the presence of other masses that could potentially compromise his airway. Owing to the recurrent nature of these masses, the patient underwent elective ablation and sclerotherapy with injected bleomycin; despite these interventions, his lymphangiomas continue to recur and he follows up regularly with an otolaryngology clinic.",Pediatrics,"A 7-year-old healthy boy presented to the emergency department with recurrent painless tongue masses since birth.

Although these symptoms had resolved after 3 hours’ rest, they recurred 2 hours prior to hospital admission. In addition, the patient had begun to experience weakness and numbness of his limbs, with more severe symptoms on the right side. The symptoms began to gradually resolve 2 hours following admission, and normal function had returned within 2 days. No significant history of illness was noted in the patient or among family members.Neurological examination on admission revealed normal mental status, and the results of cranial nerve examination were normal. Although the patient had cavus feet, no atrophy was observed in the distal lower limbs (Figure, A). Muscle strength was classified as grade 4 for the left limbs and grade 3 for the right limbs, according to Medical Research Council criteria, and muscle tone was diminished. The sensory examination was unremarkable. Deep reflexes were diminished or absent. However, bilateral positive Babinski signs were observed.

X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1,D,X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1,"Periodic paralysis and transient ischemic attack (TIA) were initially considered. However, levels of serum electrolytes were normal during episodes, and dysarthria and dysphagia are not causal symptoms of periodic paralysis. Diagnosis of TIA seemed reasonable for the transient weakness of limbs and bulbar muscles owing to complete restoration of function after episodes. However, TIA cannot explain the diminished or absent tendon reflex, as well as the extensive peripheral nerve impairment detected by the nerve conduction tests. Thus, TIA was excluded. Abnormally increased signal (including diffusion restriction) revealed in the cerebral MRI may be found in cases of cerebral infarction; however, the clinical course did not support this diagnosis.Lesions in cerebral white matter and recurrent episodes followed by periods of remission led to the consideration of demyelinating disease (multiple sclerosis [MS] or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis). However, in MS, the duration of each episode is more than 24 hours. Typical MRI images of MS depict round or oval lesions of different sizes in white matter. Periventricular lesions are usually elliptical or linear and perpendicular to the lateral ventricle.1 In addition, oligonucleotide bands were negative for this patient. Therefore, MS was unlikely. Furthermore, asymmetric cerebral white matter lesions are usually observed in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and the clinical course is usually monophasic. Relapse cannot occur within several days, as seen in this patient.Significant conductive abnormalities of extensive peripheral nerves in the electrophysiological examination were also observed. Cavus can usually be found in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease.2 Of particular interest were the coexistent intracranial white matter lesions, which indicated central nervous system (CNS) involvement and peripheral nerve impairment. Considering the involvement of both the CNS and peripheral nervous system, we suspected a diagnosis of X-linked CMT disease 1 (CMTX1) for the patient.Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases are a group of hereditary sensorimotor neuropathies characterized by slowly progressing distal muscle atrophy and weakness, initially affecting the lower extremities. X-linked CMT disease is the second most common type of CMT, and CMTX1 accounts for 90% of cases in patients with CMTX.3 The most notable and atypical clinical characteristics of CMTX1 are reversible cerebral white matter lesions.4 Several reports have indicated CNS involvement in patients with CMTX1.5,6 In addition to the typical CMT clinical features, patients with CMTX1 may experience recurrent dysarthria, dysphagia, limb weakness, and paralysis.4 Central nervous system manifestation may be the initial symptom for patients with CMTX1, when symptoms of peripheral nerve impairment are not obvious.7X-linked CMT disease 1 is due to mutations in GJB1, the gene responsible for encoding connexin 32, which is highly present in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes and forms gap junctions. GJB1 mutations may reduce and disrupt transmission between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in the cerebral white matter, resulting in dysfunction of the brain and transient paralysis. In this patient, analysis of the connexin 32 gene was performed and revealed a missense mutation c.311A>C. This mutation has been reported in previous cases.8 Thus, the patient was diagnosed as having CMTX1.The present case suggests that, for those with transient CNS involvement and white matter lesions, physical examination and electrophysiological examination of the peripheral neuropathy should be performed to screen for CMTX1.",Neurology,"A 21-year-old man was admitted to the hospital owing to recurrent, transient episodes of dysarthria, dysphagia, and limb weakness over the course of 3 days.

Diplopia was frequently present after repeatedly changing direction of gaze. She also noted mild right ptosis. Her visual acuity was unaffected. There was no associated headache or ocular or periorbital pain. She had not noticed any injection of the sclera. Her family and friends made no comments regarding exophthalmos. She had not noticed any deficits in axial or appendicular strength, rapid fatigability, or dysphagia. Her symptoms did not exhibit diurnal variation. Her weight was stable. She had not noted any changes in her hair, skin, or nails. She had no subjective disturbance of thermoregulation.

The second half of the Video (from 24 seconds on) demonstrates marked restriction of elevation, depression, and abduction in the right eye after eccentric gaze. Ductions in the left eye were normal. The patient’s neurological examination demonstrated a normal level of consciousness, fluent speech, normal comprehension, good attention, normal cranial nerve function aside from the aforementioned deficits, full strength, normal sensation to proprioception and temperature, symmetric reflexes, absence of ataxia, and a stable, narrow-based gait.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Ocular myasthenia,Ocular neuromyotonia of the third nerve,Giant cell arteritis,Cavernous sinus syndrome,B. Ocular neuromyotonia of the third nerve,B,Ocular neuromyotonia of the third nerve,"Examination initially revealed only a mild third nerve palsy in the right eye, which was due to radiation therapy many years prior. The subsequent development of marked restriction in elevation and depression could be consistent with myasthenia or ocular neuromyotonia, but the development of a marked abduction deficit immediately after adduction suggests ocular neuromyotonia as the correct diagnosis. Ocular neuromyotonia involves tonic overaction of the extraocular muscles innervated by any ocular motor nerve with impaired relaxation following activation.1 The increasingly severe motility deficits seen with continued testing reflect the inability of the third nerve–innervated muscles to relax after their initial activation. Thus, the inability to abduct the eye immediately after adduction provides the critical clue to the diagnosis.Ocular myasthenia also causes motor deficits that worsen with continued testing and should always be included in the differential diagnosis of intermittent diplopia. It can mimic pure oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens palsies. Myasthenia never affects the pupil. Were this myasthenia, one would expect the initial adduction impairment to worsen with continued activation.The manifestations of giant cell arteritis are protean and, like myasthenia, this should always be considered in patients older than age 50 years presenting with intermittent diplopia. Giant cell arteritis may result in transient or static dysfunction of the oculomotor, trochlear, or abducens nerves. It may also cause ischemia to any extraocular muscle. However, the history of intermittent diplopia over several years without any definitive event makes giant cell arteritis implausible, and an evolving abduction deficit with repetitive examination suggests a pathology beyond a static cranial mononeuropathy.If the abduction deficit were mistaken for a VI nerve palsy, the combination of deficits to cranial nerves III and VI might suggest a lesion in the cavernous sinus. Cavernous sinus syndrome can result in any combination of deficits referable to cranial nerves III, IV, V, and VI. Sympathetic dysfunction may also occur, resulting in a Horner syndrome. In this case, the key finding to note is that the abduction deficit developed only after adduction, which is inconsistent with a cranial nerve VI palsy.Ocular neuromyotonia may be seen as a delayed complication of radiation treatment,2 tumors,3 thyroid eye disease,4 or vascular irritation.5 The mechanism by which ocular neuromyotonia occurs is unclear but may relate to ephaptic stimulation of the affected cranial nerve, whereby axons are depolarized via nonsynaptic stimulation.6 This may explain the response seen in some patients to drugs such as carbamazepine.7 Recognition of ocular neuromyotonia is of increasing importance given the increasing age of the population and the possibility of occurrence as a very late complication of radiation treatment. What was previously thought to be a rare disease is encountered on a regular basis in academic medical settings and prompt recognition of this highly characteristic disease can avoid costly and unnecessary testing as well as iatrogenesis when the disease is mistaken for ocular myasthenia and treated incorrectly as such.",Neurology,"A 66-year-old woman with a remote history of a pituitary macroadenoma was referred to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic for intermittent diplopia of several years’ duration.

Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome,C,Fragile X–associated tremor ataxia syndrome,"This patient presented with intention tremor, balance instability, executive dysfunction, and slowed information processing. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral volume loss (Figure 2) and white matter lesions throughout the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. These features are highly suggestive of fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS),1 an X-linked neurodegenerative disorder caused by premutation expansions (55-200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene.2 The diagnosis was confirmed by genetic testing, showing an expanded FMR1 allele with 91 CGG repeats.T1-weighted images from brain magnetic resonance imaging showing bilateral volume loss in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum.Alternate diagnoses included multiple system atrophy, which would be consistent with the age at onset, cerebellar involvement, and magnetic resonance imaging signs. This diagnosis was less likely because there were no signs of autonomic dysfunction, muscle weakness, or falls. Vascular dementia was unlikely because symptoms of tremor and ataxia were more prominent than cognitive deficits, and the patient had no history of hypertension, cerebrovascular, or cardiovascular events. While essential tremor would be consistent with tremor affecting the hands, impaired tandem gait, and executive dysfunction, this diagnosis was less likely because the patient’s balance problems preceded the onset of tremor.Approximately 1 in 209 women and 1 in 430 men in the general population carry premutation expansions of the FMR1 gene.3 Up to 46% of men and 17% of women with the premutation will develop symptoms of FXTAS from 50 years of age.4 Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical and radiological features, including intention tremor, gait ataxia, parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, cortical/cerebellar atrophy, and white matter lesions in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and splenium.1 Neuropsychiatric features may include depression, anxiety, apathy, disinhibition, agitation, and irritability.5 The mechanisms by which FXTAS occurs are unclear; the most widely known pathogenic models suggest toxicity of abnormal ribonucleic acid species with expanded CGG repeats.2 Insults to the central nervous system (eg, chemotherapy, environmental toxins, and general anesthesia) may accelerate symptom progression.6Despite the community prevalence of the FMR1 premutation, FXTAS is underrecognized.7 Common misdiagnoses include idiopathic Parkinson disease, essential tremor, and multiple system atrophy. Diagnostic challenges may arise owing to lack of awareness of the disorder and the presence of clinical features similar to those seen in other age-related conditions. A family history of fragile X–associated disorders (FXTAS, fragile X-associated ovarian insufficiency, and fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited intellectual disability) may provide an indication for genetic testing. Because this patient did not have a known family history of fragile X–associated disorders, brain MRI and FMR1 genetic testing were crucial in obtaining a diagnosis of FXTAS.Genetic testing for an FMR1 mutation is recommended if a patient has (1) onset of cerebellar ataxia or action tremor of unknown cause with parkinsonism or cognitive decline from the age of 50 years; (2) a previous diagnosis of multiple system atrophy, cerebellar subtype; (3) abnormal signal intensity in the middle cerebellar peduncles and clinical signs consistent with FXTAS; and (4) a known family history of fragile X–associated disorders with plausible inheritance, based on their position in the pedigree.8",Neurology,"A 58-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of severe and progressive action tremor in his dominant hand when writing.

Spinal dysraphism,B,Spinal dysraphism,"This patient had a port wine stain/capillary malformation with a lipoma and polypoid skin tag in a single location on the lower spine, placing her in a high-risk classification for spinal dysraphism. Imaging of the spine was ordered to confirm suspicions for underlying spinal cord changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast revealed an intraspinal lipoma with extension to the lipoma present on the skin. The spinal lipoma spanned from posterior and superior to the tip of the conus, which terminated at L2, through to the spinal canal at the L4-L5 level. Per report, there was normal distribution of the cauda equina roots in the thecal sac. Based on these MRI findings, the patient was referred to neurosurgery for discussion of surgical intervention.Spinal dysraphisms encompass a variety of congenital anomalies that occur due to defects in spinal cord development. This condition is defined by failure of appropriate midline fusion of bony, neural, or mesenchymal elements of the spine.1 Although spinal dysraphism may occur at any level, it is most common in the lumbosacral spine.2 No one etiology for spinal dysraphism has been identified, but rather it is thought to occur as a result of effects from both genetic and environmental factors.2 Owing to their common ectodermal etiology and timings of embryological development, spinal dysraphisms are frequently associated with overlying cutaneous findings. The presence of these visible skin markers, especially in a midline and sacral location, is often considered an indication for further imaging to rule out the presence of underlying spinal defects. Detection of these cutaneous signs at an early stage and prompt referral in some cases can be crucial to prevent future irreversible damage.Cutaneous markers are estimated to be present in 50% to 70% of patients with spinal dysraphism.3,4 Moreover, the presence of multiple cutaneous markers has been found to incur a higher risk for an associated defect.5 Of these skin findings, the most commonly encountered associations include hemangiomas, hyperpigmented or vascular patches, hypertrichosis, lipomas, aplasia cutis congenita, and acrochordons/skin tags.2,5Related changes have been associated with varying risk potentials for underlying spinal defects.1,2,5-7 Using current data, cutaneous markings can be divided into high, intermediate, and low risk. High-risk cutaneous findings include lipoma, acrochordon, tail, aplasia cutis, dermoid cyst or dermal sinus, infantile hemangioma greater than 2.5 cm, and the presence of 2 or more cutaneous defects.1,2 Less than 3% of neonates with these high-risk cutaneous markers have no signs of underlying defects on imaging.5 Intermediate-risk skin findings include atypical dimples more than 5 mm in diameter, infantile hemangioma less than 2.5 cm, and hypertrichosis.7 Finally, low-risk markers include dyschromia, melanocytic nevi, simple dimple less than 5 mm in diameter, teratomas, capillary malformation, and telangiectasis.7 The presence of these cutaneous findings and more specifically their classification based on risk provides useful guidance for imaging of patients with suspected occult spinal dysraphism. A review article by Sewell et al2 recommended MRI as first-line evaluation in patients with high-risk cutaneous findings based on high pretest probability. Patients with intermediate-risk cutaneous findings were recommended to undergo ultrasonography if they were younger than 6 months of age and MRI if they were older than 6 months. Ultrasonography alone is recommended in patients with low-risk cutaneous findings.Spinal dysraphism can have a variety of presentations and closed or occult defects are not always clinically apparent. The presence of associated skin markers, such as those found in this patient, are often an important indication for further workup and imaging. Delayed diagnosis of spinal dysraphism may be associated with delayed development of sphincter control, delay in walking, asymmetry of the legs, and pain in the back or lower extremities.8-10 Therefore, using cutaneous markers stratified by risk category is an invaluable tool in guiding management and early detection.",Pediatrics,"An 11-day-old, full-term girl presented for evaluation of multiple skin changes that were noted at birth (Figure).

He reported numerous traumatic experiences, including frequent receipt of incoming fire, multiple ambushes, and an explosion by an improvised explosive device (IED) that injured several fellow soldiers (see Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review).1He denied any psychiatric issues prior to his military service, but reported that since returning home “there ain’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about [these experiences].” The thoughts were highly distressing and he had frequent violent nightmares. He reported intense guilt relating to the belief that he should have detected the IED and been able to protect his colleagues. He reported a number of triggers (eg, walking down a city street; driving by a shooting range) that reminded him of his experiences in Iraq and induced panic-like symptoms (eg, fear, anxiety, racing heart, and feeling shaky). He avoided things that reminded him of these events and was reluctant to discuss his history (see Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review).1He felt numb and withdrawn from others, reported difficulty sleeping, and was always “on guard.” He startled easily and had angry outbursts. The patient was hopeless at times, but denied suicidal thoughts. He reported difficulty concentrating and had significant fluctuations in his weight. He denied mania, psychosis, or medical problems. He reported drinking more than 12 beers 2 to 3 times per week. He denied any other substance abuse history.The patient was briefly in outpatient treatment while he was still in the military. He was prescribed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) but did not find it helpful and so he discontinued it. He was referred for psychotherapy but did not keep his appointments (see the last sentence of Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review).1The patient grew up in the suburb of a small city. Though the patient initially described his childhood as “great,” later data revealed a history of early traumatic experiences (see Theme 4, Epigenetic Considerations, in related Educational Review).1 What Would You Do Next?",Trauma-focused psychotherapy,Pharmacotherapy with risperidone,Pharmacotherapy with prazosin,Pharmacotherapy with propranolol,Posttraumatic stress disorder requiring therapy,A,Trauma-focused psychotherapy,"Trauma-focused therapies such as prolonged exposure therapy (PE) and cognitive processing therapy (CPT) have the best evidence to date in treating PTSD in military and veteran populations with 49% to 70% of patients attaining clinically meaningful symptom improvement.2 Focusing on trauma-related memories or beliefs, both CPT and PE are time-limited, manualized therapies typically consisting of approximately 12 sessions. CPT focuses on reframing cognitive distortions about the trauma and providing skills for emotion regulation while PE provides patients with a graded exposure to trauma reminders and triggers in an attempt to undo a conditioned fear response (see Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review)1 (Audio).The Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense (VA/DoD) clinical practice guidelines recommend trauma-focused psychotherapies, including CPT and PE, as first-line treatment options for PTSD.3 While trauma-focused therapies are almost universally recommended across treatment guidelines,3,4 recommendations regarding other types of psychotherapy have been mixed. Non–trauma-focused psychotherapies (such as supportive psychotherapy, nondirective counseling, and psychodynamic therapy) are not as effective in treating PTSD symptoms5 but may help by restoring interpersonal relationships and occupational functioning.6Direct head-to-head comparisons of CPT and PE with pharmacotherapy for treatment of PTSD are limited. Two SSRIs, sertraline and paroxetine, are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PTSD. The VA/DoD guidelines recommend SSRIs as first-line agents3 while the World Health Organization recommends SSRIs only as a second-line treatment after psychotherapy or in the case of comorbid depression. An analysis of VA prescription drug records showed that pharmacologic approaches to treating PTSD are the first-line treatment in the majority of veterans, with SSRIs being the primary agents.7 As with many anxiety-related disorders, the early adverse effects of increased anxiety can be marked with SSRIs in treating PTSD, so “starting low and going slow” with titration is important.Second-generation antipsychotics are not recommended for the treatment of PTSD except in populations with comorbid psychosis. Historically, these medications have been used as an augmentation strategy for individuals with SSRI-resistant illness. However, in a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, risperidone did not lead to improvements in PTSD, anxiety, or depression though patients treated with risperidone did show elevated rates of adverse effects.8Prazosin and propranolol have been studied as a potential treatment based on the hyperadrenergic model of PTSD (see Theme 2, Dysregulated Circuits, in related Educational Review).1 However, prazosin and propranolol have not been effective as primary treatment for PTSD. Prazosin is effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of nightmares in patients with PTSD and is recommended for this limited purpose.9 Propranolol has been explored for preventing the original consolidation of fear learning and/or its potential to block the reconsolidation of fear memories (see Theme 3, Memory Reconsolidation, in related Educational Review).1,10 While both of these ideas are active areas of investigation, neither is currently recommended.PTSD is a heterogeneous and complex disorder. Evidence supports trauma-focused therapy as first-line treatment, but a significant portion of patients do not respond adequately and nonadherence is common.2 Given these limitations, it is critical to expand our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms that contribute to the development of PTSD in order to identify and develop more effective treatments.The patient's mental health fluctuated considerably over the next several years: he engaged in medication management but consistently declined to engage in trauma-focused psychotherapy. He did well when he was able to engage in recovery-oriented work activities that distanced him from the memory of his traumatic events. However, he struggled with alcohol dependence.He eventually participated in a long-term inpatient program that focused on both alcohol dependence and offered exposure therapy for PTSD. He did well with this treatment and experienced a significant reduction in symptoms. He is currently clinically stable and sober.",Psychiatry,"A young man was referred by his Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care provider to the outpatient mental health clinic due to concerns for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. He served in the military for 4 years, including a 6-month tour in Iraq. While in Iraq he worked as an assault vehicle operator and was involved in frequent foot patrols. He reported numerous traumatic experiences, including frequent receipt of incoming fire, multiple ambushes, and an explosion by an improvised explosive device (IED) that injured several fellow soldiers (see Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review).1He denied any psychiatric issues prior to his military service, but reported that since returning home “there ain’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about [these experiences].” The thoughts were highly distressing and he had frequent violent nightmares. He reported intense guilt relating to the belief that he should have detected the IED and been able to protect his colleagues.

Examination noted normal visual acuities and swelling of both optic discs (Figure, A). Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography of the head showed no intracranial mass or venous sinus thrombosis. Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 550 mm of water and normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition. A diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension was made, and she was treated with acetazolamide. Headaches initially improved but worsened during the following weeks. Three months after initial presentation, she reported a 9.07-kg weight loss (height 1.57 m; body mass index dropped from 21.3 to 16.8 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), postural lightheadedness, worsening fatigue, muscle weakness, salt cravings, loss of axillary hair, and missed periods for 2 months. Physical examination was remarkable for ill appearance, blood pressure of 85/42 mm Hg, and hyperpigmentation of the knuckles, distal fingers, and tongue (Figure, B and C).

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Hypervitaminosis A,Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome,Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease),Anorexia nervosa,C. Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease),C,Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease),"Additional laboratory results demonstrated elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone levels (15 500 000 pg/mL; to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 0.22), undetectable morning serum cortisol levels (<0.5 µg/dL; to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 27.588); no response to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test; dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (<15 µg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.027); and elevated 21-hydroxylase antibodies (209.6 U/mL). A diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) was made. Two weeks after starting corticosteroid treatment (hydrocortisone 5 mg thrice daily and fludrocortisone 0.1 mg twice daily), her fatigue, salt cravings, hypotension, myalgia, anorexia, and tongue hyperpigmentation completely resolved. She began to regain weight. Six weeks after steroid replacement therapy, optic disc swelling had completely resolved.Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) can be acute, causing adrenal crisis, or chronic. The classic manifestation of acute adrenal crisis is shock, often accompanied by vague symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, lethargy, and weakness. Chronic adrenal insufficiency presents predominately with chronic malaise and fatigue along with additional vague and insidious symptoms such as abdominal pain and postural hypotension, generalized weakness, anorexia, weight loss, and lassitude. History and examination findings may include hypotension; hyperpigmentation and salt craving are highly specific for the disease.Intracranial hypertension (IH) is a rare manifestation of Addison disease and is especially rare as the initial presentation of this disorder.1-3 Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disorder with unknown etiology in which intracranial pressure is increased. It is most common in obese women of childbearing age. The annual incidence is 0.9 in 100 000 persons and 19 in 100 000 in young overweight women.4 Diagnosis is made with the modified Dandy criteria: (1) symptoms and signs of raised intracranial pressure (eg, papilledema, positional headache, and transient visual obscurations); (2) elevated CSF opening pressure (>250 mm of water in adults and 280 mm of water in children) and normal CSF composition; (3) brain imaging without intracranial mass or hydrocephalus; and (4) absence of other identifiable causes of increased intracranial pressure. Differential diagnoses of IH include venous obstruction (eg, thromboses, hypercoagulable states, and superior vena cava syndrome), arachnoid granulation obstruction (eg, scarring from prior inflammation), hypervitaminosis A, arteriovenous malformations, endocrine causes such as Addison disease, hypoparathyroidism, obesity, steroid withdrawal, and growth hormone use among others.5 Treatment options include weight loss pharmacotherapy, most commonly acetazolamide or topiramate, or surgery, commonly optic nerve sheath fenestration or CSF diversion procedures.Besides Addison disease, IH is also associated with other neuroendocrine derangements including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction after glucocorticoid withdrawal, relative glucocorticoid deficiency after surgery for Cushing disease, growth hormone replacement, hypoparathyroidism, and hypocalcaemia. Additionally, IH has been reliably associated with intake of tetracyclines compounds containing vitamin A.As this case shows, Addison disease can be challenging to diagnose when it initially presents as IH. Even if classic presentations of adrenocortical deficiency are absent, Addison disease and other neuroendocrine abnormalities should be strongly considered in patients with elevated intracranial pressure and otherwise unexplained fatigue, headaches, and anorexia. Evaluations for alternative causes of elevated intracranial pressure should be sought when there are atypical demographics or clinical features or papilledema does not improve with adequate medical treatment or weight loss.Although to our knowledge, the actual incidence of IH in Addison disease has never been studied, case reports abound.1-3,6,7 Traditionally, idiopathic IH has been thought to be caused by elevated CSF production and decreased absorption or increased cerebral venous pressure. Recent studies have outlined a potential neuroendocrine basis for IH, previously thought to be idiopathic, suggesting a connection between the pathogenesis of IH and Addison disease.8 Aldosterone and cortisol act on abundant mineralocorticoid receptors in the choroid plexus, regulating CSF sodium balance. Glucocorticoid deficiency has been linked to hyponatremia.9 Cerebrospinal fluid sodium concentration in turn controls water entry into CSF via choroid plexus epithelium aquaporin-1 channels, suggesting a mechanism by which these receptors may affect intracranial pressure. In addition, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases are abundant in the choroid plexus epithelium and modulate the local availability of cortisol.8,10",Pediatrics,"A white, nonobese, 15-year-old girl presented with 1 month of frontal and occipital throbbing headaches, tinnitus, and “whooshing” in the ears.

She stated that her pain worsened with walking and was minimally relieved with salicylic acid. Her parents tried to schedule an outpatient appointment for evaluation of her hip pain but had difficulty owing to a lack of a primary care physician. Review of systems was significant for heavy periods since menarche 6 months ago. It was negative for easy bruising or bleeding. The patient described normal stooling and voiding habits. The patient was described as a shy eighth grader who earns A’s and B’s in school. She was not physically active. On physical examination, the patient was noted to be short for her age (1.3 m [4.4 ft]; height in <third percentile), weight (62.5 kg; 87th percentile), and body mass index (35 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]; 99th percentile). She had a relatively short, thick neck with acanthosis nigricans, dry skin, Tanner stage II breasts, and nonpitting edema of her hands (Figure 1A). Her family history was significant for hypothyroidism and coronary artery disease in the father, type 2 diabetes mellitus in the maternal great grandmother, and hypothyroidism in the maternal grandmother. Radiography of the hips was performed (Figure 1B), showing bilateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). Prior to undertaking definitive surgical correction of the hips, it is important to consider the potential underlying condition.A, Plain film of the hips revealing bilateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis. B, Photograph of the patient’s hand, which demonstrates nonpitting edema at time of presentation. What Is Your Diagnosis?",Hyponatremia,Diabetes mellitus,Hypothyroidism,Fatty liver disease,C. Hypothyroidism,C,Hypothyroidism,"The patient’s thyrotropin level was 496 mIU/L (reference range, 0.5-4.0 mIU/L). Free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroxine (T4) levels were undetectable. Her total triiodothyronine (T3) level was low at 31 ng/dL (reference range, 68-187 ng/dL).Slipped capital femoral epiphysis is characterized by displacement of the capital femoral epiphysis from the femoral neck through the physeal plate (Figure 2). It is one of the most common causes of hip pain in adolescents and is associated with obesity. It occurs in 1 person per 1000 to 10 000 people, and typically occurs prior to menarche in young women or around the time of peak growth in young men.Patient’s plain film of the hips showing bilateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis, with dotted lines indicating normal placement of capital femoral epiphysis bilaterally.The classic presentation of SCFE is an obese adolescent with dull pain in the hip, groin, thigh, or knee or an altered gait without a history of trauma. A plain radiograph can be used to diagnose most cases of SCFE (anteroposterior and frog leg view). The treatment of SCFE is operative stabilization, with the goal to prevent further slippage and complications. The urgency of treatment depends on the stability of the slip and whether or not the patient can bear weight. Patients with bilateral SCFE require bed rest until surgery. Complications of SCFE include osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis), chondrolysis, femoroacetabular impingement, and development of premature osteoarthritis.Slipped capital femoral epiphysis can be categorized as typical or atypical. A typical patient with SCFE is obese, between 10 and 16 years of age, and presents with unilateral disease. The atypical patients with SCFE has an age outside the typical age range, is normal or underweight, and/or presents with bilateral disease. Patients with atypical presentations merit evaluation for underlying risk factors, including hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, renal failure, history of radiation therapy, and genetic disorders (Down syndrome and Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome).1-3Approximately 7% to 8% of patients with SCFE have primary hypothyroidism.1 Risk factors for hypothyroidism at presentation with SCFE include bilateral disease, height in the less than 10 percentile, and age outside the typical range.1,2 Therefore, many experts advise laboratory evaluation of thyrotropin and FT4 levels when these risk factors are present.1,2This patient had severe primary hypothyroidism, likely longstanding, based on her significantly elevated thyrotropin level, undetectable FT4 and T4 levels, and very low T3 level. She denied any obvious symptoms (fatigue, constipation, or cold intolerance) that would likely be due to the longstanding nature of her hypothyroidism. She did display typical physical examination findings of myxedema, dry skin, and short stature. She had a significantly delayed bone age of 10 years (−4.6 SD). Her vaginal bleeding was likely not true puberty but due to thyrotropin stimulation of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptors on the ovary. Owing to the urgency of the surgery to repair her SCFE, treatment was initiated with intravenous levothyroxine sodium, as well as liothyronine sodium (synthetic T3), with a slow titration to detectable levels of thyroid hormone prior to her procedure.Based on a review of the literature, the hypometabolic state associated with hypothyroidism increases the risk of decreased heart rate and contractility, hypoventilation due to weakness of respiratory muscles, decreased gut motility, reduced drug metabolism, and decreased free water clearance. Case reports describe intraoperative hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, and extreme sensitivity to opioids, sedatives, and anesthesia in undiagnosed hypothyroidism.4Owing to concerns of increased sensitivity to anesthesia of patients with severe hypothyroidism, surgery was deferred until the patient’s thyroid levels were detectable, which required approximately 10 days of therapy. At that time, the patient tolerated anesthesia and surgery well. She was discharged home and received levothyroxine daily.In summary, patients with bilateral SCFE, younger than 10 years of age or older than 16 years of age, or with a height in the less than 10 percentile should have their thyrotropin and FT4 levels tested prior to surgery because of the associated increased sensitivity to anesthesia of patients with untreated hypothyroidism.",Pediatrics,"A 13-year-old girl presented to an emergency department with bilateral hip pain for several months and acute worsening with left-sided limp following a school field trip to a large museum.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,D,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,"The clinical presentation of this patient was rapidly progressive cerebellar ataxia with problems deciphering speech, which provides diagnostic clues. Of note, the difficulty in deciphering speech might be interpreted by patients as hearing impairment. Peripheral hearing loss refers to the hearing loss caused by ear structures, and it includes conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Pure tone audiometry and brainstem auditory evoked responses could be used to differentiate the localization of the cause of hearing impairment. In the setting of subacute cerebellar ataxias combined with peripheral hearing impairment, paraneoplastic syndrome could be associated with sensorineural hearing loss when ganglia of Corti and/or the cochlear nuclei in the brainstem are involved. Adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS) syndrome caused by ATP1A3 mutation should also be considered, even though CAPOS syndrome is often characterized by childhood onset and relapsing and remitting cerebellar ataxia followed by fever.1 However, the patient did not have peripheral hearing impairment, and myoclonus and seizures are uncommon in patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia and CAPOS syndrome. In central hearing impairment with subacute ataxias, vascular events and infectious and inflammatory diseases (ie, meningitis and cerebellitis) should also be investigated.Subacute ataxia can be a manifestation of thiamine and vitamin E deficiency; vestibular dysfunction without hearing loss is a common finding in Wernicke encephalopathy. This patient had normal serum vitamin B1 and E levels. His MRI had no typical Wernicke encephalopathy findings. We empirically gave intravenous thiamine replacement to this patient, but he did not improve clinically. Steroid-responsive encephalopathy was considered, but results from an anti-thyroperoxidase antibody test were normal. Because the sensitivity and specificity of anti-thyroperoxidase is still unclear, pulse therapy with methylprednisolone was given, which was not effective.Hearing problems, such as bilateral hypoacusis2 and hyperacusis,3 usually without tinnitus and vertigo, have been reported as initial presentations of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Auditory agnosia and cortical deafness due to damage of bilateral temporal cortices were the causes of cortical hearing deficit. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually presents with rapidly progressive ataxic dementia. In this patient, the diagnosis of CJD was originally not prioritized—the dementia was initially not obvious and the hearing problem was a confounder. While results from CSF testing and EEG could be normal, normal MRI is rare. Despite the fact that laboratory and imaging tools for CJD diagnosis have moderate to high sensitivity and specificity (92% and 80% for CSF 14-3-3 protein, respectively; 67% and 86% for periodic sharp waves complexes on EEG; and 83%-92% and 87%-95% for diffusion-weighted imaging sequence of MRI),4-6 the absence of laboratory, imaging, and EEG findings can occur in patients with sporadic CJD, particularly in patients with an initial presentation of isolated cerebellar ataxia. The MRI and EEG of this patient did not show typical findings, even when the disease progressed to akinetic mutism, highlighting that CJD should still be considered even in “triple-negative” patients. The patient’s autopsy showed classic spongiform features in the thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellar dentate nucleus (Figure 2). Western blot analyses confirmed the presence of the abnormal, protease-resistant prion protein (PrP). Gene sequencing revealed no pathogenic mutation in the coding region of the PrP gene that would otherwise indicate familial prion disease. The extensive involvement of the thalamus, cerebellum, and inferior olivary nucleus in this patent could be pathologically consistent with thalamic CJD/sporadic familial insomnia, a rare form of CJD with sleep disturbance and autonomic dysfunction; however, the patient did not have these symptoms.7,8The brain autopsy showed spongiform changes with neuronal dropouts, including in the cerebellar dentate nucleus.",Neurology,"A 51-year-old man presented with progressive difficulty walking that developed over 1 month shortly after he ran a marathon.

Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS),D,Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids,"A postmortem reexamination of the patient’s mother’s brain revealed a multitude of corpora amylacea that were nonspecific and also significant vacuolated and demyelinated axonal spheroids, a pathologic hallmark of HDLS. Owing to the similar clinical course, the patient underwent genetic testing that confirmed a missense mutation c.2297T>C, p.Met766Thr in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene, confirming the diagnosis of HDLS.1,2As in our patient, MRI findings in patients with HDLS with CSF1R gene mutations typically show hyperintense T2 lesions in the periventricular deep and subcortical bifrontal or bifrontoparietal cerebral white matter, no significant gray matter pathology, and no brainstem or significant cerebellar pathology.3 Patchy MRI abnormalities in HDLS can be subtle on initial presentation and become more apparent, confluent, and widespread as the disease progresses.4Although a family history suggestive of an autosomal dominant disorder is consistent with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, other aspects of this condition were absent in our patient, including migraine with aura, transient ischemic attack, or stroke. Magnetic resonance imagine did not show characteristic extensive white matter signal changes nor any hemosiderin deposits, which are common in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.5Adrenoleukodystrophy as an X-linked disease affects men predominantly and usually manifests in early childhood. Classically, a posterior pattern is noted on MRI. The lesions typically affect the splenium of the corpus callosum and spread to the parieto-occipital white matter, in contrast to this patient’s case; the anterior white matter is usually spared. The sex, age at onset, and mode of inheritance make this diagnosis less likely in our case.6Brain atrophy and neuropsychiatric symptoms are typical of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes; however, other features of this disorder, such as seizures, lactic acidosis, or stroke-like episodes, were not part of our patient’s presentation. Progressive and exclusively white matter involvement would not be typical for mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. Also, magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients affected by mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes usually reveals high lactate peaks and involvement of the parieto-occipital areas, neither of which was found in our patient, making this diagnosis unlikely.7Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids is an adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with autosomal dominant inheritance. Loss-of-function mutation in CSF1R may cause this disease.1,2 Typically, the onset occurs around the age of 40 to 50 years, and the disease progresses rapidly. Cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms, including apathy and depression, are the most common symptoms, but parkinsonism, pyramidal signs, and seizures can also be associated with the disease.1 In addition to the white matter lesions, a thinning of the corpus callosum is a characteristic finding on MRI.2,3 Therefore, HDLS should be considered as a differential diagnosis for leukoencephalopathies in adults.Over the next few years, insidious progression of the patient’s neurologic dysfunction occurred. A neurologic examination 3 years after the initial evaluation revealed a mild decline in cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination score of 21 of 30), bradykinesia in all extremities and facial hypomimia, a right hand tremor, gait ataxia, and left-sided corticospinal tract signs. The patient never experienced seizures. Significant progression of the white matter lesions into subconfluent patches was noted on a subsequent MRI performed 5 years after initial presentation (Figure 1B). Multivoxel MR spectroscopy and positron emission tomography–computed tomography were normal (Figure 2). During the next 4 years, rapid deterioration of cognitive and motor function occurred. She became severely abulic and by the age of 30 required significant assistance in all activities of daily living and constant supervision.

She had an ovarian cyst, but her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. There was no history of recreational drug use, tobacco or alcohol consumption, or sexually transmitted diseases. Her mother had died at 32 years of age, after having a chronic neuropsychiatric illness, culminating in a rapidly progressive dementia. A postmortem brain examination reported the presence of multitudinous corpora amylacea, but no specific neuropathological diagnosis was made.Neurologic examination of the patient during the initial consultation revealed a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24 of 30 (points were missed on attention, calculation, and abstraction), and the patient was abulic, but it was otherwise unremarkable.

The dermatology department was consulted for a diffuse truncal rash concerning for a drug rash given the initiation of several antibiotics during his hospital stay. On admission, he was noted to have several scattered 2-mm pink papules on his trunk and extremities and a high density of blue-gray macules on his trunk. The duration of his skin lesions was unknown. He was up-to-date on all of his immunizations. He lived with his parents, aunt, uncle, and 3-year-old cousin. His cousin received a diagnosis of chicken pox 6 months prior, but had persistent skin lesions and pruritus. His mother had several pruritic pink papules on her bilateral forearms, which she suspected were from sand fleas.A skin examination revealed a Fitzpatrick skin phototype I and numerous ill-defined 0.5- to 1-cm nonblanching blue-gray macules on his trunk, a few of which contained a central 2-mm dome-shaped pink papule (Figure).

Pediculosis corporis,B,Pediculosis corporis,"The clinical appearance of blue-gray macules, or maculae ceruleae, is pathognomonic for lice infestation. On further questioning, the patient’s father revealed that he had recently received a diagnosis of body lice. The illness diagnosis in this patient was confirmed by his exposure history and the presence of pink papules representing lice bites in the center of the evolving maculae ceruleae.The blue-gray pigment in maculae ceruleae is associated with extravasated erythrocytes and a lymphocytic infiltrate on histology.1 The etiology of this pigment is not well studied, but some think it is because of the conversion of bilirubin to biliverdin by the insect saliva,2 while others attribute it to hemosiderin deposition deep in the dermis.1,3 Maculae ceruleae is more apparent in thin, light-colored skin, such as in this patient.4 Body lice bites typically occur along the neck, axillae, and waist, where clothing fits the tightest.5 The 15-month-old patient typically wore a fitted onesie, and his bites occurred where the onesie snugly contacted his trunk.The differential diagnosis received by the patient included drug rash, leukemia cutis, and varicella-zoster virus infection. Some medications, including amiodarone and minocycline, can cause blue-gray discoloration of the skin. However, this reaction usually occurs with long-term use involving sun-exposed or previously injured areas. Leukemia cutis may present in infants as blue macules as a manifestation of extramedullary hematopoiesis but will often have concurrent firm, raised, or ulcerated lesions. Last, despite the history of varicella-zoster virus exposure, the absence of active or resolving vesicles made varicella infection unlikely. The later development of blue-gray macules in his cousin also suggested a new etiology for her lesions and pruritus.Maculae ceruleae has most frequently been described in the literature in association with pubic lice (pediculosis pubis) but can occur because of other forms of lice. Pediculosis pubis is a sexually transmitted infection resulting in erythematous macules or papules at feeding sites that can turn into maculae ceruleae after longstanding infection.4 Pediculosis capitis results in the pruritus of the scalp, with nits clinging to the hair shaft on examination. Ragosta6 reported a case of head lice resulting in maculae ceruleae that was initially concerning for child abuse. Pediculosis corporis is caused by Pediculosis humana corporis, which lives in clothing and is rarely found on hair or skin.Pediculosis humana corporis typically occurs when clothing is not frequently changed or washed, such as among people who are homeless or people with poor personal hygiene. Management requires thorough body washing, a change of clothing, and the washing and drying of all clothing and bed linens with hot water and heat.7 Ironing clothing seams is particularly beneficial because Pediculosis humana corporis lays eggs along the seams.5 Regular bathing and the changing of clothing should treat body lice on the person, but topical permethrin, pyrethrin, or malathion application for 8 to 24 hours or oral ivermectin should be done for heavy infestation.6-8Head and pubic lice have not been shown to transmit disease. However, body lice is a known vector for bacteria that transmit trench fever (Bartonella quintana), typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii), relapsing fever (Borrelia recurrentis), and plague (Yersinia pestis). These diseases are uncommon outside of developing countries, but Bartonella quintana has been found among a large proportion of people who are homeless in developed countries, including the United States.In sum, we present a case of a toddler with maculae ceruleae resulting from body lice. Although maculae ceruleae is pathognomonic for lice infestation, few images appear in the literature.

Scurvy,C,Scurvy,"A detailed dermatologic examination revealed perifollicular petechiae with overlying hyperkeratosis and corkscrew hairs, raising concern for scurvy. This diagnosis was confirmed later in his hospital stay when his vitamin C level was reported as undetectable. On further questioning, it was noted he ate an extremely limited diet of mainly crackers and peanut butter with no fruits or vegetables, which put him at risk for vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin C.Inadequate or irregular vitamin C intake under the recommended daily allowance of 90 mg1 can lead to scurvy within 8 to 12 weeks.2 Pediatric populations at risk for scurvy in developed countries are those with neuropsychiatric conditions that lead to behaviorally restricted diets, including autism, as was demonstrated in this case.3 The restrictive diets of children with autism may be attributed to sensory hypersensitivities related to the texture of food or aversion to new experiences.4The multisystem involvement of scurvy demonstrates the multiple functions that vitamin C has in the body. These include hydroxylation of collagen, biosynthesis of carnitine and norepinephrine, the metabolism of tyrosine, and amidation of peptide hormones.5 These roles of vitamin C explain the myriad of manifestations in our patient including perifollicular hemorrhage, gingival bleeding and edema caused by diminished blood vessel integrity, corkscrew hairs due to reduced disulfide bonding, and normocytic normochromic anemia related to reduced iron absorption and bleeding.6Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography was performed in our patient because it was unclear whether his extensive lower extremity swelling could be explained solely by scurvy. His MRI showed numerous diffuse-enhancing osseous lesions and significant subcutaneous edema, which shares some similarities to previously published descriptions on MRI findings in scurvy in children.7The diagnosis of scurvy can be made clinically by observing symptomatic improvement after oral vitamin C replacement or a vitamin C plasma concentration of less than 0.2 mg/dL.8 Leukemia, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and granulomatosis with polyangitis can all present with similar symptoms to scurvy. In our patient, leukemia was unlikely with an isolated anemia and normal white blood cell count and platelet levels. Henoch-Schonlein purpura and granulomatosis with polyangitis are both types of small vessel vasculitis, and the cutaneous findings in these conditions are typically palpable purpura, while this patient had petechiae only in a perifollicular distribution with distinctive associated hyperkeratosis. Furthermore, the lack of renal involvement or other organ involvement made Henoch-Schonlein purpura and granulomatosis with polyangitis unlikely.Oral 750-mg daily vitamin C replacement was started in our patient and improved bruising, gingival bleeding, and perifollicular hemorrhage noted within 2 to 3 days. Rapid improvements with vitamin C replacement are typical in scurvy. The patient was discharged with nutritionist support and adequate vitamin supplementation. At follow-up 6 weeks later, his petechiae, ecchymoses, and arthralgias had resolved. Repeat MRI showed marked improvement in subcutaneous edema and resolving osseous lesions.This case highlights the importance of being aware of the prominent nondermatologic manifestations of vitamin C deficiency. This patient had several subspeciality consultations, numerous laboratories, and MRI/magnetic resonance angiography while awaiting the vitamin C level to return. Detection of the dermatologic clues, with recognition that there can be impressive extracutaneous manifestations, should lead to prompt treatment with rapid improvement and prevent unnecessary workup.This case demonstrates several important points. First, dietary deficiencies should be considered in children with developmental delays. Second, physical examination may reveal the classic findings of gingival bleeding, perifollicular hyperkeratosis, and corkscrew hairs, but vitamin C deficiency can also manifest with systemic features including arthralgias, anemia, and marrow lesions. Third, vitamin C deficiency improves rapidly with oral replacement therapy but holistic nutritional support is also prudent. Last, prompt recognition of the cutaneous and systemic manifestations of vitamin C deficiency can prevent a delay in diagnosis and unnecessary workup.",Pediatrics,"A 16-year-old boy with autism presented with 4 weeks of progressive bilateral lower extremity edema, ecchymosis, and arthralgias severe enough to prevent ambulation.

Multiple cavernous malformations,B,Multiple cavernous malformations,"Brain and spinal cord MRI showed multiple hemorrhages throughout the brain as hypointensities on SWI. T1 and T2 sequences showed various stages of bleeding throughout the brain (not shown) and one acute hemorrhage in the spinal cord (Figure).Because of spinal cord involvement, an amyloid angiopathy was highly unlikely. The other consideration was metastatic melanoma; however, there was no evidence of a mass effect on MRI. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy was another possibility; however, our patient had no evidence of leukoencephalopathy.The spinal T1 hyperintensity at the cervical level was consistent with acute bleeding in the right ventral portion of the spinal cord and the patient’s symptoms. There was a large syrinx cavity underneath the spinal cavernoma that was hypointense on T2 MRI and was consistent with a hematosyrinx, a rare complication of an intraspinal mass. The presentation was consistent with Brown-Sequard syndrome.Neurosurgical exploration of the patient's spinal cord lesion revealed a cavernous malformation. Apparently, the brain lesion his brother had resected was also a cavernous malformation.Developmental abnormalities of the brain and spinal vessels are found in 4% of the population and are known to cause focal neurological deficits. Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) account for 8% to 15% of these abnormalities and are characterized by closely clustered and irregularly dilated capillaries.1 Only 20% of CCMs are familial (FCCMs), which are defined as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. They are characterized by a multiplicity of lesions along the neuroaxis, with an average of 20 in each patient, but they can be innumerable. Mutations in the k-rev interaction trapped protein 1 (KRIT1), MGC4607, and programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10) genes are associated with FCCMs. These genes are encoding proteins that modulate junction formation between endothelial cells.2 Symptomatic spinal involvement occurs in 5.5% of patients with CCM.3The diagnostic method of choice is MRI SWI because it is sensitive to hemoglobin degradation products. Cerebral cavernous malformations appear at the rate of 0.2 lesions per patient-year, with older lesions changing in size.4 The bleeding risk as determined by lesion-years is 1.1% to 2.5% per year. The differential diagnoses include hemorrhagic metastatic lesions, meningiomas, low- and high-grade gliomas, cysticercosis and lipomas.3Up to 60% of all patients with FCCMs are symptomatic. The initial event is a seizure in 55% of patients, cerebral hemorrhage in 32%, and focal symptoms or headache in 13%.5 The mean age at symptom onset is 30 years, but there is no sex prevalence. Supratentorial lesions are associated with seizures and a better prognosis, whereas infratentorial lesions are associated with a worse prognosis and focal neurological deficits.6 Symptomatic lesions should be invasively treated, but the choice between neurosurgical management and stereotactic radiosurgery depends heavily on the lesion location. Nonoperatively managed spinal CCM could have a poor prognosis.7 After symptomatic hemorrhage, 40% of these patients show a full recovery, although 20%  die.8 Close clinical and neuroimaging follow-up is recommended, along with genetic counseling for family members.A positive family history indicated a genetic disorder, which was confirmed with molecular diagnostic and histological analysis of the operated tissue. The patient experienced familial cerebral cavernous malformation syndrome with a newly described mutation at c.1820dupA, p.N607Kfs*6 in exon 17 of the KRIT1 gene. The intrasyringeal hemorrhage (Gowers syndrome9) was also present.The patient’s condition deteriorated, and he underwent repeated spine MRI, which showed signs of bleeding into the syrinx on the eighth day (image not shown). He underwent neurosurgical intervention on the 11th day after symptom onset. Intraoperatively, the syrinx cavity appeared to be filled with blood. The postoperative hematosyrinx cavity shrank from 4.5 to 3.7 mm (measured on matched sagittal projections at the level of T3 to T6 on the fourth and eighth days after symptom onset and then at the 21st postoperative day).

Direct fluorescent antibody of a vesicle confirmed the presence of VZV. Because the patient’s eruption was asymptomatic and improving by the time that test results were available, treatment with acyclovir was deferred.Varicella-zoster virus reactivation resulting in herpes zoster is a well-described, but uncommon, occurrence in healthy children immunized with live attenuated varicella vaccine. Average age at onset of herpes zoster is approximately 4 years among vaccinated children.1 Herpes zoster may occur less frequently after vaccination than natural infection, possibly because the attenuated virus is less able to replicate than wild-type virus.1 Approximately 15 to 30 cases of herpes zoster occur per 100 000 vaccinated children per year, corresponding to about 700 to 900 cases per year in the United States.1,2 Risk factors for herpes zoster include receipt of any vaccination within 30 days prior to symptom onset and race reported as white or Asian (compared with black).3 Less than 5% of pediatric patients with herpes zoster have an immunodeficiency or are receiving immunosuppressive therapy.3-5 In addition, long-term follow-up of healthy children with herpes zoster has not demonstrated an increased rate of conditions associated with immune deficiency.6 Thus, evaluation for immune deficiency is not warranted in the setting of herpes zoster in an otherwise healthy child.Herpes zoster classically presents as a painful eruption with true vesicles in a single dermatome. However, atypical presentations are more common following VZV vaccination and are characterized by minimally tender eruptions that may be more papular than vesicular as compared with zoster following natural VZV infection.2 Herpes zoster lesions in vaccinated children can represent reactivation of either vaccine-type VZV or wild-type VZV, which can infect vaccinated children without producing clinical disease and remain latent in multiple sensory ganglia.7,8 Diagnosis can be confirmed by a swab specimen via direct fluorescent antibody or polymerase chain reaction, both of which have a rapid turnaround time. However, increased sensitivity has been demonstrated with polymerase chain reaction testing. Antiviral therapy is not needed in most healthy children. However, treatment may be considered in immunocompromised individuals or those with disseminated disease and would be most effective within the first 72 hours of rash onset.The differential diagnosis for a clustered, vesicular, and erythematous eruption includes lymphatic malformations, hypersensitivity reactions, and eczema herpeticum. The morphology of our patient’s eruption raised concern for a microcystic lymphatic malformation (lymphangioma circumscriptum), which is a benign congenital malformation of dilated superficial lymphatic vessels leading to monomorphic pseudovesicles (appearing to contain clear fluid) often described as “frog spawn” in appearance. While lymphatic malformations can become more prominent after trauma, such as vaccination, the acute time course of this patient’s eruption with no precursor lesion reduced the likelihood of lymphatic malformation. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions can have a wide range of clinical appearances and have been reported following vaccination. However, hypersensitivity reactions are usually generalized and pruritic. An early presentation of eczema herpeticum could appear as vesicles in areas affected by atopic dermatitis, but eczema herpeticum tends to be pruritic or painful and rapidly progresses to punched-out erosions with hemorrhagic crust.Here, we describe an atypical presentation of a common clinical entity. Early recognition of herpes zoster can facilitate timely and effective intervention. However, decreased incidence coupled with more atypical findings in vaccinated children makes this diagnosis a clinical challenge that is likely to persist in years to come.",Pediatrics,"An 18-month-old boy presented to the emergency department with a rash on the left lower extremity.

Tuberculous spondylitis,B,Tuberculous spondylitis,"After reviewing the images, the orthopedic and neurosurgical teams were concerned for spinal cord compression due to tuberculous spondylitis or malignancy. A CT-guided needle biopsy of L1 was performed, after which the patient was started on steroids for spinal cord compression. His back pain quickly improved. Preliminary results of the biopsy yielded granulomas and multinucleated giant cells. Owing to high suspicion for tuberculosis (TB), the patient was treated with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (ie, RIPE therapy). Purified protein derivative (tuberculin) was used after initiation of steroids, and he had a 0-mm induration at 48 hours; however, at 72 hours, he had an induration of more than 10 mm. The results of an interferon gamma release assay were indeterminate. Three acid-fast bacterial Gram stains of nasogastric aspirates were negative for TB; however, cultures of the same samples and a culture from the biopsy confirmed pansensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis 4 to 8 weeks later. The boy’s treatment was changed to rifampin and isoniazid for a total of 12 months of therapy.Ultimately, the patient received a diagnosis of both tuberculous spondylitis and miliary TB. A full investigation by the US Department of Health revealed that a teacher at the child’s school had received a diagnosis of the same strain of TB and is thought to have been the source of infection.Among children, back pain without a history of trauma is uncommon and always necessitates further evaluation.1 In the case of this patient, the persistent focal back pain, the failure of expected growth, and the pain waking him from sleep were all red flags. Oncologic etiologies such as Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma were considered because they can originate in the spine, although they are rare.2 Osteomyelitis and discitis are unlikely given the appearance of the bone and lung findings.Tuberculous spondylitis (Pott disease) is the most common form of skeletal tuberculosis, occurring in 1.7% of the world’s population.3 It can be a difficult diagnosis to make in children and often takes weeks or months to confirm. Diagnosis is often delayed owing to the subacute nature of symptoms, particularly in areas where TB is not endemic.4 In cases for which there is high suspicion for TB, it is important to begin therapy as soon as possible. Tuberculous spondylitis is thought to be caused by the hematogenous spread of primary TB3 but can also occur from a contiguous disease or the lymphatic spread of a nearby pleural disease. It typically presents with lower thoracic and upper lumbar back pain,3,5 which is usually present for weeks, months, or even years. Associated symptoms include muscle spasms, rigid or erect posture, weight loss, and fevers.3The gold standard of diagnosis is a culture of infected tissue, either by surgical biopsy or CT-guided needle biopsy.4,6 An interferon gamma release assay is only 84% sensitive for skeletal tuberculosis, although it is 95% specific.7 Acid-fast bacterial stains are often negative for skeletal TB,7 although cultures are positive up to 75% of the time.7 At the time of diagnosis of tuberculous spondylitis, about 50% of patients have concomitant pulmonary TB.8 Tuberculous spondylitis is treated medically with RIPE therapy,9 but surgical intervention may be warranted for patients with significant kyphosis, spinal involvement, or neurological deficits.5,10Patients with TB who are from endemic areas should be under suspicion for having tuberculous spondylitis, but this diagnosis should also be considered for children without known risk factors. For patients with tuberculous spondylitis, it is imperative to use a multidisciplinary approach (using the orthopedics, neurosurgery, and infectious disease departments and the US Department of Health).",Pediatrics,"An 11-year-old boy with a history of asthma and constipation presented with 6 weeks of intermittent, worsening lower back pain.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Reye syndrome,Urea cycle disorder,Fatty acid oxidation disorder,Organic acidemia,B. Urea cycle disorder,B,Urea cycle disorder,"In the absence of liver disease, hyperammonemia should trigger a search for nonhepatic causes (Figure 2). It can be caused by medications, surgical procedures, and infections with urease-producing bacteria. Fatty acid oxidation defects, organic acidemias, and urea cycle disorders (UCDs) cause hyperammonemia. Fatty acid oxidation defects are associated with hypoglycemia and ketosis, which were absent in our patient. The lack of significant acidosis excludes organic acidemias. These 2 disorders are rare in adulthood. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD), a UCD, was considered in our patient as it commonly presents in adulthood. Serum amino acid and urine organic acid testing showed elevated serum glutamine (21.2 mg/dL) and urine orotic acid (28 mmol/mol of creatinine) and low serum citrulline (0.05 mg/dL) and ornithine (0.34 mg/dL). This fulfills the criteria for diagnosis of OTCD.3 In patients with proven OTCD, a pathogenic mutation is detected in only 80% of patients.4 Pathogenic mutation in OTC was detected in codon 81, which had a nucleotide substitution and insertion (c.81T>CT), resulting in amino acid change p.Ser81Pro and frameshift. This is not a previously known pathogenic mutation but is deleterious; a deletion at the same codon site has been reported as pathogenic.4Approach to hyperammonemia. Information derived from studies by LaBuzetta et al1 and Wong et al.2 CPS1 indicates carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1; GI, gastrointestinal; OTC, ornithine transcarbamylase; TPN, total parenteral nutrition.Urea cycle disorders typically present in the neonatal period with vomiting and lethargy, which can rapidly progress to coma and death. They result from deficiency or absence of any of the following: carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1, ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthase, argininosuccinate lyase, or N-acetyl glutamate synthase. Partial deficiency may present in adults with acute life-threatening encephalopathy and hyperammonemic crisis leading to refractory elevation of intracranial pressure, status epilepticus, and ultimately death. Plasma amino acid and urine organic acids differentiate among the UCDs (Figure 2). The most common UCD is OTCD. It is X-linked and largely affects males, but heterozygous women may manifest symptoms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging in OTCD can show extensive cortical involvement with the insular and cingulate cortices.5",Neurology,"A man in his 30s presented with a 5-day history of vomiting, followed by lethargy and confusion.

Although the patient had a positive rapid antigen detection test for group A Streptococcus, she received adequate treatment with intramuscular penicillin and continued to have symptoms, suggesting that the positive result represented colonization, not infection. In addition, the patient completed a 10-day course of amoxicillin for otitis media 4 days prior to illness onset. A computed tomographic scan did not reveal neuroblastoma infiltration of the periorbital bones, and this diagnosis often is characterized by unilateral periorbital ecchymosis accompanied by ptosis and proptosis. Viral hepatitis in children does not present with periorbital edema and ecchymosis, and the patient’s hepatitis serological results were consistent with hepatitis B immunization.With supportive care, the patient improved with resolution of fever and periorbital ecchymoses, and minimal periorbital edema at the time of hospital discharge. In outpatient follow-up, signs and symptoms of illness had resolved, and laboratory results were normal.Epstein-Barr virus is a widely disseminated herpesvirus that is spread by intimate contact (eg, saliva or blood). Most infections are subclinical.1 Antibodies to EBV have been found in all age groups with a worldwide distribution; 90% to 95% of adults are seropositive.2For children, acute EBV infection is commonly asymptomatic; however, it can affect many organs in the body.3 For older children and adults, the most common presentation is that of infectious mononucleosis, with fever, sore throat, generalized fatigue, cervical adenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.2 For young children, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms are common.4,5 Skin manifestations such as maculopapular rash, purpura or ecchymoses from thrombocytopenia, and icterus due to hepatitis or hemolytic anemia occur infrequently.5 Periorbital edema is observed in approximately 15% of children with primary infection4 and usually manifests as transient bilateral upper-eyelid edema in the first few days of illness.6Acute EBV infection can affect almost any segment of the eye, but follicular conjunctivitis is the most common manifestation.7 Less frequently, oculoglandular syndrome, keratitis, optic neuritis, uveitis, and dacryoadenitis can occur.8 Periorbital ecchymosis and conjunctival hemorrhage associated with acute EBV infection have not previously been reported in children. It is reasonable to assume that these signs and symptoms occurred in this patient owing to mild thrombocytopenia temporally associated with vomiting.Most patients with mild illness due to EBV are unlikely to be identified because they do not seek medical attention or because EBV is not considered in the differential diagnosis. Patients with typical EBV infection can be a diagnostic challenge because signs and symptoms are not sensitive or specific.1 The differential diagnosis for primary EBV infection includes disease caused by human immunodeficiency virus, human herpesvirus 6, cytomegalovirus, and Toxoplasma gondii.2A definitive diagnosis of EBV infection can be made by testing for viral capsid antigen (VCA)–specific IgM and IgG, and anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibodies.2 Anti-VCA IgM antibodies often are detected at the time of presentation and disappear within 4 to 8 weeks. Anti-VCA IgG antibodies are detectable in high titer during early onset of infection and persist at reduced levels throughout life. Anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibodies indicate past infection and appear weeks to months after onset of illness. Polymerase chain reaction is used for the detection of EBV in tissues and fluids in immunocompromised children or those with complicated illnesses, but it is not recommended for the evaluation of immunocompetent patients.Management of EBV infection is supportive. There is insufficient evidence of a clinically relevant benefit to recommend standard corticosteroid treatment for severe pharyngitis.2 Corticosteroids may be considered for patients with upper airway obstruction, meningoencephalitis, thrombocytopenia, or hemolytic anemia.2,3 A number of antiviral drugs have in vitro activity against EBV, but none have yet shown significant clinical efficacy, and therefore they are not currently recommended for treatment.1,2",Pediatrics,"A previously healthy 7-year-old girl presented with fever, sore throat, bilateral conjunctival hemorrhage, periorbital edema, and eyelid ecchymoses (Figure).

B, Immunohistochemical stain for CD1a, magnification x40.Based on the resolution of skin lesions and absence of other organ findings, the patient was diagnosed with congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis, a form of skin-limited LCH. When a newborn presents with a diffuse rash, it is important to include LCH in the differential diagnosis. Varicella, herpes, and syphilis should also be evaluated for with empirical administration of acyclovir and antibiotics. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is most commonly confused with disseminated herpes simplex virus or varicella and should be seriously considered when the infant looks well, viral studies are negative, and skin lesions do not respond to antimicrobial therapy. Early skin biopsy can provide a clear diagnosis of LCH and prevent the infant from being subjected to unnecessary tests and treatments. Median time from symptom onset to skin biopsy is often greater than 3 months.1 Timely identification with staging allows for proper treatment of the disease with long-term monitoring.Congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis, also known as Hashimoto-Pritzker disease, is characterized by clonal proliferation of histiocytes that typically presents in newborns or children younger than 2 years. It has a diverse clinical presentation ranging from life-threatening disease with organ involvement (ie, liver, spleen, and bone marrow) to isolated cutaneous eruption.1 Congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis presents as small asymptomatic crusted reddish-brown papules, vesicles, or nodules usually at or soon after birth; it may resemble seborrheic dermatitis.2 Lesions larger than 1 cm may ulcerate, leaving atrophic scars.3 Lesions commonly regress in the first few months of life, and the prevalence may be higher than reported because lesions may resolve before skin biopsy is performed. However, spontaneous resolution of lesions does not preclude systemic involvement or future relapse.4 At the time of diagnosis, it is mandatory to evaluate for extracutaneous disease. The Histiocytosis Society guidelines recommend physical examination, complete blood cell count, liver function tests, urine osmolality, coagulation studies, chest radiograph, and skeletal survey.5Congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis is generally considered a benign disease, but it often has an unpredictable clinical course. Reliable clinical or histopathological predictors of disease progression have not been identified.6 However, progression to multisystem disease may be less likely if skin lesions are present at birth.7 Estimates of relapse range from 10% to 40% with possible new systemic involvement.1,6,8 One series reported 4 of 10 patients diagnosed with isolated skin involvement younger than 1 year later progressed to multisystem disease with mortality rates reaching 50%.6 Indeed, some authors have recommended abandonment of the “self-healing” adjective because this could be misleading because all patients with congenital LCH should have long-term follow-up for multisystem disease.4 Follow-up of patients with LCH should include assessment of height, weight, pubertal status, and neurological function as well as laboratory tests including complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver enzymes, and albumin. Additional testing depends on the history of organ involvement. Patients should be followed up for either 5 years after the end of treatment, 5 years after last disease reactivation (if not systemically treated), or until completion of growth and puberty.9",Pediatrics,"A 1-day-old male infant in the neonatal intensive care unit was evaluated for a diffuse rash present at delivery.

Nocardial brain abscess,B,Nocardial brain abscess,"At initial presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of acute infarct and was started on aspirin and clopidogrel therapy. At his second presentation to the hospital on day 16, he presumptively received a diagnosis of hemorrhagic brain infarct. This diagnosis was modified to a solitary, intra-axial, partially necrotic 2.5 × 2.1-cm metastatic tumor with vasogenic edema following magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (Figure 2). The patient was then treated with dexamethasone and prophylactic levetiracetam and underwent a right frontal craniotomy on day 21 for definitive tissue diagnosis. The neurosurgeon encountered a large amount of purulence in the capsule of the lesion and aspirated and irrigated the cyst. The patient was empirically treated with vancomycin hydrochloride, metronidazole, and ceftriaxone sodium. Gram-positive branching bacilli, Nocardia species, were cultured from the surgical specimens. The antibiotic regimen was modified to ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. With rehabilitation, the patient ultimately recovered sufficient strength and coordination to resume playing the piano at his church 3 months later.T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain on day 16 revealing a solitary, intra-axial, partially necrotic lesion with vasogenic edema primarily involving the right posterior frontal and anterior parietal lobes.Ultimately, the surgical cultures provided a definitive diagnosis of nocardial brain abscess. The patient’s extensive pulmonary disease and unremarkable laboratory results, and the worsening of his symptoms over time, suggested the possible presence of Nocardia species. Nocardial infection is often acquired through inhalation, and nocardial brain abscesses frequently begin insidiously and then worsen over time.1 Given the patient’s presentation, recent presumptive diagnosis of acute brain infarct, and new anticoagulation therapy, hemorrhagic brain infarct was a reasonable preliminary diagnosis. The neuroimaging findings mimicked those of a metastatic brain tumor: the lesion was solitary, located at the gray-white junction, and was a contrast-enhancing ring with associated vasogenic edema.2,3 While the advanced age of the patient and the neuroimaging findings necessitated consideration of a metastatic brain tumor, computed tomographic scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not reveal a primary lesion, and the patient lacked systemic signs or symptoms. In addition, laboratory results were not indicative of infection, and vegetations were absent from the echocardiogram, decreasing the likelihood of a mixed bacterial abscess as the appropriate diagnosis.Nocardia species are Gram-positive, beaded, weakly acid-fast, branching rods that are ubiquitous in the environment. Infection in humans is generally considered opportunistic, although nocardial brain abscesses are documented in immunocompetent individuals.1,3-5 Nocardial central nervous system infections often begin insidiously and lack the systemic signs and symptoms characteristic of other bacterial infections.6 Nocardial brain abscesses can be singular or multiple and are associated with mortality rates reported as high as 20% in immunocompetent patients and 55% in immunocompromised patients.6 Early diagnosis and treatment of nocardial brain abscesses enhance the likelihood of a positive outcome. Nocardial brain abscesses have a propensity to mimic other diseases, particularly with regard to malignancy. Distinguishing between nocardial brain abscesses and malignancy is critical; corticosteroid therapy helps resolve vasogenic edema associated with brain tumors4 but may contribute to the swift progression of cerebral abscesses.3 As such, an aggressive therapeutic approach is warranted to establish a definitive diagnosis.1,3,5,6 Over the past 3 decades, the number of nocardial infections has increased considerably, largely owing to the increased population of immunocompromised individuals, as well as enhanced mechanisms for Nocardia speciation.1 Consideration of nocardial infection in the differential diagnosis of brain lesions is important for both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients.",Neurology,"An 80-year-old man presented to the hospital with new-onset slurred speech and left-sided facial droop.

He was treated with 2 mg/kg per day of intravenous methylprednisolone and experienced decreased tenderness and improvement in the swelling and induration of the lesions within 48 hours. He was discharged home receiving a prednisone taper. At follow-up 2 weeks after discharge, the flesh-colored nodules had completely resolved, and the papulonecrotic lesions were greatly improved without any residual swelling or tenderness. All joint pain and swelling had resolved as well.Sweet syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, was first described by Robert Sweet in 1964, although subsequent series have shown that both pyrexia and neutrophilia are absent in 10% to 20% of cases.1 The most common associated symptoms include ocular manifestations, such as conjunctivitis or episcleritis, and musculoskeletal symptoms, such as arthritis or arthralgias.2 The characteristic skin lesion is composed of tender, painful, raised red papules or nodules with or without central clearing, most commonly occurring on the upper extremities, face, or neck. Lesions on the shins have been noted to mimic erythema nodosum, and indeed, both entities have been described as occurring simultaneously and in response to similar stimuli.3 Sweet syndrome has been associated with a wide variety of diseases in adults, including malignancy, infection, and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as medications and pregnancy.4Diagnostic criteria1 include both (1) a sudden onset of painful erythematous plaques or nodules and (2) a histology revealing dense neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence of vasculitis. In addition, 2 of the 4 minor criteria must also be met to secure the diagnosis: (1) a fever greater than 38°C; (2) association with malignancy, inflammatory disease, pregnancy, preceding upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal infection, or recent vaccination; (3) rapid response to systemic corticosteroids; or (4) 3 of 4 of the following: an erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 20 mm/h, a positive C-reactive protein test, a leukocyte count greater than 8000, or a neutrophils level greater than 70%.Although the syndrome most frequently occurs in women aged 30 to 60 years, a limited number of instances have been described in children.5 In a review of the pediatric literature conducted by Hospach et al,5 22% of reported cases in children were associated with infection, most commonly respiratory tract infections or otitis media. Associated mild anemia, as noted in this patient, has been reported to resolve with steroid treatment.6 Although streptococcal infections have been associated with Sweet syndrome, to our knowledge, this is the first case associated with a presentation of acute rheumatic fever in a child.

Psoriasis,A,Psoriasis,"Given the location and appearance of the coalescing plaques with white scale, the patient was diagnosed as having psoriasis. Because of the patient’s young age, a skin biopsy was performed; results were consistent with psoriasis. The patient was treated with triamcinolone acetonide, 0.025%, ointment twice a day on body and scalp areas and with petrolatum around the eyes. Evaluation 2 weeks after initiation of therapy revealed improved pink patches with no scale in most areas of treatment, and evaluation after 4 weeks of therapy showed near resolution with hypopigmentation (Figure 2).Infant’s abdomen after 4 weeks of topical therapy, showing resolution of the scaly patches with remaining hypopigmentation.Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the skin, nails, and joints, affecting 1% to 8.5% of white adults.1-3 Approximately one-third to one-half of patients with psoriasis are diagnosed before age 20 years, and about two-thirds have peak onset around age 20 years.1,2,4,5 There are little data on the prevalence of pediatric psoriasis, although peak age at onset is generally between 6 and 10 years and cases of infantile psoriasis are quite rare.2,5 In a review of the literature, the youngest case was at age 4 days.5 A streptococcal infection prior to presentation as well as a family history of the condition are more common in children than in adults.5,6 Family history in pediatric psoriasis cases ranges from 4.5% to 71% across several studies, likely owing to the genetic diversity of study cohorts.2,5,7The clinical features of psoriasis are sharply delineated erythematous plaques with a silvery scale. Nail pitting and scalp involvement are also seen in children and can be detrimental to quality of life.2,5 The most common sites affected in children include flexor regions owing to friction and trauma. Napkin psoriasis is a type of psoriasis seen in children who wear diapers. Its clinical features are shiny and erythematous lesions in the groin and genital skin caused by the friction of a diaper.2,8 Most cases of reported pediatric psoriasis experience some level of remission, while a small subset of cases are never lesion free.5 Psoriasis has been linked to metabolic disorders, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease. Another associated condition is psoriatic arthritis, an inflammatory arthropathy that can occur in patients with psoriasis. This condition is less likely to present in children, but it can still occur and should therefore be considered.8 An increased risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has also been shown in patients with psoriasis.9 However, studies have shown that the age at psoriasis onset is not linked to prevalence of adult comorbidities.1Treating childhood psoriasis can be quite challenging, requiring regular reassessment and individualization based on patient presentation. Most pediatric patients receive topical steroids.1,2,6 Other forms of treatment include phototherapy or biologic agents for more severe cases. Small studies and cases have shown that methotrexate and ustekinumab are effective in treating pediatric cases of psoriasis, although, to our knowledge, large studies for these treatments have not been reported.3,4,10 Furthermore, etanercept has been shown to be safe and effective in treating children and adolescents with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.7 Owing to the chronic nature of psoriasis, long-term effects of therapy should be heavily considered, particularly in younger patients.1,2,7A prompt diagnosis and customized treatment for psoriasis are critical in ensuring a higher quality of life in the pediatric population.

These symptoms fulfilled core criteria of cluster headaches, although there were an insufficient number of episodes and a prolonged episode duration.Nevertheless, after evaluating  the self-made photograph and time course of the first episode, several indications against a primary headache disorder were revealed: no abrupt start and ending of the pain episodes, a duration more than 3 hours, female sex, no nasal autonomic symptoms, and periorbital instead of eyelid swelling that persisted after the episode. Furthermore, the duration of periorbital swelling exceeded by far what is usually seen in cluster headache episodes, as well as in Tolosa-Hunt syndrome and an acute glaucoma episode.With regard to Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, at least 1 of the cranial nerves responsible for ocular movements should be paretic.1An acute episode of glaucoma could be ruled out by normal intraocular pressure and a normal ophthalmologic examination. The typical presentation is associated with conjunctival injection, yet the extent of autonomic symptoms and periorbital swelling, as well as the self-limiting character of the pain episodes and absent visual impairment, would be very unusual.2Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed a mucocele with inflammatory changes (Figure 2) and a slim gadolinium-contrasted boundary as the underlying cause.

Black-spot poison ivy dermatitis.,C,Black-spot poison ivy dermatitis,"On further history, the patient recently started to spend significant amounts of time outdoors while at daycare and in the backyard at home. Additionally, her parents recalled similar black-colored spots on her clothes and her siblings. At the onset of the eruption, the parents decreased the length of the patient’s showers and avoided washing the most involved areas for fear of exacerbation. Further inspection of the eruption revealed involvement primarily of exposed skin. The black macules were geometrically shaped and sharply defined, without a stellate or retiform morphology. The primary symptom was itch without any associated skin tenderness. Given the history and examination findings, the clinical diagnosis was black-spot dermatitis due to Toxicodendron exposure. We were able to partially remove the black streaks in clinic with alcohol swabs. Given significant involvement and discomfort, we initiated a 3-week prednisone taper. We also recommended gentle showers daily with soap and water to wash off the black macules. On telephone follow-up, we learned the patient improved significantly. The black macules were difficult to fully remove and required about 7 to 10 days of gentle rubbing in the shower. The father also discovered a significant burden of poison ivy in the backyard, which was not present in prior years.Toxicodendron allergic contact dermatitis refers to a classic dermatitis following exposure to plants of the Anacardiaceae family, most commonly poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), and poison sumac (Toxicodendron vernix).1,2 The term Rhus dermatitis was previously used until recent evidence determined Toxicodendron as the correct genus.1 The antigen found in all of these plants is urushiol, which acts as both a direct irritant and an allergen.3 Urushiol is an oily substance that can penetrate clothes, shoes, and gloves and can remain on surfaces (with antigenic potential) for long periods.2,4 About 50% to 85% of the US population is sensitized to urushiol, and skin eruptions due to an allergic contact dermatitis require prior sensitization.2,5 On reexposure, the classic cutaneous findings develop in about 24 to 48 hours and include edematous pink-red plaques, papulovesicles, or bullae. These lesions are often asymmetrically distributed, linear, and streaking and favor exposed skin that has direct allergen exposure.2 The extremities are commonly involved first, although subsequent direct spread of urushiol can lead to an eruption of the face, genitalia, and remainder of the body. The overwhelming symptom is pruritus. The black-spot variant seen here has been uncommonly described in the literature.4,6-8 The black, lacquer-like streaks are the result of urushiol exposure to air after accumulating in high concentration.2,4,6 This distinct black deposition is pathognomonic for urushiol-producing plants and can involve the skin, clothes, or any other surface.Without treatment, the typical Toxicodendron dermatitis can last anywhere from 1 to 6 weeks.2 In the setting of early plant exposure, immediatly washing with soap and a washcloth can prevent a skin eruption. Otherwise, treatment of black-spot dermatitis is the same as a regular allergic contact dermatitis: topical or systemic corticosteroids depending on the severity of involvement. If systemic corticosteroids are needed, the taper should be prolonged over about 2 to 3 weeks to avoid dermatitis flare, as seen with shorter courses of corticosteroids. The patient should also be instructed to wash daily and gently scrub the black spots with a washcloth. The black spots are difficult to remove because of the hydrophobic properties of urushiol.",Pediatrics,"A healthy girl aged 4 years presented with a 5-day history of a pruritic rash on her arms, neck, axillae, and face. The rash started as small pink bumps on her arms that spread to involve the axillae, neck, and upper chest. Four days prior to arrival, she developed significant redness and pruritus of her face. On arrival, her parents noted black streaks on her right arm, prompting an urgent emergency department evaluation. Treatment prior to presentation included diphenhydramine, cetirizine, and a 20-mg dose of prednisone without improvement. The patient was otherwise healthy with normal development and growth.

The results of an extremity examination were consistent with carpal spasm, with a fully extended first finger with hyperextended distal interphalangeal joint, thumb constantly adducted to the hand, and last 3 digits mildly flexed and adducted together. The extremity examination also revealed twitching of facial muscles in response to tapping over area of facial nerve (ie, a positive Chvestok sign1). Laboratory studies confirm hypocalcemia (with a calcium level of 5.5 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25]), and a diagnosis of tetany is made. Additional physical examination findings include wrists that are unusually wide with prominent styloid processes of the radius and ulna; radiographs were abnormal (Figure, A and B).A, The patient’s wrist is unusually wide and notable for prominent styloid processes of the radius and ulna. B, Wrist radiograph shows widening of the physes of the distal radius. There is associated transverse splaying, fraying, and cupping of the adjacent metaphyses, with loss of the zone of peripheral calcification.Further investigation revealed a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 798 pg/mL (normal range, 15-87 pg/mL [to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), a vitamin D level of 7 pg/mL (normal level, >25 pg/mL [to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 2.6]), and a normal phosphorous level of 4.5 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.323). Oral and intravenous supplementations of calcium were started, but the patient’s calcium levels remained refractory, even after correction of other electrolytes, including potassium and magnesium. He was placed on a continuous intravenous calcium infusion for 3 days with eventual normalization of his calcium level. What Is Your Diagnosis?",Hungry bone syndrome,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Chronic kidney disease,PTH resistance,A. Hungry bone syndrome,A,Hungry bone syndrome,"Our patient presented with tetany from severe hypocalcemia and had findings on his physical examination consistent with longstanding rickets. (The radiographs were notable for widening of the physes of the distal femurs, proximal tibias and distal radii, with associated transverse splaying, fraying and cupping of the adjacent metaphyses, with loss of the zone of peripheral calcification.) For a patient who is chronically deprived of enteral calcium and vitamin D, as in the case of our patient, increasing the supplementation of calcium can cause a paradoxical drop in serum calcium levels. This occurs as the bones begin to reabsorb the calcium and vitamin D that were lost from the bones in an attempt to maintain adequate serum concentrations during the period of poor enteral intake. An increase in serum calcium leads to a decrease in serum PTH, which in turn allows serum calcium to be taken up into bone. This phenomenon is known as hungry bone syndrome and is usually seen in adults following a parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism, with the surgical procedure leading to a sudden decrease in parathyroid hormone levels and an uptake of calcium.2 However, as in our patient, this disorder may be seen in children with food aversion, particularly those with autism spectrum disorder or other developmental delays. These children are at high risk for electrolyte abnormalities including those listed for our case, as well as others such as vitamin C deficiency, which may result in a presentation of scurvy.3 Strict monitoring of electrolyte levels is recommended while calcium replacement is initiated to watch for hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and/or a drop in calcium level. Specifically, ionized calcium, calcium, magnesium, and a basic metabolic panel should be tested every 6 to 12 hours until normalization of electrolyte levels for more than 24 hours. At that time, laboratory tests may be spaced out daily and eventually weekly and biweekly as the patient continues to show stabilization. In addition, close work with an endocrinologist, a speech therapist, an occupational therapist, and a dietician is recommended to help facilitate reasonable outpatient plans, ensuring that the patient maintains adequate intake of calories and nutrients.In cases of primary hyperparathyroidism, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and PTH resistance, a patient would have had a normal or low vitamin D level and an elevated PTH level like our patient, but the effect of the electrolyte disturbance or of other electrolyte abnormalities can rule out these diagnoses.4 In the case of primary hyperparathyroidism, which is very rare in the pediatric population (2-5 cases per 100 000 people), Kollars et al5 found that 89% of all patients had an elevated calcium level at presentation. Moreover, primary hyperparathyroidism in children is predominantly found in adolescent patients, and although this does not preclude our patient entirely, it makes it even less likely.In the case of CKD, a low vitamin D (specifically 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D) level would be present, but so too would hyperphosphatemia.4 This is due to a reduction in filtered phosphate by the kidney and, in turn, a reduction in excreted phosphate leading to increased serum phosphate levels. However, our patient had a normal serum phosphate level. Furthermore, CKD-induced hypocalcemia is usually only seen in stage 5 CKD or end-stage renal disease. Our patient had a normal creatinine level (0.34 mg/dL [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]) and a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (131 mL/min [normal for age, >90 mL/min]). Hypovitaminosis D and hyperphosphatemia would be seen with PTH resistance as well. This is because perceived low PTH levels cause the kidneys to fail to inhibit proximal tubule phosphate reabsorption.6 Again, our patient’s normal serum phosphate level makes PTH resistance an unlikely cause of his symptoms.Finally, it is important to recognize that our patient’s low vitamin D level was responsible for the rickets. This physical examination finding on the radiograph was caused only by poor intake of vitamin D, and not by a malabsorption syndrome or enzyme deficiency, which is rare in children outside of the breastfeeding period.5 This case serves to highlight the extreme deficiency that can be caused by food aversion related to underlying developmental delay.",Pediatrics,"A 5-year-old boy with global developmental delay presented with a 3-day history of vomiting, diarrhea, and refusing to bear weight.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,B,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"A skin punch biopsy revealed ulceration, inflammation, and necrosis, initially suggestive of pyoderma gangrenosum. However, abundant gram-negative bacilli were identified within the necrotic tissue, most notably within and around dermal vessels (Figure 2). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from skin lesion cultures consistent with the diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum. Blood culture results taken after transfer remained negative. The patient was administered 14 days of meropenem followed by oral ciprofloxacin for 7 days and was discharged after 18 days’ hospitalization. She was human immunodeficiency–antibody negative with normal lymphocyte subsets, immunoglobulins, immunoglobin-G subclasses, complement levels, and a normal oxidative burst test. Sequential full blood counts revealed a cyclic neutropenia. Genetic testing was positive for mutation of the ELANE gene, confirming the diagnosis of cyclic neutropenia.Photomicrograph of the skin biopsy showing abundant gram negative bacilli.Ecthyma gangrenosum is most often associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis but can be caused by other pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Candida.1 It is a relatively uncommon feature of Pseudomonas bacteremia, occurring in only 1.3% to 6% of cases.2 Typically found in neutropenic states, such as leukemia, it can also occur in healthy individuals.3,4Lesions appear as erythematous macules, rapidly becoming indurated papules, vesicles, or nodules and progressing to a necrotic ulcer with a black eschar and erythematous rim. They may be single or multiple and most commonly occur in the gluteal or perianal regions but can occur anywhere on the body.Herpes simplex virus skin infection typically appears as coalescing vesicular lesions with an erythematous base and can appear purple and dusky. Infection can be accompanied by fever and lymphangitis but rarely causes septic shock. Herpes simplex virus lesions crust over after approximately 10 days, followed by healing.5Streptococcus pyogenes skin infection can be complicated by necrotizing fasciitis. The skin lesions, usually exquisitely tender, are erythematous, indurated, and edematous initially and rapidly progress to blistering and necrosis.5 However, Streptococcus pyogenes is uniformly sensitive to penicillin, and the acute deterioration following initial improvement with intravenous benzylpenicillin suggested an alternative etiology. Similarly, meningococcaemia is associated with a rash, usually maculopapular or urticarial initially, and progresses over hours to petechiae followed by purpura.5 The time course here does not suggest meningococcal infection.Biopsy for histology and culture was helpful in confirming the diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum, typically showing hemorrhagic necrosis, bacilliary infiltration, and damage to the media and adventitia of the arterial blood vessels with sparing of the intima.6 The pathogenesis is thought to be because of vasculitis caused by the microorganism in the blood vessel walls, the presence of immune complexes, and/or the effect of exotoxins and endotoxins.4Early recognition and initiation of antipseudomonal antibiotic therapy is vital because the condition is potentially life threatening. Mortality rates of 38% to 96% have been reported when associated with Pseudomonas bacteremia and 15.4% in those without bacteremia.2 Ecthyma gangrenosum can be the first manifestation of primary immunodeficiency or hematologic malignancy. Thus, a thorough investigation in all suspected cases with no known predisposing condition is warranted.3,7Cyclic neutropenia is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the ELANE gene with typical neutropenic cycles every 21 days. It usually presents in the first year of life with recurring fever, pharyngitis, stomatitis, cellulitis, and other bacterial infections occurring at the neutrophil nadir. Diagnosis is difficult, requiring serial measurements of the absolute neutrophil count at least 3 times per week for 4 to 6 weeks.8 Symptoms tend to decrease in severity with age. Treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor shortens the period of neutropenia as well as the length of the cycle.8 The risk of malignant transformation is less compared with severe congenital neutropenia.9 In this case, the absence of pus in the lesions illustrated is striking, reflecting the underlying neutropenic state.",Pediatrics,"A 13-month-old girl was hospitalized with acute exudative tonsillitis.

Two biopsies were obtained and interpreted as reactive inflammation without definitive evidence of malignancy or infection.A suspected diagnosis of variant central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma was most likely given extensive workup that revealed persistent lymphocytic predominance on repeated CSF studies, despite absence of monoclonality, further supported by diffuse involvement of the leptomeninges without any evidence of infection and indolent clinical course. Alternate diagnostic considerations included neurosarcoidosis, which was determined improbable given absence of lymphadenopathy without radiologic evidence of granulomas and negative serum angiotensin-converting enzyme study results. A primary carcinoma was determined unlikely given absence on repeated CSF cytology and negative positron emission tomography of the body. Tuberculosis was also considered and presumptively treated despite repeated negative CSF acid fast bacilli staining pending an ultimately negative serum quantiferon result.The patient’s neurologic condition progressively deteriorated and he died.  Autopsy performed 3 months after presentation revealed a non-Hodgkin diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with predominant involvement of the leptomeninges.

Additional immunohistochemical staining revealed a predominance of CD20-positive cells, with a small amount of admixed CD-3 positive cells, and also detected CD 10, Bcl-6 and MUM1 a pattern consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma.In 2013, the International Primary CNS Lymphoma Collaborative Group1 identified a subset of 48 patients with sole leptomeningeal disease without parenchymal involvement.  This study, to our knowledge, is the most comprehensive regarding evaluation of epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of this rare form of CNS lymphoma specifying the subset primary leptomeningeal lymphoma variant primary CNS lymphoma. According to this study, among immunocompetent individuals, primary leptomeningeal lymphoma has a slight male predominance, with median age at onset in the early 50s. Clinical presentation reveals a predilection for cranial neuropathies and lumbar radiculopathies. Magnetic resonance imaging findings reveal leptomeningeal enhancement without obvious parenchymal involvement. Pathologic findings with cytology are diagnostic in 67% of patients, and flow cytometry and gene rearrangement studies reveal monoclonal B- or T-cell populations in 80% of cases. Cerebrospinal fluid profiles are abnormal in all patients, showing leukocytosis (median white blood cell count, 96/× 103/μL; 90% lymphocytes), hyperproteinemia (median protein level, 235 g/dL), and hypoglycorrhachia (median glucose, 47 mg/dL). The lymphoma subtype is most frequently non-Hodgkin, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.1  In one-third of cases a meningeal biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. Treatment depends on the functional status of the patient at presentation, although typically involves chemotherapy with or without whole-brain radiation therapy.1The study by Taylor et al1 did not report autopsy findings in their cohort, as their patients were identified with CSF studies and meningeal biopsies.

Ischemic stroke,C,Ischemic stroke,"Children with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are predisposed to arterial ischemic stroke, often secondary to emboli from congenital heart disease, infection (especially meningitis and bacterial endocarditis),1,2 or cerebral arteriopathy, such as moyamoya, a potent risk factor for stroke in childhood.2 In this case, the patient had also undergone surgery, perhaps with transiently decreased cerebral perfusion, and had been immobilized postoperatively.Trisomy 21 increases the risk 3-fold of moyamoya syndrome.2 Moyamoya syndrome is a progressive and chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disorder that causes stenosis of the internal carotid artery, leading to the development of arterial collaterals at the base of the brain. When these collaterals fail to compensate for bilateral stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotids at their bifurcation, as in this patient, symptoms result (Figure 2).1 It is thought to occur in about 1 in every 532 children with trisomy 21.2In children, moyamoya typically presents with transient ischemic attacks, seizures, or ischemic stroke in the form of hemiplegia and often aphasia.1,3,4 Incidence peaks at age 6 or 7 years, but has been described as perinatal stroke.5 Hemorrhagic stroke is less common in childhood; there is a second peak of moyamoya syndrome in adulthood, when hemorrhagic stroke tends to be the most common presentation.1,6 In both groups, hemiplegia is the most frequent initial symptom.1Although the pathogenesis of trisomy 21–associated moyamoya syndrome is unknown, multiple proteins associated with increased vascular disease risk are encoded on chromosome 21, including the α chain of collagen VI, superoxide dismutase I, interferon γ receptor, and cystathionine β-synthase.1 Patients with Down syndrome are known to have a predisposition for vascular disease (including abnormalities of capillary morphology, pulmonary vascular resistance, retinal vessels, and intimal fibroplasia), as well as weakened neurorecovery mechanisms, such as atrophy of cortical dendrites and reduced synaptogenesis.3,7 The diagnosis of moyamoya syndrome is usually made with magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance angiography.2Given the high morbidity from stroke in pediatric patients, neuroprotective therapy should be optimized as soon as possible. This includes maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion pressure, euthermia, euglycemia, electrolyte correction, and, rarely, treatment of elevated intracranial pressure.In the subacute phase, aspirin therapy is often recommended. Long-term treatment of moyamoya syndrome is usually neurosurgical revascularization, which has been tolerated well in children with trisomy 21 and produced good outcomes.7,8Patients with developmental delay may be at increased risk for delays in diagnosis of acute stroke with subsequent delays in treatment. Given the effectiveness of early intervention, the diagnosis should be entertained in any child with Down syndrome and possible history of stroke.7 Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography are the studies of choice.2 Moyamoya syndrome also has implications for anesthesia precautions as well as general pediatric care, such as being a contraindication to some estrogen-containing medications.7 Pediatricians who treat children with trisomy 21 should be aware of the increased stroke risk, particularly that associated with moyamoya syndrome.",Pediatrics,"Four days following resection of a scrotal lipoma, a 15-year-old boy with trisomy 21 presented to the emergency department with somnolence, pain, and paucity of speech with right hand and face weakness.The scrotal lipoma resection had been performed under general anesthesia without complications.

Cutaneous fungal infection,B,Cutaneous fungal infection,"Histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen revealed a necrotic ulcer with branching, septate hyphae within the superficial dermis without angioinvasion. Chest radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, and funduscopic examination revealed no evidence of disseminated fungal infection, and fungal blood culture results were negative for organisms. A tissue culture yielded Aspergillus fumigatus, confirming the diagnosis of primary cutaneous aspergillosis. Given the patient’s extreme prematurity and numerous comorbidities, surgical debridement was not attempted. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B alone for 21 days and eventually discharged home.Aspergillus (Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus being the most common human pathogens) is a ubiquitous environmental fungus that produces conidia in soil and vegetation. These fungal elements exhibit airborne dissemination and can contaminate ventilation systems. In fact, aspergillosis outbreaks have been reported in connection with construction near hospitals.1 Infection can occur from primary inoculation of the skin by contaminated objects, such as implanted foreign bodies, surgical instruments, or intravenous catheters, which usually produce a single lesion or a cluster of lesions. Multiple dispersed cutaneous lesions alternatively would suggest dissemination from a bloodstream infection, most often from a pulmonary source related to spore inhalation.2Cutaneous aspergillosis is most frequently diagnosed in immunocompromised individuals in the context of transplantation, human immunodeficiency virus infection, iatrogenic immunosuppression, or, as in this case, extreme prematurity. The incidence of aspergillosis has alarmingly increased at least 3-fold in the last 10 years, which is likely related to improved survival of immunocompromised patients, namely, premature neonates and those with hematologic malignant neoplasms.3 A review4 of 26 deep cutaneous fungal infections in a pediatric population revealed that Aspergillus was the most commonly isolated species in 44% of cases, followed by Candida in 33%. Specific risk factors in these cases included broad-spectrum antibiotic use (90% of cases) and neutropenia (50% of cases). Compromised skin barrier is another critical risk factor that allows entry and spread of Aspergillus within subepidermal tissues. Prior reports5-7 have accordingly linked cutaneous aspergillosis to traumatic insults, including thermal burns, lacerations, and even adhesive tape. In our case, there was no known history of trauma, but the patient was exposed to broad-spectrum antibiotics given the concern for sepsis and prednisone due to maternal lupus. Although antibiotics are thought to destroy protective flora to permit fungal growth, systemic corticosteroids impart a dual risk owing to impaired skin integrity in addition to immunosuppression.Early recognition of neonatal cutaneous fungal infections is critical to successful treatment because lethal dissemination can occur from a skin inoculation site. Cutaneous aspergillosis, like other deep fungal infections of the skin, often begins as a nonspecific erythematous papule or nodule. However, as fungi proliferate, lesions can develop a central pustule (from neutrophilic infiltration), ulceration or crusting (from epidermal necrosis), or purpura (from vascular compromise).8 These signs should prompt urgent dermatologic consultation because diagnosis of cutaneous aspergillosis is most effectively established by skin biopsy, which allows histopathologic examination and tissue culture to permit speciation and antifungal susceptibility testing.The recognized first-line treatment of aspergillosis in neonates is intravenous amphotericin B, but voriconazole has been used successfully in select instances. Isolated lesions of primary cutaneous aspergillosis are often treated with surgical resection to reduce the risk of dissemination from skin via vascular invasion; however, nonsurgical cure has been reported with amphotericin B alone9 or with voriconazole and micafungin after initial amphotericin B treatment.10 In our case, liposomal amphotericin B alone was used for 21 days, and the lesion resolved without recurrence or evidence of dissemination. Surgical debridement was deferred because of the patient’s extreme prematurity and numerous comorbidities, which made him a very high-risk surgical candidate.",Pediatrics,"A male neonate was born at 25 weeks’ gestation by cesarean delivery because of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome in his primigravid mother, who also had systemic lupus erythematosus managed with hydroxychloroquine, aspirin, and prednisone during pregnancy.

Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder,D,Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder,"The presence of subacute gait disorder, initially without other symptoms, in a patient who had received a renal transplant prompted the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy, presumably due to DM and posttransplant medications.1 However, there were no significant sensory findings on examination, episodic transient central nervous system dysfunction occurred, and brain imaging showed highly abnormal findings, clearly indicating a multifocal cerebral process despite her otherwise reasonably intact neurologic status. The imaging results, as well as her medication regimen–associated immunocompromised state, suggested the possibility of either neoplastic or infectious processes.1-5 Glioblastoma may occur at a higher incidence in patients who undergo renal transplant,1 and metastatic carcinoma is also within the differential diagnosis (especially since there was a lung nodule), but CSF pleocytosis would be atypical for either of these neoplastic processes. Infection, particularly toxoplasmosis, is a serious concern in any patient who is receiving immunosuppressive therapy, but the negative antibody titers in both serum and CSF made this less likely. The main diagnostic considerations in this patient were central nervous system lymphoma vs posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).2-5 The prominently multifocal nature of the process argues slightly more for PTLD, as does the presence of detectable EBV viral copies in the blood, but the main reason to suspect PTLD is that it would be the more common disorder in this setting of subacute brain lesions with mass effect, pleocytosis, an elevated CSF protein level, and demonstrable EBV blood viral load in a patient approximately 10 years after renal transplant who was receiving immunosuppressive medications. The diagnostic procedure was stereotactic biopsy of the right parietal lobe lesion, and examination by the pathology laboratory confirmed a dense lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltrate with perivascular prominence. The small, atypical-appearing lymphocyte population was positive for CD19 and CD20, confirming B-cell lineage, and in situ hybridization was positive for EBV, confirming a diagnosis of EBV-associated PTLD in the brain. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder occurs in approximately 2% of renal transplant recipients over 10 years, but it may occur in as many as 10% of heart, lung, or pancreas transplant recipients.3 Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder develops on a spectrum from polyclonal B-cell hyperplasia to monoclonal tumors, such as classic lymphoma.3-5 Apparently EBV, which infects most individuals early in life, reactivates in the immunosuppressed host causing B-cell proliferative expansion. Treatment of PTLD requires a delicate balance between decreased immunosuppression that might improve PTLD but compromise the transplant and adequate immunosuppression to preserve the transplant.

The clinical presentation along with the history of exposure to sheep were most suggestive of orf. Permission for a skin biopsy for histologic evaluation was declined by the patient and caregiver. A diagnosis of orf was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of a swab specimen of the lesional contents; testing was performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Orf, also known as contagious echthyma and contagious pustular dermatitis, is a zoonotic infection that principally infects sheep and goats and is caused by a double-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Parapoxvirus genus.1 It is transmitted through direct or indirect contact with infected animals, in particular through contact with saliva.2 Therefore, orf infection typically involves the hands and is most frequently seen in professionally exposed persons, such as butchers, sheep shearers, and veterinary surgeons. Exposure may also occur through contact with infected animals in petting zoos, livestock fairs, and holiday manger scenes.2,3 Nontraditional means by which orf has been transmitted to humans include household meat processing, animal slaughter, and contact with infected fomites.3 The manner in which children may interact with infected animals can lead to the presence of lesions on atypical sites, such as facial lesions.3 Human transmission of orf does not occur.Infected animals typically manifest sore mouth, which is characterized by painful oral blisters and crusts that interfere with eating. There are 2 commercially available veterinary vaccines, but some sheep farm operators produce their own vaccine from the scabs of previously infected animals. Vaccines are fully virulent and infectious to humans who have contact with the vaccine itself or with vaccinated animals. Immunity conferred by vaccines or natural infection is not complete or lifelong, and vaccine failures have been reported.1,3The incubation period varies from 4 days to 2 weeks, and skin lesions generally appear on the fingers, hands, or forearms after a 3- to 7-day incubation period. Clinical presentation is that of a lesion that progresses through the following 6 stages in 4 to 8 weeks: (1) in the maculopapular stage, an erythematous, often tender macule or papule is noted at the exposure site; (2) in the target stage, the lesion acquires an erythematous center, which may be composed of a shallow ulcer with an outer white halo and peripheral erythema; (3) in the acute stage, a weeping nodule is noted; (4) in the regenerative phase, the exudate begins to dry (5); in the papillomatous stage, a papilloma-like lesion with a dry crust forms; and (6) in the last stage, the lesion resolves with minimal scarring.2 Significant lymphadenopathy is uncommon in orf infection. Associated signs and symptoms in immunocompetent hosts are rare but include fever, malaise, lymphadenitis, lymphangitis, and secondary bacterial infection.2Orf is mainly a clinical diagnosis supported by a history of contact with infected animals. Diagnostic assays are available to facilitate the differentiation of orf virus infection from other parapoxvirus infections, such as pseudocowpox, because the clinical presentation is indistinguishable. The differential diagnosis also includes atypical mycobacterial infection, tularemia, cutaneous anthrax, herpetic whitlow, and ecthyma. Standard and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays can confirm the diagnosis. Testing is available at the Poxvirus Laboratory of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.4Treatment generally consists of local wound care because spontaneous resolution is the rule in immunocompetent persons, although secondary bacterial infection may occur. Several case reports and a case series suggest that use of topical imiquimod may facilitate healing, in particular in immunocompromised persons.5 Misdiagnosis may result in inappropriate therapeutic interventions.

Follow-up convalescent titers (24 days after discharge) revealed that the IgM antibody titer to E chaffeensis was less than 1:20 and the IgG titer was still 1:1024. His transaminase levels had normalized at 27 U/L of aspartate transaminase and 12 U/L of alanine transaminase. He had no other clinically apparent sequelae from the illness.Human monocytic ehrlichiosis refers to illness caused by one of the various tick-borne rickettsial proteobacteria of the Ehrlichia species (most commonly E chaffeensis or Ehrlichia ewingii).1 However, HME is now classified as a separate entity from human granulocytic anaplasmosis, previously known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum, although the 2 may have similar clinical presentations.1 Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is most common in the southeastern and southcentral United States because this is where the vector Amblyomma americanum (lone star tick) resides.2 In addition, HME is more commonly reported in the summer months and in males (60%).3Clinical signs and symptoms of HME generally present 1 to 2 weeks after initial exposure, and the disease can be fatal (1%-3% case fatality rate) if not recognized and treated promptly.1 The most common presentations include fever (50%-95%), rash (60%), and various systemic symptoms (20%-50%), such as headaches, chills, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, myalgias, malaise, or altered mental status.1,4 The most common laboratory findings are elevated transaminase levels (>80%), leukopenia (60%-70%), and hyponatremia (up to 70%).1,4 Although up to 50% of ehrlichiosis cases may present with gastrointestinal symptoms, it is exceedingly rare to present with an acute abdomen. Only 3 other cases of patients presenting with an acute abdomen could be found in the literature: 1 pediatric case with human granulocytic anaplasmosis and 2 adult cases (1 HME and 1 human granulocytic anaplasmosis case).5-7 Diagnosis of HME is made based on serologic testing; however, if there is clinical suspicion of HME, treatment should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation.3 Doxycycline is the first-line treatment for HME in both children and adults and is more likely to be effective if started immediately.3The differential diagnosis is broad for a child presenting with fever, emesis, rash, and abdominal pain. Adenovirus, parvovirus B19, and Epstein-Barr virus were considered and can present similarly to HME but were ruled out based on history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis can be difficult to diagnose due to its nonspecific initial symptoms, and patients may not report a history of a tick bite or exposure, but it should always be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with any combination of an acute abdomen, prolonged fever, nausea, emesis, conjunctivitis, and rash, accompanied by characteristic laboratory findings, such as pancytopenia, hyponatremia, or transaminitis, in the appropriate epidemiologic setting.",Pediatrics,"A previously healthy 6-year-old boy presented with 6 days of fever (maximum temperature of 40°C), intermittent nonbilious emesis, and 4 days of crampy, diffuse abdominal pain. Physical examination findings were significant for ill appearance, bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, shotty bilateral anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, diffuse abdominal tenderness (greatest in the right upper quadrant), and associated rebound and guarding. There was also a blanching, erythematous, macular rash on his cheeks (Figure, A) and an intermittent, erythematous, reticular rash on his chest, abdomen, arms, and legs (Figure, B) that spared his palms and soles and flared with fever. The remainder of his examination findings were unremarkable. Laboratory studies were significant for an elevated aspartate transaminase level of 264 U/L (reference range, 12-47 U/L; to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167) and an alanine transaminase level of 251 U/L (reference range, 17-63 U/L; to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167).

Results of staining of the endothelial cells of the vessels were diffusely and strongly positive for GLUT1.Ultrasonography of the spinal cord was performed given the concern for other congenital anomalies and demonstrated inferior displacement of the conus medullaris at L3-L4, suggesting a tethered spinal cord. Results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, abdomen, and pelvis confirmed a tethered spinal cord, inserting into an intrathecal lipoma that extended from L4 to the inferior aspect of the thecal sac. Ultrasonography of the urinary system demonstrated no abnormalities. The patient was evaluated at a multidisciplinary vascular anomalies clinic and was given oral propranolol hydrochloride for the ulcerated IH.Segmental hemangiomas develop on specific anatomical boundaries and often have geographic, sharply defined borders. This appearance is in contrast with that of typical IHs, which usually arise from single macules that evolve into papules, nodules, or tumors.1 Segmental IHs of the lower extremity, lumbosacral area, or perineum are frequently associated with several internal anomalies, which were previously described as PELVIS (perineal hemangioma, external genitalia malformations, lipomyelomeningocele, vesicorenal abnormalities, imperforate anus, skin tag) or SACRAL (spinal dysraphism; anogenital, cutaneous, renal, and urologic anomalies; associated with an angioma of lumbosacral localization) syndrome. Iacobas et al1 coined the acronym LUMBAR (lower-body infantile hemangioma and other skin defects, urogenital anomalies, ulceration, myelopathy, bony deformities, anorectal malformations, arterial anomalies, and renal anomalies) to convey the currently known associated anomalies.One-third of all ulcerated hemangiomas are found in the perineum.2 Ulceration is more common in children with LUMBAR syndrome, found in 70% of reported cases. When present, ulceration occurs most commonly in the sacral region, followed by the lumbar and perineum or genital areas. Eighty-three percent of patients had evidence of myelopathy on MRI.1 The most frequently reported anomaly in LUMBAR syndrome is tethered spinal cord, seen in 75% of patients, including our patient.1Our patient’s lesion began as a large telangiectatic patch without the typical proliferative growth characteristic of IH; thus, it is better classified as IH with minimal or arrested growth (IH-MAG). In a retrospective case series by Suh and Frieden,3 the lower body was found to be the most common location for IH-MAG, occurring in 32 of 47 lesions (68%). Only 14 of these 47 lesions (30%) were in a segmental distribution. Infantile hemangioma with minimal or arrested growth was more frequent in girls and showed an increased association with extracutaneous anomalies.3 As in IH, results of staining of blood vessels in IH-MAG are positive for GLUT1, in contrast to vascular malformations, noninvoluting congenital hemangiomas, and rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas.4The pathogenesis of LUMBAR syndrome is unknown. When a segmental hemangioma is located on the lower half of the body, a thorough physical examination of the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities is necessary. Iacobas et al1 recommend imaging of the spine, abdomen, and pelvis. While MRI is a more sensitive imaging modality to identify associated anomalies, ultrasonography is recommended in infants younger than 3 months to avoid risks associated with sedation. Ossification of the posterior spinal elements occurs at approximately 3 to 4 months of age, limiting use of ultrasonography beyond this age.5 The presence of high-risk features for spinal dysraphism, such as midline segmental hemangiomas, lipomas, and hypertrichosis, should prompt the physician to perform an MRI after 3 months of life even if the ultrasonogram showed no abnormalities.In addition, arterial anomalies may underlie a segmental IH of the lower limb or at sites distant from the primary segmental IH.1 There is limited use of MRI or magnetic resonance angiography in infants because of risks associated with anesthesia; therefore, arterial anomalies may be underreported in the literature. Segmental IH of the lower extremity should prompt physicians to screen for associated internal anomalies of LUMBAR syndrome.",Pediatrics,"A 7-week-old full-term girl was referred to our clinic for persistent and expanding diaper dermatitis present since 1 week of age.

His perinatal history was notable for macrosomia, macrocephaly, left-sided failure on newborn hearing screen, and a congenital hypertrichotic patch of the left scalp. During the first few months, he was observed to frequently tug at his left ear while displaying apparent discomfort and sleeping difficulties. He was treated empirically with multiple antibiotics for presumed otitis media and subsequently had bilateral myringotomy tubes placed. When the left side of his face became more swollen, magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 8 months of age and revealed a left-sided parotid mass. He was referred to our institution for further evaluation.Additional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and neck revealed an infiltrative vascular mass of the left parotid, skull base, and deeper facial structures with occlusion of the left internal jugular vein and extension into the external auditory canal.

Hypertrichosis of the scalp lesion is consistent with an underlying plexiform neurofibroma (PNF). The patient’s tan patches were café au lait macules and totaled approximately 15, of which 8 measured greater than 5 mm. Although multiple café au lait macules can be a benign, isolated finding within families, combined with the patient’s macrocephaly, these findings were suggestive of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; Von Recklinghausen disease).2 Biopsy of the mass revealed a PNF (Figure 2), and genetic testing revealed a heterozygous truncating mutation in exon 51 of the NF1 gene, diagnostic of NF1.Plexiform neurofibroma. Large fascicles of spindle cells are embedded in a myxoid stroma. Salivary glands are present at the periphery (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×100).Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in the neurofibromin gene, whose product negatively regulates intracellular signaling through the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway, which modulates cell growth and differentiation.2 Two of 7 clinical criteria are required to diagnose NF1: (1) 6 or more café au lait macules (>5 mm in size if prepubertal and >15 mm if postpubertal), (2) 2 or more neurofibromas or at least 1 PNF, (3) axillary or inguinal freckling, (4) optic glioma, (5) 2 or more Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas), (6) sphenoid wing dysplasia or cortical bone thinning of long bones, and (7) a first-degree relative diagnosed as having NF1.2 Other findings that may raise suspicion for neurofibromatosis in the proper context include macrocephaly, nevi anemicus, juvenile xanthogranulomas, and multiple glomus tumors.2,3Plexiform neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumors that are typically congenital but may go unnoticed until childhood, when they have their most substantial growth.4 Nevertheless, they can be disfiguring or cause functional compromise and may eventuate in malignant degeneration in the form of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.2,5 On palpation, PNFs are firm but relatively pliable, often described as a bag of worms. Overlying hyperpigmented, thickened skin and hypertrichosis are associated with PNFs but may result in their misclassification as congenital melanocytic nevi.2 We speculate that the blue hue associated with our patient’s PNF was secondary to its vascularity and superficial positioning. Parotid-auricular-occipital PNFs are not common but are notable for their significant associated morbidity, including disfigurement and deafness.6 Treatment consists of observation or surgical debulking, with associated risks of facial nerve paralysis and significant blood loss.6 Studies evaluating targeted molecular therapies to decrease the disease burden of PNFs are ongoing, with selumetinib (a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor) and sirolimus (a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor) showing promise.7The differential diagnosis for infantile preauricular masses includes IHs. Parotid IHs present as rapidly growing tumors that are either solitary or part of a larger segmental hemangioma.1 Notably, hypertrichosis is not an associated feature of these growths. Suppurative parotitis and parotid abscesses, in contrast, often present acutely as painful unilateral preauricular swelling accompanied by low-grade fever and at times cellulitis.8 Venous malformations, although congenital and often blue, can be distinguished by a more nodular appearance and enlargement of surrounding veins.9Our patient had revision of his left myringotomy tube with copious serous discharge from the affected ear canal and postoperative improvement in pain and facial swelling. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed no visual disturbances, optic disc swelling, or Lisch nodules. He continues to develop normally. Close follow-up with a dedicated neurofibroma specialist was recommended to permit vigilant monitoring of the potential malignant tumors (including low-grade gliomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia); renovascular, cerebrovascular, and cardiovascular complications, including hypertension; and cognitive-behavioral challenges associated with NF1.2,10",Pediatrics,"A 9-month-old boy presented with a left-sided facial mass.

He experienced headache followed by development of ptosis and diplopia in the last 2 episodes. The history is suggestive of recurrent right third cranial nerve palsy; associated fourth and sixth cranial nerve palsies cannot be completely excluded. The differential diagnosis of recurrent third nerve palsy is broad and includes cavernous sinus pathologic conditions (eg, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, tumors), oculomotor nerve tumors, intracranial aneurysms, intracranial infections, diabetic ophthalmoparesis, myasthenia, and recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy.1,2 Results of neuroimaging ruled out structural lesions such as tumors and aneurysms as well as cavernous sinus pathologic conditions. The presence of only intermittent right-sided symptoms during a 3-year period with no other ocular, bulbar, or limb weakness makes myasthenia unlikely. Complete ptosis with diplopia is not consistent with Horner syndrome. Results of tests on cerebrospinal fluid collected via lumbar puncture did not suggest intracranial infection.There is a considerable debate regarding the nomenclature of this entity. The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta version),3 defines this entity as recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy. It was referred to in the past as ophthalmoplegic migraine.3 Ophthalmoplegic migraine is a poorly understood neurologic syndrome characterized by recurrent bouts of head pain and ophthalmoplegia.4,5Ophthalmoplegic migraine is characterized by repeated attacks of paresis of 1 or more ocular cranial nerves (commonly the third), at least 2 attacks presenting with unilateral headache, and ipsilateral paresis of 1 or more ocular motor nerves.3 Orbital, parasellar, or posterior fossa lesion should be excluded by appropriate investigations.The onset of this entity is almost always during childhood, but there is growing evidence that it also occurs in adults.6 Although it is thought to be common in males, it can affect both sexes.7,8 The term ophthalmoplegic migraine is rejected in the recent classification because it is thought that this syndrome is not migrainous but rather a recurrent painful neuropathy.3 Another striking feature is that the headache can precede ophthalmoparesis by about 14 days. The ophthalmoparesis usually improves after most attacks but can persist longer after subsequent attacks.9 The patient in our case experienced unilateral headache with ipsilateral ptosis and diplopia in 2 of the 3 episodes; headache preceded ophthalmoparesis by 6 to 7 days followed by complete recovery.The pathophysiologic cause of this entity is unclear without a definite vascular, infective, or systemic inflammatory process accountable for these symptoms.5 A recurrent demyelinating cranial neuropathy has been proposed as a possible hypothesis for this condition,10 but it is unknown what triggers the demyelinating event. There is no evidence to suggest a systemic inflammatory process associated with this entity.5 A family history of migraine or other types of headache is not always present4; however, our patient had a family history of migraine.Neuroimaging should be performed to diagnose or exclude other structural causes of ophthalmoplegia.4 Results of contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging often reveal focal third-nerve enhancement.3-5 There are no published treatment trials for this entity. Treatment is based on anecdotal reports, with corticosteroid administration correlating with clinical response in some patients.3,5",Pediatrics,"A young boy presented for evaluation of “droopiness” of the eyelid.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Retroperitoneal abscess,Lymphatic malformation,Urinoma,Pancreatic pseudocyst,B. Lymphatic malformation,B,Lymphatic malformation,"The patient had a lymphatic malformation (LM). Most LMs are congenital, but there have been a few reports1 of development after trauma or infection. There are no known risk factors. Lymphatic malformations  are a type of congenital vascular malformation caused by a development abnormality resulting in formation of vascular channels without cellular proliferation.2 Vascular malformations are subtyped as high-flow (arterial) vs low-flow (venous or lymphatic) lesions, with low-flow lesions being the most common.2 Approximately 25% of these low-flow lesions are completely or partially lymphatic in origin. Only 1% of LMs occur in the retroperitoneum; they most frequently develop in the neck and axilla.3 Lymphatic malformations of the retroperitoneum may be asymptomatic and thus undiagnosed until adolescence or early adulthood. Lymphatic malformations of the head or neck are quickly identified by the caregiver or physician owing to their external location; however, a retroperitoneal mass must grow to a substantial size before exhibiting any symptoms or physical findings. In some situations, a retroperitoneal LM is discovered as an incidental finding on radiographic imaging obtained for another reason, such as trauma. In addition, there have been reports4 of trauma causing hemorrhage in a previously undiagnosed LM.Radiographic imaging, such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomographic scanning, is necessary to diagnose a retroperitoneal mass and is useful in evaluation of vascular malformations. Intravenous contrast may distinguish low-flow lesions from hemangioma or high-flow lesions. The differential diagnosis for a large, multilobulated, cystic retroperitoneal mass in a child includes LM, pancreatic pseudocyst, choledochal cyst, urinoma, and teratoma.2-4 There are no clinical features that can conclusively differentiate a retroperitoneal LM from other retroperitoneal masses; thus, surgery is required to make a definitive diagnosis. However, the other possibilities have components of the patient’s history, physical examination, laboratory work, or imaging that may be more suggestive of other causes including pancreatic pseudocyst (usually follows an episode of pancreatitis or blunt trauma), choledochal cyst (frequently presents with cholestasis), urinoma (often related to a blunt traumatic injury), and teratoma (frequently appears heterogeneous with calcifications, although a large cystic component may mimic an LM).The mainstay of therapy for an LM is surgical resection, although sclerotherapy with OK-432 or ethanol has been done with success.2,3 Sclerotherapy is considered for diffuse or large LMs in which a complete surgical resection cannot be performed owing to involvement of vital structures. In such a case, a combined approach of partial resection for volume reduction followed by sclerotherapy to completely fibrose the remaining lymphovenous tissue could be used. Surgical excision may have a 10% recurrence rate in head and neck LMs; there are limited data regarding the rate in retroperitoneal LMs.5 For this reason, long-term surveillance with ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed to monitor for recurrence.This patient underwent successful resection after placement of bilateral ureteral stents. The retroperitoneal location was confirmed when the right ureter was identified intraoperatively on the anterior aspect of the mass (Figure 2). She made an uneventful postoperative recovery. Magnetic resonance imaging obtained 5 months postoperatively showed no evidence of recurrence.Intraoperative image of a massive retroperitoneal mass with displacement of the ureter.",Pediatrics,"An adolescent girl presented to her pediatrician reporting abdominal distention.

However, progressive supranuclear palsy was the most likely diagnosis because of the early features of imbalance and falls, parkinsonism without tremor, and marked midbrain atrophy visible on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (hummingbird sign is seen in the sagittal midline slice [top right of Figure 2]).1-5 Alzheimer disease was unlikely because of the lack of early memory change, the MR imaging and PET results, and the normal tau and phosphotau levels in cerebrospinal fluid. While there was considerable imbalance and cerebellar atrophy, the asymmetric examination findings, prominent brainstem atrophy, cognitive changes,3 and lack of dysmetria, nystagmus, or other classic cerebellar signs all militated against spinocerebellar degeneration. Although the asymmetric motor examination results could be indicative of corticobasal ganglionic degeneration (corticobasal degeneration), these findings can also be seen in progressive supranuclear palsy. The lack of a classic pattern of bicentral hypometabolism on PET, the presence of marked midbrain tectal atrophy2 and dysphagia, and the absence of alien limb or dysgraphesthesia all make corticobasal syndrome less likely. Finally, while several features were suggestive of behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration, the presence of such prominent motor signs and symptoms early in the disease course, as well as the MR imaging and PET results, makes such a diagnosis less likely. The diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome) was confirmed at autopsy.1,5 Throughout the cortex and subcortical gray nuclei, a diffuse and severe burden of glial phosphorylated tau pathology was observed, evidenced through immunohistochemical staining with antibody AT8. There were frequent tufted astrocytes, scattered neuronal and glial tangles, marked gliosis, and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the white matter. Neuronal losses in the substantia nigra, pars compacta, and pars reticulata were severe. There were few neuronal tangles and no evident plaques using immunohistochemical stains for β-amyloid. Finally, there was no evidence of α-synuclein aggregates (as seen in Lewy body disease) or transactive response DNA-binding protein 32 (TDP-43) abnormalities (as seen in some frontotemporal dementia disorders).Brain magnetic resonance imaging (same as Figure 1B) was interpreted as “normal” but in fact shows marked midbrain atrophy, most prominent in the tectum (yellow arrowhead), and also evident in the “hummingbird” sign seen on sagittal image (white arrowhead).",Neurology,"A woman in her 50s was referred to a neurologist for a history of gait, balance, personality, and judgment changes over 4 years.

Circumscribed juvenile pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP),C,Circumscribed juvenile pityriasis rubra pilaris,"A biopsy was performed to support our clinical suspicion. Results of histologic examination of the rash demonstrated alternating vertical and horizontal orthokeratosis and parakeratosis in a checkerboard pattern (Figure 2). Sparse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate was seen in the papillary dermis. While not pathognomonic, these characteristic histologic findings, correlated with the clinical presentation, are most consistent with a diagnosis of PRP.1,2 The patient applied triamcinolone acetonide cream, 0.1%, daily to the thick areas, with moderate improvement. Hydrocortisone valerate cream, 0.2%, which the patient had previously used, was not strong enough for these thick lesions.Results of histologic examination revealed alternating vertical and horizontal orthokeratosis (white arrowheads) and parakeratosis (blue arrowheads) in a checkerboard pattern (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification x40).Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a chronic disorder of cornification with onset in early childhood. No clear etiology has been established, although there has been suggestion of vitamin A deficiency and viral infections playing a role in the pathogenesis of PRP.3 Case reports have implicated varicella-zoster virus, β-hemolytic streptococcal infection, and even Kawasaki disease, suggesting that PRP may be a reactive exanthema related to a superantigen.4 Human immunodeficiency virus–related PRP cases have been reported, suggesting an abnormal immunologic response to particular antigens.5Pityriasis rubra pilaris has been divided into 5 subtypes, although types III and IV are the forms most commonly seen in children.3,6 The classic adult subtype, type I, accounts for half of the cases of PRP and is typically seen in adults in the sixth decade of life. This form of PRP usually begins in the head and neck region and progressively advances caudally. Type II, the atypical adult form seen in 5% of patients, differs from type I in that it includes a palmoplantar keratoderma with a coarse lamellated scale and occasional alopecia. Types III to V are seen in children and young adults. Type III is the classic juvenile form, seen in 10% of cases. Patients with this form of PRP present similarly to patients with type I; however, they are younger at disease onset. Type IV, circumscribed juvenile PRP, is the most common juvenile form seen in 25% of cases and is characterized by hyperkeratotic plaques on the knees and elbows. Type V, the atypical juvenile form, presents most commonly in early childhood, with thickening of the palms and soles.The differential diagnosis for our patient with type IV (circumscribed juvenile) PRP includes psoriasis, keratosis pilaris, erythrokeratodermia variabilis, drug eruption, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and Sézary syndrome. Psoriasis has a similar distribution and similar spectrum of severity, including erythroderma; therefore, it is the most likely clinical differential diagnosis. Psoriasis tends to have more adherent scale without the areas of sparing seen in patients with erythroderma. A lack of family history of psoriasis and the presence of follicular papules that have a nutmeg grater texture also help distinguish PRP from psoriasis.Treatment for PRP varies based on the clinical scenario. Standard initial therapy for patients with limited disease is a class 1 or 2 topical corticosteroid ointment or oil with or without keratolytics. Our patient gained relief and improvement with the application of a potent topical corticosteroid alternating with a solution of lactic acid, 12%, under occlusion. Patients with more severe manifestations of disease may require systemic corticosteroids necessitating tapering, systemic retinoids, methotrexate, azathioprine, or cyclosporine.3 Phototherapy can exacerbate PRP or induce remission7; success has been reported with narrow-band UV-B in combination with acitretin for more widespread disease.8 Although the prognosis is variable, with some patients’ symptoms resolving within 6 months and others’ symptoms persisting for many years, type IV PRP typically persists for 1 to 2 years and fades with no scarring, as was the case in our patient.3,6",Pediatrics,"A healthy 7-year-old girl presented with a 2-month history of an itchy rash on her elbows, knees, hands, and feet.

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD),D,Hand-foot-and-mouth disease,"Onychomadesis describes the complete shedding of the nail plate from the nail bed, occurring after a sudden growth arrest of the nail matrix (Figure, B). As a milder variant, Beau lines may be seen presenting as semilunar transverse grooves of the nail plate (Figure, A). While nail changes can be an important marker of genetic conditions or internal disease in pediatric patients, they are usually associated with additional changes of the skin, mucous membranes, or hair. Although often suspected by parents, onychomycosis is rare overall in young children.1 Nail dystrophy in childhood is often due to eczema or paronychia affecting the nail matrix. Onycholysis and hyperkeratosis of the nail may be the result of subungual warts.2 Acute onychomadesis is often considered to be idiopathic, but various infectious triggers have been described.The history of our patient revealed HFMD 7 weeks before the onset of the nail changes. It is a rather common infection in children caused by coxsackievirus, a member of the family of enteroviruses. Small epidemic outbreaks are usually reported in autumn or spring. The condition is characterized by low-grade fever and an acute vesicular eruption of the hands, feet, buttocks, oral cavity, lips, and perioral area. The blisters are usually small, oval shaped, and grayish with an erythematous border in combination with a vesicular and erosive stomatitis. However, the clinical presentation is very variable, with some children presenting with only a few blisters and others with generalized exanthema (eczema coxsackium).3Since the first 5 cases reported in 2000,4 HFMD has come to be associated with nail matrix arrest and onychomadesis. Several local epidemics of HFMD with up to 220 patients affected by onychomadesis have been reported.5 Several strains were identified, most commonly coxsackievirus B1 as in Spain6 and coxsackievirus A6 as in Japan.7 The mechanism for post-HFMD nail matrix arrest remains unclear. No relationship seems to exist between the severity of HFMD, location of blisters, and fever. One group was able to detect coxsackievirus A6 DNA extracted from nail fragments in children with onychomadesis, supporting the idea of direct nail matrix damage due to virus replication.8 Others have discussed secondary appearance due to inflammation of the nail matrix.9 Nail changes typically appear 3 to 10 weeks after the onset of infection. During the North American HFMD epidemic in 2011-2012, secondary nail changes were noted in approximately one-quarter of cases.3 Others report higher incidences of up to 70% when coxsackievirus is involved.6 To our knowledge, no reports of onychomadesis have been reported when other enteroviruses such as enterovirus 71 were the cause of HFMD. Other causes for acute onychomadesis include infections involving high fever (norovirus infection, swine flu, scarlet fever), Kawasaki syndrome, drug intake (anticonvulsants, antibiotics, chemotherapy agents, and retinoids), acute paronychia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, pemphigus vulgaris, and epidermolysis bullosa.2Onychomadesis following HFMD is a self-limiting condition with subsequent normal nail regrowth within weeks.

He was transported to a local emergency department. Following a difficult orotracheal intubation with multiple attempts, the infant was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit with a presumptive diagnosis of bronchiolitis. During the next 2 days, he was weaned off mechanical ventilation and received oxygen via the nasal cannula. He began feeding orally and was transferred to the general inpatient floor. At the time of transfer, the patient was noted to have choking with feeds as well as a large volume of clear oral secretions that required frequent suctioning. Based on these clinical findings, oral food and fluids were withheld from the patient and a fluoroscopic video swallowing study (FVSS) was performed (Figure 1 and Video). What Is Your Diagnosis?",Gastroesophageal reflux,Tracheoesophageal fistula,Esophageal perforation,Aspiration,C. Esophageal perforation,C,Esophageal perforation,"The FVSS demonstrated a perforation of the proximal oropharynx/esophagus with contrast filling a false lumen posterior to the esophagus. During the imaging study, the barium was noted to extend along the lower cervical and upper thoracic levels, with a distinct entry and exit point.An FVSS helps to distinguish between a wide differential diagnosis in the choking infant. The appearance seen on this infant’s study was diagnostic of esophageal perforation. Other diagnoses considered on the differential for a choking infant might have been distinguished by this study. Gastroesophageal reflux events can be seen on the FVSS, noted as passive regurgitation into the upper esophagus following swallowing. Tracheoesophageal fistulas can be diagnosed on FVSS if contrast is seen passing from the esophagus into the trachea below the level of the vocal cords. Vocal cord paralysis can be seen with traumatic intubations and can lead to aspiration. Although vocal cord paralysis cannot be visualized on the FVSS, aspiration would appear as contrast passing through the vocal cords and into the lungs. Finally, a laryngocele, an outpouching of the laryngeal ventricles, can cause choking. This would be apparent on the FVSS as a collection of contrast above the vocal cords.The patient remained stable with no signs of respiratory distress or sepsis. To facilitate feeding, a nasojejunal tube was placed under fluoroscopic guidance to prevent accidental placement into the false lumen and feeding into the mediastinum. All nasopharyngeal suctioning below the pharynx was terminated to avoid further trauma to the area. The patient received intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam as prophylaxis for mediastinitis. The pediatric otolaryngology service was consulted for management.Shortly thereafter, the patient was taken to the operating room where he underwent microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (Figure 2A). This study confirmed the presence of a large false tract on the right, posterior to the true esophagus. The tract ended in a blind pouch. Owing to the location and appearance of the esophageal defect, the patient was diagnosed as having an iatrogenic perforation caused by intubation.A, A nasogastric tube is shown entering the esophageal inlet in an endoscopic photograph of the postcricoid region. A large false tract is clearly visible to the right posterior of the esophagus, which ends in a blind pouch. B, In follow-up, a nasogastric tube is seen entering the esophageal inlet. The previously seen false tract has completely healed.Esophageal perforation is rare in children, with only 8 cases at 1 pediatric hospital in a 15-year period.1 Esophageal perforations are potentially life threatening and may quickly lead to mediastinitis and/or sepsis in the absence of treatment.1,2 For that reason, broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended.3 Esophageal perforations may be spontaneous (eg, Boerhaave phenomena), traumatic, or, most commonly, iatrogenic. Iatrogenic etiologies include complications of esophageal dilatation, endoscopy, enteric tube insertion, endotracheal intubation, and respiratory suction-catheter use.1,2In adults, esophageal perforations are most commonly treated via a surgical approach.3 Increasingly, children are being successfully treated though nonoperative management.1,4,5In our patient, the perforation was successfully managed via a conservative approach. Through direct visualization in the operating room, a repogle suction tube was placed in the blind pouch and placed to low continuous suction to keep the cavity free of secretions. This tube was slowly withdrawn approximately 0.5 cm every 2 days to allow upward healing of the perforation from the dependent portion.Oral food and fluids were withheld from the infant during the period of healing and feeding was done through a nasojejunal tube. Prophylactic antibiotics were continued for the duration of healing. The esophagus was revisualized both directly and via esophagram at approximately 1 and 2 weeks after the initial diagnosis. These studies confirmed progressive healing. Ten days after the initial diagnosis, the infant had complete healing of the esophagus and was able to resume oral feedings (Figure 2B).

Results of a subsequent dermatophyte screening of the scalp lesion were positive for Trichophyton tonsurans. The patient was treated with an 8-week course of oral griseofulvin (20 mg/kg/d), an 8-week course of ketoconazole shampoo (2%), and a 9-day course of oral prednisone started at 1 mg/kg/d and tapered to discontinuation. Evaluation 1 week after presentation revealed resolution of drainage and crusting and decreased size of the nodule (Figure 2).View 1 week after initiation of therapy showing resolution of the suppurative discharge and decreased size and redness of the nodule.Tinea capitis, a dermatophyte infection of the scalp, is the most common fungal infection in children.1 Most tinea capitis infections (>90%) in the United States are caused by T tonsurans.1-4 The next most common dermatophyte is Microsporum canis. In addition to the traditional presentation of scaly, annular patches with hair loss, there are several inflammatory forms of tinea capitis, such as kerion celsi, which is an intense, localized hypersensitivity reaction to the presence of a dermatophyte.1,5 Clinically, kerion celsi presents as a large, boggy, swollen, painful, indurated plaque or nodule with purulent discharge and loss of hair throughout the lesion. It is often accompanied by regional lymphadenopathy.2,3,5The accurate and timely diagnosis of kerion celsi is important. Misdiagnosis of a kerion may result in permanent scarring, alopecia, or unnecessary incision and drainage.4 Improper treatment of this inflammatory lesion with topical corticosteroids, topical antibiotics, or topical antifungals alone may result in progression.Kerions should be treated with systemic antifungal medications in addition to antifungal shampoos to prevent further shedding of the dermatophyte.1,2,4 There is some debate about the use of topical or oral corticosteroids as part of the treatment of kerions.6 Many suggest the use of corticosteroids because kerions present with intense inflammation and the use of these corticosteroids may allow quicker recovery and preservation of hair.6,7 One small study does not support the use of corticosteroids in kerion celsi.6 Topical keratolytics and gentle soaks can aid in removal of the thick crust that develops on the surface of the kerion.4 Positive dermatophyte screening results based on swabs of the affected area will distinguish Trichophyton and Microsporum species and may guide the choice of systemic antifungal therapy.3 Standard systemic agents include griseofulvin (20 mg/kg/d for at least 8 weeks or until mycologic cure) or terbinafine (weight-based dosing for 4-6 weeks).1,3 Kerions should also be cultured to ensure there is no superinfection with bacteria.Timely diagnosis and treatment of a kerion will facilitate resolution of inflammation and improve chances for full recovery of hair.

Tinea capitis,C,Tinea capitis,"The differential diagnosis for these annular lesions included tinea capitis, neonatal lupus erythematosus, and other annular eruptions (including annular erythema of infancy, autoinflammatory syndromes, erythema annulare centrifugum, annular urticaria, and granuloma annulare). On admission, a dermatophyte screening test was performed, and the dermatophyte test medium ultimately grew Trichophyton tonsurans. Samples for a bacterial culture were obtained from a pustule, and the results were negative for herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus using polymerase chain reaction. Given the concern that the neonate might have neonatal lupus erythematosus, the results of an antinuclear antibody profile (including antibodies to SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La, and ribonucleoprotein [RNP]) were negative, and an electrocardiogram showed no evidence of a heart block. An antinuclear antibody profile was also performed on the mother, and the results were unremarkable.Although tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection in children, it is rarely seen during the neonatal period. The prevalence among school-aged children is 6.6%, with the highest prevalence among African American children (12.9%).1 To our knowledge, there are only several published case reports of tinea capitis among neonates, with the earliest published presentation at 2 weeks of life.2Tinea capitis is most commonly caused by T tonsurans and typically presents with asymptomatic erythematous annular scaling plaques with patchy alopecia and varying degrees of inflammation. There can be a single lesion or multiple lesions, and they commonly involve the scalp and face. It is acquired via close contact with an infected individual. Treatment with systemic antifungal therapy allows for penetration of the pilosebaceous unit and the hair shaft. Because the safety of using oral antifungal agents for patients younger than 2 years of age has not been rigorously studied, topical antifungals have been used instead for this age group, with successful resolution of the lesions.3,4In addition to considering the diagnosis of tinea capitis for a neonate with annular plaques on the scalp and face, it is also important to rule out neonatal lupus erythematosus while awaiting culture results. Neonatal lupus erythematosus is a self-limited autoimmune disease caused by the transplacental passive transfer of maternal IgG SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La, or U1RNP antibodies, often in mothers with no symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus or Sjögren syndrome. The antibodies result in cutaneous annular lesions with a predilection for the upper face and periorbital region, and these lesions tend to worsen when exposed to sunlight. However, they may occur on anatomic sites protected from the sun. The lesions are not typically present at birth but develop during the first weeks of life. The most serious manifestations of neonatal lupus erythematosus include an irreversible heart block and reversible laboratory abnormalities, including elevated liver enzyme levels and thrombocytopenia. Although a complete heart block only occurs in 1% to 2% of infants born to mothers with SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La antibodies, the risk increases to 15% to 30% in babies with cutaneous findings.5 Thus, it is important to evaluate neonates presenting with an annular eruption using electrocardiography and an antibody profile, even in the absence of overt maternal disease.The differential diagnosis includes annular erythema of infancy, with a familial form that can appear shortly after birth (beginning with small papules that evolve into annular urticarial plaques). Erythema annulare centrifugum is characterized by fine scaling and is more commonly seen on the trunk. Annular urticaria is a benign hypersensitivity reaction leading to pruritic, blanchable annular lesions and acral edema. However, severe recalcitrant urticaria among young infants and children may also be a sign of systemic autoinflammatory conditions. Lastly, granuloma annulare causes annular plaques that can be distinguished from tinea by their lack of scale and by their predilection for the hands and feet.",Pediatrics,"A 24-day-old African American boy born at full term via an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery presented with a 7-day history of annular plaques on the upper forehead and scalp (Figure).

Streptobacillus moniliformis infection,B,Streptobacillus moniliformis infection,"On further questioning, the patient described suddenly awakening at night with a bloody lesion on her lip 7 days before symptom onset. The lesion became painful and swollen, but completely healed within 4 days. In addition, an indoor puppy acquired a similar lesion around that time.Streptobacillus moniliformis was isolated from an anaerobic blood culture. The patient was given intravenous penicillin and became afebrile within 48 hours. The rash and arthralgias improved gradually during the subsequent 7 days. She received intravenous antibiotics for 10 days before being discharged from the hospital to complete 7 additional days of oral penicillin.Streptobacillus moniliformis is the predominant cause of rat bite fever (RBF) in the Western hemisphere, while Spirillum minus can cause RBF in Asia. Both organisms colonize the upper respiratory tracts of rodents. Infections in humans typically occur following the scratch or bite of a colonized rodent. Rarely, infections occur after ingesting contaminated food products; these infections are referred to as Haverhill fever.Rat bite fever is characterized by fever, rash, and arthralgias. Fever develops in most patients (>90%), occurring 3 to 10 days after exposure. It can resolve spontaneously, although it tends to persist in a relapsing pattern in the absence of antibiotic therapy. Most patients (65%) experience migratory polyarthralgias of the large and small joints, resembling disseminated gonococcal infection.1 A rash with a maculopapular, petechial, or purpuric appearance involving the extremities, particularly the hands and feet, develops in 60% of cases.1 Tender hemorrhagic vesicles can occur and, if present in the setting of an otherwise nonspecific febrile illness, suggests RBF. Complications are rare and include focal abscesses, endocarditis, polyarteritis nodosa, pneumonia, and meningitis. Endocarditis has 53% mortality.2The presentation of fever, rash, and arthralgias evokes a broad differential diagnosis. Sepsis from Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae must be considered when selecting empirical antibiotics. Tick-borne infections (Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and ehrlichiosis), brucellosis, and viruses (enterovirus and parvovirus B19) can have a similar presentation. Kawasaki disease should be considered. Noninfectious considerations include drug reactions and rheumatologic conditions. The extensive differential diagnosis highlights the importance of obtaining a detailed history of animal exposure.The diagnosis of RBF is difficult owing to challenges in the isolation of the causative organism. Streptobacillus moniliformis is an aerobic, fastidious, gram-negative rod. It is straight or fusiform, with bulbar swellings that resemble a necklace, inspiring its name (moniliformis, or “string of beads”). Unfortunately, sodium polyanethol sulfonate, an anticoagulant found in most aerobic blood culture bottles, inhibits S moniliformis growth. Anaerobic blood culture bottles, which lack sodium polyanethol sulfonate, are more likely to yield the organism. Molecular-based assays have successfully identified S moniliformis but are not commercially available.3Penicillin given intravenously for at least 7 to 10 days is the recommended treatment for children.4 For penicillin-allergic patients, doxycycline hyclate, streptomycin sulfate, or gentamicin sulfate can be used. Disc diffusion testing has demonstrated susceptibility to penicillin, tetracycline hydrochloride, gentamicin, and vancomycin hydrochloride.5Overall, RBF has a favorable outcome when recognized and treated. However, when untreated, mortality approaches 10%, according to a review1 of adult and pediatric cases. Of 4 fatal pediatric cases that have been published, 3 occurred in young children presenting with fever and bite marks for which the etiology remained unidentified until postmortem examination.6,7 The other fatal pediatric case was an 8-year-old with S moniliformis endocarditis.Because S moniliformis is not a reportable pathogen, there is limited information on its incidence in the United States. A California study8 found increased numbers of infections during the 1990s compared with previous decades. With increased crowding and urbanization across the United States, pediatricians need to consider RBF in children with unexplained fever.",Pediatrics,"A 16-year-old girl presented with fever, rash, and diffuse pain for 5 days.

Thin-walled, branching hemangiopericytic vessels are typical morphologic features of myofibromas. D, Immunohistochemical staining for smooth muscle actin identifying myofibroblasts, consistent with myofibromas (magnification ×40).Infantile myofibromatosis (IM) is a benign tumor disease considered the most common fibrous tumor of infancy (1:400 000 incidence). Initially described in the 1950s by Stout, the descriptive name of this disorder was coined by Chung and Enzinger in 1981 based on histologic features and typical age at presentation.1 Ninety percent of myofibromas are detected during the first year of life, with 60% found at birth or soon after. The presence of more than one mass meets criteria for myofibromatosis. Patients are at risk for developing more myofibromas until approximately 2 years of age.Myofibromas can occur in any mesodermal tissue, including soft tissues, spleen, and liver. Histologic evaluation shows well-circumscribed masses of spindle-shaped cells that stain as fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells, thus suggesting their origin. Cellular atypia is absent, which distinguishes the myofibromas from malignant or premalignant tumors.2Of the 3 types of myofibromas (solitary, multicentric with visceral involvement, and multicentric without visceral involvement), the most frequent is solitary, in which a single lesion affects the skin or muscle, usually on the head, neck, or trunk. This type has a nearly 2:1 male predominance.1 Multicentric types are more common in females,3 more likely to be congenital,3 and, in addition to visceral involvement, can affect other soft tissues or bone.The differential diagnosis for IM encompasses structures from cysts to malignant tumors. Cyst diagnoses include dermoid, thyroglossal duct, branchial cleft, epidermal, and subcutaneous fat necrosis. Tumors in the differential diagnosis include infantile hemangioma, neurofibroma, leiomyoma, sarcoma, and metastatic neuroblastoma.4 Most cases are sporadic, but case reports suggest variable inheritance patterns ranging from autosomal dominant with variable penetrance5 to autosomal recessive.6The natural history of IM without visceral involvement is typically benign, with spontaneous involution of lesions within 2 years of life.3 It may be fatal, though, in infants with the multicentric form and extensive visceral involvement, especially lung involvement. Therefore, surveillance is essential and involves radiographic survey to detect other lesions as well as close observation for the development of additional soft-tissue lesions without visceral involvement. No algorithm exists to guide management with excision vs observation, but given the likelihood of spontaneous regression, a conservative approach with observation is advocated by most, with surgical excision considered on a case-by-case basis. For example, visceral myofibromas that are rapidly progressing or whose location suggests risk of functional impairment should be surgically excised. Spontaneous recurrence is unusual, and myofibromas diagnosed after 2 years of age are likely due to incomplete initial resection and can be re-excised or treated with chemotherapy.2",Pediatrics,"A newborn presented on the first day of life with a chest mass found on initial examination in the nursery (Figure 1).

Her mother reported the lesion appeared at age 3 months, was previously diagnosed as a hemangioma, and was treated with observation. She also reported the lesion originated as a “cystlike papule” that had continuously expanded. In addition to causing cosmetic concerns, the lesion seemed to be irritated by clothing and would occasionally bleed and swell. The patient denied pain or itching associated with the lesion. Since its appearance at 3 months of age, several abscesses formed underneath the region of concern requiring incision and drainage. Medical history revealed no other medical problems.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Microcystic lymphatic malformation,Congenital melanocytic nevus,Venous malformation,Nevus sebaceous,A. Microcystic lymphatic malformation,A,Microcystic lymphatic malformation,"Microscopy showed multiple thin-walled, dilated lymphatic channels containing valvelike papillary projections within the papillary dermis, closely approximated to the overlying acanthotic, hyperkeratotic epidermis. The rete ridges were elongated and appeared to surround the lymphatic spaces. Ultrasonography was performed to rule out underlying venous and arterial malformations and showed no evidence of a vascular structure in the subcutaneous tissue, no flow on color Doppler, and no cystic regions. The patient elected to not undergo treatment.Microcystic lymphatic malformations (“lymphangioma circumscriptum”) are characterized clinically by discrete or grouped translucent, fluid-filled vesicles said to resemble frog spawn. Occasionally, vesicles can be hyperkeratotic and blood tinged.1-3 Underlying deep pulsatile lymphatic cisterns extending into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue are present at birth and thought to communicate with the superficial lymphatic system, giving rise to the clinical appearance described. Clinically, superficial lesions may take several months to years to initially present. While these lymphatic cisterns are not thought to communicate with the normal systemic lymphatic system, this complex channel of connections may explain why these lesions are difficult to eradicate, especially if the extent of the lesions is not fully characterized initially with imaging.4Broadly, lymphatic malformations are divided into macrocystic and microcystic variants. Oftentimes, it is difficult to distinguish between the variants without first obtaining ultrasonography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. Macrocystic lymphatic malformations (“cystic hygroma”) present clinically as soft subcutaneous nodules to large soft tissue masses filled with lymph.5 The microcystic types are subdivided into a classic form and a localized form. The classic form, as in our patient, has a predilection for the proximal upper and lower limbs, as well as the perineum, buttocks, axilla, and shoulders, and appears at birth or within the first year of life with areas of involvement greater than 1 cm.2 The localized form is reserved for lesions less than 1 cm, appearing at any time, and involving any body area.2 Lesions may be asymptomatic, or patients may present with drainage from ruptured vesicles and abscesses from Staphylococcus aureus infection.3 Etiology is unknown, with no clear genetic link noted in the literature.Diagnosis can be challenging when vesicles are blood tinged and can lead to a misdiagnosis of hemangioma, as was the case in our patient. In contrast, a hemangioma of infancy has a characteristic growth pattern showing the majority of growth in the first year of life, a plateau phase, and gradual shrinkage over the childhood years and this pattern would differ from a lymphatic malformation that gradually grows over time. Weeping with trauma is virtually diagnostic of a lymphatic malformation. Other common cutaneous manifestations to consider in the differential diagnosis include warts, molluscum contagiosum, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and dermatitis herpetiformis and, less commonly, angiokeratoma, lymphangioendothelioma, low-grade angiosarcoma, and eccrine hydrocystoma.2,3A punch biopsy can be useful and will show large, deep muscular lymphatic cisterns extending deep into the dermis and subcutaneous tissues. Extending upward, the cisterns typically communicate with a dilated superficial lymphatic system just below the epidermis and red blood cells can be found within.2-4Imaging is important to make the diagnosis, determine the extent of the underlying lesion, and rule out an underlying arteriovenous malformation. Ultrasonography is a reasonable, cost-effective imaging option. Lymphangiogram is a newer magnetic resonance imaging modality that will assess the extent of the lesion.Treatment of lymphangioma circumscriptum has been a contentious issue in the literature. Sclerotherapy and surgical excision are 2 of the more widely used therapeutic approaches. Sclerotherapy is widely considered the best option, particularly in macrocystic lesions. Radiologically guided injection of the sclerosing agent OK-432 into deeper areas of dermis has been shown to be effective in a large study for limited numbers of cysts (<5) alone or pretreatment in combination with surgical excision.2,6 Recently, radiofrequency ablation and sclerotherapy together have been shown to be effective in a small study in which 9 of 10 patients showed greater than 90% resolution.1Surgical excision offers the lowest documented recurrence rate (17%)2 but must be down to the deep subcutaneous tissue to ensure that low-lying lymphatic cisterns are removed. Thus, this option is most effective for small lesions. Obtaining frozen sections to ensure negative margins has shown to be beneficial. Incomplete removal is thought to be a source of recurrence.2 Additionally, surgical excision may not be the best cosmetic option. Other treatment modalities have gained favor in the literature and include suction-assisted lipectomy, argon laser phototherapy, radiotherapy, carbon dioxide and pulsed dye laser, and sclerotherapy.1 Laser therapies and radiofrequency ablation can be effective for superficial lesions but cannot reach deeper cisterns, thus leading to a higher recurrence rate. Malignant transformation is extremely rare and has only been described in 3 instances, so in the absence of patient dissatisfaction, strict observation without aggressive treatment is a reasonable approach.6-8",Pediatrics,"An 8-year-old girl presented to the dermatology clinic for further evaluation of a lesion over the right posterior thigh (Figure, A).

Incontinentia pigmenti,B,Incontinentia pigmenti,"For an infant who presents with vesicular lesions, herpes simplex virus should always be at the top of the differential diagnosis. The patient started acyclovir treatment. Lesion scrapings were performed, and the results of direct immunofluorescence assay and culture were negative for herpes simplex virus. The Dermatology Department was consulted, and the morphology of the lesions, with whorled and linear deep-seated papulovesicles following the lines of Blaschko, were suggestive of incontinentia pigmenti. To confirm the diagnosis, a punch biopsy was performed and showed an eosinophil-rich epidermal spongiosis and interstitial dermatitis, consistent with the vesicular stage of incontinentia pigmenti.Incontinentia pigmenti is an X-linked dominant syndrome associated with mutations in the IKBKG gene located at locus Xq28 and is typically seen in female patients.1,2 The skin lesions in incontinentia pigmenti are characterized by 4 stages (vesicular, verrucous, hyperpigmented, and hypopigmented/atrophic), and the sequence and duration of these stages can vary and overlap. Skin lesions are present at birth in approximately 50% of cases. In 90% of cases, the skin lesions will appear in the first 2 weeks of life, but they eventually develop in all patients.3 The vesicular stage is characterized by erythema and superficial vesicles in a linear or whorled distribution following the lines of Blaschko. In most cases, these lesions are found on the torso and extremities, sparing the face, and clear by 4 months of age. The verrucous stage consists of linearly arranged verrucous papules or plaques. These may or may not correlate with the location of the prior vesicles and will generally clear by 6 months of age.4 The hyperpigmented stage is characterized by whorls or streaks of brown to slate-gray pigmentation following the lines of Blaschko. Hyperpigmentation is most commonly found on the torso and extremities; however, it does not tend to correspond with the location of prior vesicles.4 The hyperpigmented lesions tend to persist for many years and, for most patients, will resolve by puberty or adulthood. The hypopigmented/atrophic stage is the final stage and consists of the permanent sequelae of incontinentia pigmenti lesions, with subtle atrophic patches most commonly found on the extremities, especially the posterior calves.4The most common noncutaneous finding in incontinentia pigmenti is dental and can present as adontia or conical deformities of the teeth. Other associated findings of incontinentia pigmenti include scarring alopecia, dystrophic nail changes, and ophthalmic and neurologic anomalies.5 Ocular involvement can be classified as nonretinal, most commonly strabismus, and retinal, typically secondary to vaso-occlusive events and ischemia.4 Retinal involvement can be progressive and can result in retinal detachment and blindness.6 Central nervous system manifestations occur in approximately one-third of affected patients and include seizures, mental retardation, and spastic paralysis.5Although incontinentia pigmenti is classified as an X-linked dominant syndrome that is lethal for male patients, a small number of surviving male patients have been reported.7 Three potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain the survival of male patients with incontinentia pigmenti carrying the IKBKG mutation: abnormal karyotypes, hypomorphic mutations, and mosaicism.8 The infant in our case had a normal male sibling, and the mother never had a miscarriage, leading us to believe that findings in our patient favor mosaicism. However, a Klinefelter syndrome (XXY chromosome complement) genetic composition cannot be ruled out and is one of the mechanisms by which male patients may survive the effects of inheriting a lethal incontinentia pigmenti mutation because this karyotype establishes a heterozygous genotype that is compatible with survival.7Treatment of incontinentia pigmenti skin lesions consists of symptomatic management with emollients and with antibiotics in cases of secondary infection.3 Because patients can have associated ophthalmologic and central nervous system manifestations, close follow-up with the neurology and ophthalmology departments are recommended. In the rare case that incontinentia pigmenti is diagnosed for a male patient, further evaluation by a geneticist is also recommended because male patients likely have underlying abnormal karyotypes or mosaicism.",Pediatrics,"A 6-day-old male infant presented to the emergency department with a linear band of skin-colored papules on his left upper extremity.

Coccidioidomycosis,C,Coccidioidomycosis,"Histologic examination of the excised lymph node revealed necrotizing lymphadenitis with multiple spherules containing endospores (Figure, C). Fungal culture of the biopsy specimen grew Coccidioides immitis. The coccidioidal complement fixation titer was 1:256.Initially, the differential diagnosis for this patient’s condition included tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, and a hematologic malignant neoplasm. However, the tenderness observed on examination and the erythematous appearance suggestive of inflammation made the diagnosis of malignant neoplasm less likely. The long-term presentation and the spontaneous drainage were suggestive of tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis, despite the negative tuberculin skin test result. An excisional biopsy of the lymph node was performed. An incisional lymph node biopsy and a fine-needle aspiration should be avoided when mycobacterial lymphadenitis is suspected because these infections tend to heal poorly and to recur without complete excision.1Coccidioidomycosis is caused by 2 species, Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii. C immitis is a soil fungus endemic to the San Joaquin Valley of California, whereas C posadasii has a wider distribution, including the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and Central and South America.2 The clinical manifestations of infection with these 2 species are identical. The incidence of coccidioidomycosis has been increasing over the past decade.2Coccidioidomycosis has 3 main presentations: acute primary respiratory infection, chronic or residual respiratory disease, and disseminated infection. Primary respiratory infection can be asymptomatic or manifest as pneumonia. Chest radiographic findings include lobar, interstitial, or reticulonodular infiltrates; consolidation; hilar adenopathy; and pleural effusions. Chronic pulmonary sequelae such as cavitations or nodules occur in 5% to 10% of cases.3 Disseminated disease most commonly involves the skin, bones, joints, and central nervous system.2 Risk factors for disseminated infection include immunosuppression; immunodeficiency; pregnancy; and African American, Filipino, or Native American descent.2 As with our patient, approximately half of patients with disseminated coccidioidomycosis have a history suggestive of a primary respiratory infection in the previous few months.4Serologic tests are useful for initial diagnosis, ascertaining prognosis, and treatment. Qualitative testing for coccidioidal IgM, measured by immunodiffusion, can be detected between the first and third weeks.5 Quantitative testing of coccidioidal IgG titers are determined by complement fixation and can be detected between weeks 2 and 28.2,6 Low complement fixation titers suggest a favorable prognosis, whereas titers greater than 1:16 portend disseminated disease.7 A definitive diagnosis is made with tissue biopsy and fungal cultures. Tissue biopsy specimens showing characteristic spherules containing endospores are pathognomonic.Antifungal treatment of disseminated coccidioidomycosis requires an azole or amphotericin B preparation. Oral fluconazole and itraconazole are most commonly used.3 Itraconazole may be more effective than fluconazole for patients with nonmeningeal disease.8,9 Fluconazole is dosed at 400 to 800 mg/d, and itraconazole at 400 mg/d.3,4 Amphotericin B preparations are reserved for more serious infections and for pregnant women.10 Treatment of nonmeningeal disseminated coccidioidomycosis should continue for at least 1 year and until evidence of infection is resolved.6 Patients with osseus lesions require a longer duration of therapy. During treatment, complement fixation titers should be checked every 3 to 6 months. A value above 1:8 raises concern for persistent infection. After discontinuing therapy, we recommend obtaining titers at 6 months. An increase of greater than 2 dilutions (4-fold) suggests treatment failure.Coccidioidomycosis presenting with bilateral cervical adenopathy is uncommon; however, the diagnosis should be considered for patients with residence in or history of travel to endemic areas and a subacute presentation of lymphadenitis. Mortality rates associated with disseminated coccidioidomycosis have been reported to be as high as 28%.4 Early recognition and treatment can decrease the likelihood of morbidity and mortality.",Pediatrics,"An 18-year-old Hispanic man residing in Los Angeles, California, presented with bilateral masses at the base of his neck, which he had for 2 months.

The results of a biopsy of the right lacrimal gland confirmed chronic inflammatory changes. Evaluation for an infectious cause was unrevealing, with negative rapid plasma reagin, treponemal antibody, Bartonella henselae IgG and IgM, and Lyme borreliosis IgG. Results of a complete blood cell count were unremarkable, including a leukocyte count that was within the reference range. Rheumatologic workup showed levels within the reference ranges for antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and HLA-antigen B27. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level were mildly elevated. Peripheral flow cytometry performed using the biopsy sample was negative. With an angiotensin-converting enzyme level within the reference range and no abnormal pulmonary findings or rash, rheumatologists excluded sarcoidosis. With the exclusion of infection, malignant disease, and rheumatologic disease, bilateral idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (IOIS) was diagnosed. After a 4-day course of corticosteroids, the patient’s condition improved, and the therapy was transitioned to a 1-month tapering regimen at discharge. To provide better control for refractory disease, corticosteroid-sparing therapy was initiated with methotrexate sodium, 15 mg per week. Our patient remained symptom free at follow-up 4 months after discharge.Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome, also known as orbital pseudotumor, was first described by Birch-Hirschfield in 1905.1 Although characterized by inflammation of the tissues surrounding the orbit, IOIS is neither infectious nor neoplastic.2 Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome usually occurs in adults, but up to 17% of the cases have been reported in children.2,3 Typically, the extraocular muscles, lacrimal glands, and orbital fat are affected.4 When inflammation is localized to one structure, it is termed myositis or dacryoadenitis, accordingly.5 Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome can present as a palpable mass (ie, pseudotumor). Differential diagnoses include malignant diseases (eg, rhabdomyosarcoma, retinoblastoma, and lymphoma), infections (orbital cellulitis), and autoimmune conditions (eg, thyroid ophthalmopathy, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and sarcoidosis).6,7A 1978 case series2 identified clinical characteristics found in 29 childhood cases of IOIS, the most common being pain, swelling, ptosis, photophobia, and proptosis. Unlike adults, children were more likely to have bilateral disease, with bilateral cases reported in 45% of the children. Pediatric cases were more often associated with trauma. Children with bilateral disease were more likely to have corticosteroid-dependent refractory disease. Children frequently had systemic symptoms, such as headache, anorexia, fever, and malaise.2,5The diagnosis of IOIS is one of exclusion. The complete blood cell count and inflammatory markers usually are within normal limits. However, mild elevation of the leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as well as eosinophilia, may be seen.8 Computed tomography or MRI may identify enlargement of periorbital tissues, including muscles and tendons. Dacryoadenitis and myositis are common findings in IOIS. Any bone involvement argues against IOIS and suggests infection or malignant disease. Biopsy can be used to diagnose IOIS and exclude malignant disease.4 The biopsy specimen typically shows a mixture of inflammatory cells, especially lymphocytes.3 The Mottow and Jakobiec2 study reported increased residua of disease in patients with IOIS who underwent biopsy. Thus, biopsy is advised only for atypical presentation, poor response to corticosteroids, or suspected malignant disease.3Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy for IOIS.6 Many patients improve with short courses of corticosteroids and do not require long-term immunosuppression. In cases that recur or are resistant to corticosteroid treatment, immunomodulatory agents can be used for long-term management.9 In one case report,7 IOIS in a 14-year-old girl was treated successfully with a regimen of azathioprine sodium, cyclosporine, and low-dose prednisone. Another report10 described the use of methotrexate and infliximab to treat refractory IOIS in a 15-year-old boy. Although immunomodulatory agents may produce adverse effects, they can be therapeutic for refractory disease and avoid the complications associated with extended use of corticosteroids.",Pediatrics,"An adolescent boy presented to our hospital with a 5-day history of right eyelid swelling and redness accompanied by blurred vision and pain with ocular movement.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Fixed drug eruption,Tinea corporis,Lyme disease,Granuloma annulare,C. Lyme disease,C,Lyme disease,"Given the patient’s viral-like symptoms and classic lesions of erythema chronicum migrans (EM), Lyme disease was strongly suspected. Outpatient treatment with doxycycline hyclate, 100 mg for 14 days, was initiated. An electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities. The result for Lyme IgM and IgG antibody on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was positive at a Lyme Index Value of 7.41 (a positive Lyme Index Value is >1.09). No Western blot confirmation was performed. The rash and fever rapidly resolved with treatment.Lyme disease in the United States is heavily concentrated in the northeast and Great Lakes regions and caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. Transmission of the bacteria occurs via an infected Ixodes tick. To transmit the disease to a human host, the tick must have been attached for 36 to 72 hours and become engorged before the bacteria will move from the tick’s midgut to the salivary glands.1,2 More than 24 000 confirmed cases of Lyme disease were reported in 2011.3 Risk of infection is highest in late spring and summer. A known tick bite is not required to make the diagnosis.Lyme disease occurs in 3 stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late disseminated. Early localized disease presents with the EM rash in 60% to 80% of cases.1 Although classically shaped like a bull’s-eye or target, it is most commonly red without central clearing and can even be ecchymotic or vesicular in appearance.4 The EM rash develops 3 to 30 days after tick contact and is often accompanied by symptoms including headache, fever, malaise, myalgias, and arthralgias.2 Failure to recognize EM in patients with early Lyme disease can result in delayed or missed diagnosis, ineffective antibiotic treatment, and manifestations of late disease.5 Because EM is usually asymptomatic, a full skin examination and high index of clinical suspicion are required for patients with viral symptoms in a Lyme disease–endemic area.Multiple EM lesions, like those in our patient, are the most common sign of early disseminated disease.2 These lesions are often smaller than the initial EM rash and lack central clearing. Continuation of systemic flulike symptoms, cranial nerve palsies, meningitis, and carditis are also possible. Patients with suspected disseminated disease and neurologic symptoms should undergo lumbar puncture. Electrocardiography may also be helpful to identify asymptomatic conduction abnormalities that may require intravenous antibiotics. The late stage includes arthritis, polyneuropathy, encephalitis, and encephalopathy. Coinfection with other tick-borne illnesses may be as high as 15% and should be considered in any patient with Lyme disease and atypical symptoms or incomplete response to treatment.1Lyme disease that meets certain clinical definitions is reportable to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention introduced the categories of probable and suspected Lyme disease, increasing the spectrum of the disease to include seropositive cases without classic EM.6 Patients with a high pretest probability (eg, classic EM, Lyme disease symptoms, exposure) do not necessarily require testing and should be treated regardless of seropositivity.1 In less straightforward cases when the diagnosis must be confirmed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend an initial IgM and IgG Lyme disease enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with any equivocal or positive test results undergoing confirmatory IgG and IgM Western blot. It is not a useful screening test owing to false-positive results, and patients with early disease may have false-negative results while antibodies develop. Procedures like B burgdorferi culture or polymerase chain reaction require tissue samples and are limited in their availability, reliability, and practicality.While fixed drug eruption is part of the differential diagnosis for our patient, it is unlikely for several reasons. First, she has not had any changes to her medications, and fixed drug eruption occurs with each administration of the drug in the same place(s). Second, the lesions are asymptomatic, whereas fixed drug eruption is usually pruritic. Finally, while ibuprofen is a new medication for her and a common offender with fixed drug eruption, this diagnosis would not explain her systemic symptoms.",Pediatrics,"A 13-year-old girl with a history of Crohn disease presented to the pediatric dermatology clinic for evaluation of a rash on her buttocks and back.

The suffix -oma was used for neoplasms and malformations. As understanding of pathogenesis increases, older terms no longer characterize the lesion accurately. Many dermatologists now follow the classification system of the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies.1Lymphatic malformations may consist of 1 or more cysts and arise by faulty migration or formation of lymphatic endothelium during embryogenesis.2,3 They are macrocystic (cysts >1 cm) or microcystic (cysts <1 cm).2 Macrocystic lymphatic malformations typically do not involve the overlying skin and include those formerly referred to as cystic hygromas and cavernous lymphangiomas.Verrucous lymphatic malformation is a cutaneous malformation. Cutaneous lymphatic malformations may occur anywhere on the skin and most often appear as plaques or nodules with overlying small translucent papules or vesicles. Verrucous thickening can make diagnosis challenging,1 and the lesion is often underrecognized and mistaken for common or genital warts, epidermal nevus, verrucous hemangiomas, or malignancies.4,5 These lesions are not proliferative, but some may grow by means of distention or hypertrophy as the child grows.3 Complications may include failure of lymphatic drainage, localized pain, bleeding, or crusting.6Ultrasonography and MRI allow visualization and delineate the lesion’s extent; imaging can be useful in the diagnosis and is important when considering biopsy or excision. In our patient, MRI of the right medial thigh showed a 4-cm superficial lesion, which enhanced superficially with contrast. The lesion did not involve underlying bone or muscle, and there was no involvement of the great vessels of the leg. The lesion was excised to confirm diagnosis and for therapeutic reasons. In lesions that are not primarily superficial and have more of a deep component, outright complete surgical excision may not be possible and may put the patient at risk for infection or recurrence. Biopsy can be helpful when the diagnosis is uncertain but may not be necessary in many cases. Liquid nitrogen treatment would be ineffective for a large lesion, and aggressive liquid nitrogen could lead to pain, blistering, infection, and scarring.Histopathology of lymphatic malformations often shows dermal, thin-walled vessels with flat endothelium (Figure 2A), which is immunopositive for podoplanin,2 a transmembrane mucoprotein expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells. It may be stained using D2-40, a monoclonal antibody (Figure 2B). CD31 and CD34 highlight both blood vessel and lymphatic endothelium.4 The lymphatic lumens are empty or filled with a proteinaceous fluid containing macrophages and lymphocytes. Malformations that are verrucous clinically will have hyperkeratotic and acanthotic epithelium. Our specimen’s histopathology had a well-circumscribed mass with thin-walled lymphatic vessels staining positive for CD31 and D2-40. There was overlying epidermal hyperplasia and acanthosis, confirming the diagnosis.A, Hematoxylin-eosin stain demonstrating dermal, thin-walled vessels with flat endothelium. B, Histopathology with D2-40 staining, which stains positive in the presence of lymphatic endothelium. Original magnifications ×10.Treatment is not necessary in asymptomatic lesions. If desired, small superficial lesions may be treated using electrocoagulation, laser, or cryotherapy. However, results from these treatments are inconsistent, not necessarily definitive, and not without adverse effects. If practical, surgical resection is the treatment of choice for superficial, symptomatic, or well-circumscribed lymphatic malformations.5 Complete resection is preferred to minimize the risk for secondary infection and recurrence, which occurs at a rate of 40% after an incomplete excision and 17% after a macroscopically complete excision.7 Our patient underwent full excision of his verrucous lymphatic malformation without complications or recurrence at the 12-month follow-up.",Pediatrics,"An 8-year-old otherwise healthy boy presented with a yellow-orange, rough nodule on his medial right thigh (Figure 1).

The rash was asymptomatic and started as red bumps that then evolved into pustules and blisters. On further questioning, it was discovered that the patient’s father worked in a nursing home that had experienced a recent outbreak of scabies. Shortly after the onset of the outbreak, the patient and all family members were treated with 2 once-weekly doses of permethrin, 5%, cream. All other family members had significant improvement with the treatment; however, our patient’s lesions continued to worsen during the subsequent 2 weeks. On physical examination, the patient had numerous erythematous macules, papules, and pustules on her back. Many of the lesions had superimposed hemorrhagic crust and surrounding scale. In addition, several grouped papules were noted, including some in a linear array (Figure 1A and B). The rest of her cutaneous examination results were unremarkable except for a few fading pink papules noted on her left abdomen (Figure 1C).Numerous erythematous papules and pustules on the back, many with overlying hemorrhagic crust and surrounding scale (A) and (B), and few erythematous papules on the left lower abdomen (C). What Is Your Diagnosis?",Langerhans cell histiocytosis,Contact dermatitis,Scabies,Postscabetic acropustulosis,C. Scabies,C,Scabies,"Several lesions were scraped using a number 15 blade with a drop of potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution placed on the slide. Initial microscopic examination revealed motion within the thick scale (Figure 2A). Because the lesions had significant overlying crust and scale, additional KOH was used to dissolve this debris. Scabies mites and numerous scabetic eggs, which had previously been obscured by the debris, became visible (Figure 2B-D).Initial microscopic view (A), and microscopic view of scabies mites and eggs visible almost immediately after potassium hydroxide application (B) and 15 minutes after potassium hydroxide application (C and D) (original magnification ×10).Sarcoptes scabei var hominis is an 8-legged mite that can burrow into the skin within 30 minutes of initial contact.1 Following a 4- to 6-week incubation period, patients can note an intense pruritus caused by a type 4 hypersensitivity reaction to the mite.2 Transmission generally occurs through direct person to person contact; however, mites can also be transferred from fomites such as clothing and bedsheets. Potential complications include bacterial superinfection and postscabetic pruritus, the latter of which can persist for a month after treatment and can be recurrent.3 In children, scabies commonly presents as pruritic red papules primarily affecting the palms, soles, intertriginous regions, face, and scalp.2 Superficial burrows appear as serpiginous or linear slightly raised lesions. Isolated involvement of the back is atypical. On dermoscopic examination, a V-shaped contrail sign may be seen, representing the mite and its prior path. When performing a scraping, it is best to target a burrow as this will provide the highest positive yield. In addition to the scabies mite, eggs and scybala (fecal pellets) can also be directly visualized using microscopy. Scrapings can be prepared with either mineral oil or KOH; however, KOH exposure kills the mites and will dissolve the scybala over time, whereas mineral oil will not.4 As a result, mineral oil is preferred by most physicians, but KOH may be beneficial when thick scale interferes with optimal visualization. First-line treatment of scabies is permethrin, 5%, cream,3 with a repeated treatment in 1 week to eradicate newly hatched mites. Permethrin must be applied over the entire body with skin contact for at least 8 hours.5 Precipitated sulfur, 2% to 8%, is an alternative therapy for infants, pregnant women, and lactating women.4 Resistance to permethrin is uncommon and treatment failure is usually due to inadequate application of the medication rather than a true inadequate response.3In our case, the patient’s mother applied permethrin to the infant’s entire body, then immediately dressed the patient and placed her on her back to sleep. The cream may have rubbed off onto the patient’s clothing and sheets, leading to inadequate treatment of the back. Following appropriate counseling and treatment, the rash resolved.With pediatric scabies, the clinician must maintain a high index of suspicion, even in atypical presentations. Persistent scabies infection is likely due to suboptimal treatment, which is a common explanation for “refractory” infection. The clinician must review a detailed treatment plan with the family regarding how permethrin should be used. Finally, samples from scrapings must be processed appropriately. When significant thick scale is present, KOH may be preferred to mineral oil for superior visualization.",Pediatrics,"A 9-week-old girl had a rash on her back that had been present for 7 weeks. The rash was asymptomatic and started as red bumps that then evolved into pustules and blisters. On further questioning, it was discovered that the patient’s father worked in a nursing home that had experienced a recent outbreak of scabies. Shortly after the onset of the outbreak, the patient and all family members were treated with 2 once-weekly doses of permethrin, 5%, cream. All other family members had significant improvement with the treatment; however, our patient’s lesions continued to worsen during the subsequent 2 weeks. On physical examination, the patient had numerous erythematous macules, papules, and pustules on her back. Many of the lesions had superimposed hemorrhagic crust and surrounding scale. In addition, several grouped papules were noted, including some in a linear array (Figure 1A and B).

Minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa,D,Minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa,"The key clinical feature in this case is recognizing that this patient could have minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. Differential diagnosis includes erythema nodosum, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus or other connective tissue disease, rheumatic fever, Lyme disease, parvovirus, minocycline-induced systemic lupus erythematosus, minocycline-induced hepatitis, lymphoma, drug reaction, and other vasculitis. To establish a definitive diagnosis requires performing a skin biopsy.The antibiotic minocycline is a semisynthetic tetracycline derivative that is widely used. Recently, attention has been paid to the rarer systemic adverse effects of minocycline-induced autoimmune disorders such as drug-induced lupus erythematosus, serum sickness, autoimmune hepatitis, polyarthritis, and vasculitis. This is a case report of minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. All reported cases1-5 described symptoms of generalized myalgia, polyarthritis, livedo reticularis, or subcutaneous nodules and histologic confirmation of vasculitis that met the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for polyarteritis nodosa (at least 3 of 10 parameters).3Idiopathic cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a necrotizing vasculitis of small and medium-sized arteries within the skin, without involvement of the internal organs. Culver et al1 proposed diagnostic guidelines for minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. Patients should fulfill 6 of the following 7 criteria: (1) minocycline use for more than 12 months; (2) skin manifestations, including livedo reticularis and/or subcutaneous nodules; (3) arthritis and/or myalgia and/or neuropathy in the distribution of the rash; (4) lack of systemic organ involvement; (5) skin biopsy sample showing necrotizing vasculitis of small and/or medium-sized vessels; (6) evidence of perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies; and (7) improvement after discontinuation of minocycline.1Polyarteritis nodosa is usually self-limited, once minocycline is discontinued. In several cases,2,3 the syndrome will reoccur if rechallenged with minocycline. Previous case reports and case series1,3-5 have shown initial symptomatic improvement with short courses of prednisone. It is contraindicated to restart minocycline after this adverse effect has occurred.For this patient, the results of a further workup for systemic lupus erythematosus, including anti–Sjögren syndrome antigen A, anti–Sjögren syndrome antigen B, antiribonucleoprotein, anti-Sm, and anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies, were negative. A histologic examination of the skin biopsy sample of the lesion over the right anterior tibia revealed inflammation of medium-sized vessels in the subcutis with minimal associated panniculitis (Figure 2). Neutrophils and fibrin are present in the vessel wall. A biopsy of the skin over the left anterior tibia revealed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes and histiocytes in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue; the epidermis was unremarkable. The infiltrate is predominantly perivascular, although no distinct damage and no small vessels were noted. These findings were diagnostic of polyarteritis nodosa. Sarcoidosis is unlikely with a normal chest radiograph and with no histological evidence of granulomas.Medium-sized vessel with neutrophilic vasculitis (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×100).Initially, the patient was treated with intermittent short courses of prednisone for symptom control. Minocycline therapy was discontinued. She had complete resolution of her symptoms, and her laboratory test results returned to normal. She continues to be asymptomatic 18 months after cessation of minocycline. Physicians should be aware of this serious but reversible adverse effect of this commonly used antibiotic.

Tinea incognito.,D,Tinea incognito,"This patient had a complex course most notable for the absence of a definitive diagnosis. One therapeutic trial after another was attempted until the clinician’s therapeutic armamentarium was exhausted. In patients with scaling rashes, a simple, reproducible, inexpensive test, the potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, can immediately confirm the diagnosis of tinea and guide treatment. In this case, KOH test results of the patchy rash demonstrated hyphae (Figure 2), confirming the diagnosis of tinea faciei.Clorazol black E potassium hydroxide preparation showing black, branching septate hyphae (arrowheads) (original magnification ×100).A more detailed history revealed that a dog lived in the house and no siblings or friends were known to have tinea. Zoophilic dermatophytes like Microsporum canis produce more inflammatory rashes than anthropophilic fungi such as Trichophyton rubrum. Treatment was initiated with terbinifine 250 mg, ½ tablet orally daily, and ketoconazole, 2%, cream twice daily. The rash cleared completely within 4 weeks.Once a definitive diagnosis was made, the patient’s lack of response to treatment was less of a mystery. Desonide, 0.05%, ointment is a topical steroid of mild to moderate potency. Its vasoconstrictive effects can decrease redness and its antipruritic effects can decrease itching, but it will not kill the dermatophyte fungus that was the root of this problem. The anti-inflammatory effects do change the appearance of tinea, often eliminating classic features of ringworm and producing an appearance sometimes termed tinea incognito.Although the Food and Drug Administration package insert for griseofulvin recommends a dose of 10 mg/kg, often 20 mg/kg is required to clear tinea.1 A dose of 12.5 mL taken with milk to increase absorption for at least 4 weeks could have been more effective. The topical antifungals may well have cleared superficial scaling caused by the tinea but left behind inflammatory papules caused by dermatophyte fungus within hair follicles producing an acneiform eruption (Majocchi granulomata). Antibacterial antibiotics have no effect on dermatophytes. Once a definitive diagnosis was made, treatment with oral terbinifine and topical antifungal cream for 1 month cleared the condition.Studies have demonstrated that performing KOH examinations can significantly decrease errors in diagnosis and treatment.2-4 A review of 7 double-blinded diagnostic tests found KOH examinations to be highly sensitive (94.3%) and the most cost-effective means of confirming fungal infections.2 In another study, treatment plans were altered in 25% of cases following a KOH preparation and the proportion of correct therapeutic decisions increased from 54% to 69%.3 When it is impractical to perform a KOH preparation, a fungal culture can be obtained by “scraping” scale into a sterile container and sending this to the laboratory, but a result may not be available for 4 weeks.",Pediatrics,"A 4-year-old, 15-kg girl presented with a 3-month history of a pruritic rash bilaterally on the cheeks, initially thought to be related to mosquito bites.

Ecthyma gangrenosum,B,Ecthyma gangrenosum,"A pediatric infectious diseases specialist gave a clinical diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum and probable immunodeficiency. Antibiotics were changed to piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium to cover Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the HIV type 1 viral load was determined. Skin biopsy revealed a necrotizing vasculitis with hemorrhage and surrounding edema, suggestive of ecthyma gangrenosum. Blood cultures and skin biopsy showed P aeruginosa. Skin lesions improved with antipseudomonal antibiotic therapy. The HIV type 1 viral load was higher than 7.0 log10 copies/mL. The CD4+ cell count (4770/μL [to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001]) and immunoglobulin levels (IgG, 735 mg/dL; IgA, 37 mg/dL; and IgM, 55 mg/dL [to convert IgG to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01; to convert IgA and IgM to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10]) were normal. Fourth-generation ELISA for HIV was performed (the first assay was first generation) using the blood sample collected from the mother before delivery, and the result was positive. Six weeks after beginning highly active antiretroviral therapy, the viral load was reduced to 2403 copies/mL (3.38 log10 copies/mL), the CD4+ cell count was 1191/μL, and the neutrophil count increased to 2810/μL.Ecthyma gangrenosum is a rare cutaneous manifestation most often associated with a P aeruginosa bacteremia or septicemia. It occurs in up to 6% of patients with systemic P aeruginosa infection,1 but it also occurs as a primary cutaneous infection by inoculation. Clinically similar lesions may develop as a result of infection with other agents such as Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Burkholderia cepacia, Klebsiella species, Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Proteus species, Aeromonas hydrophila, Sternotrophomonas maltophilia, Aspergillus species, and Candida species.1,2Most commonly seen in patients who are critically ill and immunocompromised, occasional cases of ecthyma gangrenosum have been reported in otherwise healthy children.3-5 Patients at high risk include those with any kind of immunodeficiency associated with neutropenia (chemotherapy, primary causes, or neutrophil functional defects), hypogammaglobulinemia, malignant neoplasms, or severe burns.2,6 It is necessary to determine whether neutropenia is secondary to the infection, a persistent condition, or a transient phenomenon (eg, viral induced) in previously healthy children.2 Considering this diagnosis, a thorough search for any underlying immune deficiency should be undertaken. It is mandatory to exclude HIV infection, as it is more frequent than any primary immunodeficiency.The characteristic clinical appearance is a red, painless macule that enlarges to become an elevated papule; this evolves in 12 to 18 hours into hemorrhagic pustules or infarcted-appearing areas surrounded by an erythematous halo.7 These lesions result from perivascular bacterial invasion of media and adventitia of vessels into dermis and subcutaneous tissues, with secondary thrombosis, giving rise to necrotizing vasculitis (due to protease and endotoxin A produced by P aeruginosa). There is bacterial invasion of the adventitia and media of dermal veins but not arteries.1 The main sites affected include the apocrine areas (gluteal or perineal region [55%]), but these lesions can spread to other sites (limbs [30%] and face and trunk [12%]).8 The absence of suppuration and slough distinguishes it from pyoderma gangrenosum as well as external inoculation with group A Streptococci, which produces a crusted ulcerated plaque.9This is a severe infection associated with a high mortality rate, requiring prompt diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is established, early treatment must include antibiotic coverage against P aeruginosa. If lesions fail to respond to antimicrobials, surgical debridement should be performed. Multiple lesions, delay in treatment, and neutropenia are poor prognostic indicators.9For routine HIV screening during pregnancy, fourth-generation ELISA should be preferred, especially in high-risk groups.10 Fourth-generation assays test for both antibodies and antigens simultaneously, being better able to detect recent infection than first-generation tests that detect only antibodies.

Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn,C,Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn,"A shave removal of the entire lesion was performed followed by electrodessication. The biopsy was consistent with nevus sebaceous (NS) of Jadassohn. The light-brown coloration of the patient’s NS, which is classically described as yellow orange, was a variant of normal secondary to his basal pigmentation.Nevus sebaceous is a congenital hamartoma, occurring in 0.3% of neonates.1 Histologically, NS is defined by epidermal hyperplasia with direct opening of sebaceous and apocrine glands to the epidermis.2 Most are present at birth.1 The lesion’s natural history comprises 3 growth stages. During infancy, NS is a round, oval, or linear smooth, yellow-orange alopecic plaque on the head, face, neck, or scalp.1,3 During puberty, hormonally mediated sebaceous gland growth results in a larger, verrucous-appearing lesion that may become pruritic and friable.1-3 Some undergo a third stage with development of a benign or malignant neoplasm focally within the NS.3 This final phase is often postpubertal and most common in adults older than 40, but neoplasms have been reported in children.1,4Clinical concerns for NS cases include potential intralesional benign and malignant tumors and the propensity to become pruritic, painful, or unsightly. Two small case series showed that ablative lasers are effective and safe for removing NS when cosmesis is the primary concern.5,6 Surgical excision is the definitive treatment for NS, but there is no consensus on treatment recommendations owing to the uncertain risk for malignant transformation.Neoplasms identified within NS include trichoblastoma, syringocystadenoma papilliferum, sebaceous epithelioma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), trichilemmoma, adnexal carcinoma, and eccrine poroma.3 A literature review including 4923 NS cases found that benign and malignant tumors developed in 16% (range, 0%-51%) and 8% (range, 0%-22%) of cases, respectively.3 The most common benign neoplasms arising in NS are trichoblastoma and syringocystadenoma papilliferum.4,7 Earlier studies reported a higher incidence of malignancy, most commonly BCC, than recent studies. In studies from 1960 to 1990, malignant neoplasms were reported in 9% to 21% of NS; in studies from 1990 to the present, 0% to 1% contained malignant neoplasms.2,3,7,8 This inconsistency is reportedly owing to previous misdiagnoses of trichoblastoma as BCC and interstudy differences in average patient age. Retrospective histopathologic analysis of NS cases suggest that many trichoblastomas had been misdiagnosed as BCC, while they actually had features consistent with benign trichogenic tumors on review.4,7 Decreased average patient age in recent studies may also be significant because lower rates of BCC occur in younger patients.9Despite research on the malignant potential of NS, the lifetime risk for BCC in NS is uncertain because studies determined the incidence of BCC in NS that were usually removed in childhood. Early, prophylactic excision removes lesions before malignant transformation; study of these lesions does not assess malignant potential.2,9,10 Given this uncertainty, there is controversy over whether prophylactic excision owing to malignant potential is necessary.Those who recommend prophylactic excision emphasize the rare, but documented, occurrence of malignancy in NS during childhood. They suggest this is reason to view NS as a premalignant lesion and necessitate early removal.2,3,11 Prophylactic excision is a smaller procedure than surgical removal of a malignant lesion. Additional justifications for early excision include cosmetic concerns, greater ease of excision prior to expansion phase, and risk of loss to follow-up.1,3,10 Conversely, with decreased reported incidence of BCC, some authors question the benefit of prophylactic excision and support surveillance of lesions for clinical changes with the possibility of excision at a later time.4,7 These authors view NS as a benign lesion that only rarely undergoes malignant transformation and believe that excision can be delayed.12Given the lack of consensus on treatment, determination of whether and when to excise should be made on an individual basis in a collaboration among the doctor, patient, and parents, taking into consideration factors including the patient’s age, location and size of the lesion, certainty of diagnosis, malignant potential, aesthetic concerns, ease of surgery, need for anesthesia, and ability for close follow-up if observation is chosen.",Pediatrics,"A 15-year-old male presented to the dermatology clinic with a lesion that had been present on his right nasal sidewall since birth.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Supernumerary nostril,Nasal encephalocele,Proboscis lateralis,Cerebro-oculo-nasal syndrome,C. Proboscis lateralis,C,Proboscis lateralis,"The diagnosis is proboscis lateralis, a multistructural defect that is often associated with heminasal hypoplasia or aplasia,1 but rarely with choanal atresia or palatal defects.2 Patients often have an abnormally developed lacrimal system on the affected side, orbital asymmetry, a laterally displaced lateral canthus, choanal atresia, craniofacial clefts, absence or hypoplasia of hemifacial bones, cleft lip, cleft palate, agenesis of the olfactory nerve, and encephlocele.3,4 The proboscis contains a narrow lumen that ends blindly at the level of the dura mater or skull base. All tissues normally found in a nose may be present in the proboscis.4 In this case, simple excision of the trunk was performed. The wound was closed primarily in 2 layers with 4-0 polyglactin 910 and 5-0 synthetic, nonabsorbable nylon sutures. Stitches were removed on the seventh postoperative day. The postoperative period was uneventful, with excellent cosmetic appearance.Khoo1 classified proboscis lateralis into 4 groups according to its accompanying abnormalities. Group I is the least common and consists of a normal nose with proboscis lateralis. In group II, nasal abnormalities accompany the proboscis on the same side. Group III is the most common type, in which eye and/or adnexal defects occur in addition to the ipsilateral nasal defects and proboscis. In group IV, in addition to the nasal and ocular defects, there is a cleft lip and/or palate.Sakamoto et al5 proposed revised classification and added 2 new groups: group V, defined as hypertelorism with encephalocele, and group VI, patients with hypotelorism. They systematically summarized the complex abnormalities of facial development involving nasal prominences and maxillary prominence leading to different deformities. This new classification scheme is said to be embryologically more accurate and correlates with clinical presentation and management.5The recommended evaluation for an infant with proboscis lateralis includes complete clinical examination, conventional frontal and lateral cephalometric images, orthopantogram, CT scan (axial as well as coronal cuts with 3-dimensional reconstruction provide excellent bony details), MRI (for soft tissue findings), and rhinoscopy if possible for all cranial and facial malformations. An ophthalmologic examination should be done in all cases because ocular anomalies such as microphthalmia, coloboma of the eye, and lacrimal system anomalies may be found with proboscis lateralis.3,6,7To evaluate the intrinsic structure of the proboscis and associated anomalies and planning for surgery, CT and MRI both should be undertaken.4 Computed tomography demonstrates details of bony anatomy. It also helps to differentiate the ossified parts of the skull base from dura or fibrous tissue, all of which appear as low signal on MRI. Details of the nasal cavity and the relationship of the proboscis with the orbit can be shown by CT. Similarly, MRI also reveals the relationship between the proboscis and orbit. Possible associated cerebral anomalies can be excluded.4Management is surgical. Because of the high degree of variability of associated anomalies, an individualized approach is required. Khoo group I proboscis lateralis is very rare, in which simple excision of the trunk may be sufficient.7,8 However, in most cases, the reconstruction is complex and requires an otolaryngologist and ophthalmologist in addition to the reconstructive surgeon.3 Reconstruction of the proboscis should begin as soon as the surgeon feels comfortable handling the small tissues, to minimize psychological trauma for the child and the parents. Surgical corrections usually start in the first year of life. The trunk is itself an ideal donor graft because it provides an excellent color and texture match and is lined by nasal mucosa.1,3,7,8Associated choanal atresia and lacrimal system anomalies should be dealt with. However, restenosis and distortion of the dacryocystorhinostomy may occur. This will often require a repeated dacryocystorhinostomy and long-term cannulation for lacrimal duct patency.3 Secondary procedures such as grafting can be delayed until late adolescence. Selection of the surgical technique to reconstruct the proboscis should be based on the anatomical characteristics of the proboscis, its localization, and the parents’ expectations.7,8",Pediatrics,"A 10-day-old, full-term girl presented with a trunklike projection from the medial canthus of the left eye (Figure).

She had been treated with topical mupirocin and oral amoxicillin–clavulanate potassium for a suspected superficial skin infection. She presented for evaluation because new lesions of similar appearance appeared on the upper limbs, trunk, vulva, and perineum despite antibiotic therapy.

Also the vulva and perineum had an intense erythematous rash. She was apyretic and vital parameters were normal. Laboratory tests showed a normal white blood cell count and lymphocyte subpopulations, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level.

Linear IgA dermatosis,C,Linear IgA dermatosis,"A skin biopsy was performed; direct immunofluorescence showed linear deposition of IgA and (less expressed) IgM along the basement membrane zone with no C3 and IgG. Histologic analysis showed inflammation with neutrophil infiltrate. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of linear IgA bullous dermatitis. She received a combination of prednisone and dapsone, with complete healing of wounds in 3 weeks.Linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood, also known as chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood, is a rare, chronic, acquired autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease.1 It was first described as a different entity from dermatitis herpetiformis or bullous pemphigoid by Chorzelski et al2 in 1979, based on the immunopathologic finding of linear IgA deposits in the basement membrane zone on direct immunofluorescence. In fact, neutrophilic abscesses may be noted in the dermal papillary tips, indistinguishable from those of dermatitis herpetiformis, which is the skin presentation of celiac disease. For this reason, in these clinical settings, it is important to search for the presence of anti-transglutaminase and antiendomysial antibodies. Therefore, direct immunofluorescence studies are required for a definitive diagnosis of linear IgA bullous dermatosis; perilesional skin demonstrates linear deposition of IgA and sometimes IgG and C3 at the dermal-epidermal junction. Immunoelectron microscopy has localized the immunoreactants to the sublamina densa, although a combined sublamina densa and lamina lucida pattern has also been seen.Linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood has a bimodal age at onset because it may have its onset in children and adults. Disease in children begins usually at preschool age, with a mean of 4 to 5 years.3Classic sites of linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood are the trunk and iliosacral region; further regions such as the legs, face, or large body folds can also be affected. Typically, pearl necklace–like, grouped, centrifugally arranged tense blisters, erythema, and urticarial plaques are present and severe pruritus exists. Especially in children, a “jewel-like” distribution of blisters exists (“cluster of jewels”). In 50% of cases, there is mucosal involvement, especially of the oral mucous membranes.The differential diagnosis of linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood includes bullous impetigo, dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid, and scabies. Pediatricians frequently misdiagnose linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood as impetigo.4 Immunofluorescence studies are very important for the diagnosis of linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood because they show a predominant linear band of IgA at the epidermal basement membrane.5 The primary therapy in linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood remains dapsone and the most common adverse effects are hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase–deficient patients and methemoglobinemia. Dapsone is begun at 1 to 2 mg/kg/d increasing at weekly intervals until symptoms are adequately controlled.4 Some patients may require a low dose of prednisone initially to suppress blister formation or when there is mucosal involvement. It is usually a benign and self-limiting disorder; a long-standing remission can be achieved either with dapsone or a combination therapy. Sulfapyridine, colchicines, erythromycin, oxacillin sodium, and dicloxacillin have also been tried with variable results.1,5Linear IgA dermatosis can be also drug induced but this condition is more likely to occur in the older population and is rarely described in children. Drugs that have been associated with linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood include antibiotics (vancomycin hydrochloride is the best-documented agent in the literature) and nonsteroidal inflammatory agents.6-8 For drug-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis, withdrawal of the medication is followed by a quick healing of the lesions. Dapsone is quickly efficient in idiopathic linear IgA bullous dermatosis.",Pediatrics,"A 5-year-old girl presented with a 2-week history of pruritic, bullous skin lesions that had started on her lower limbs.

Virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa,C,Virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa,"Microscopy analysis showed abnormal maturation of anagen hair follicles with excessive inner root sheath differentiation and hyperkeratotic infundibula. The hair bulb was rounded (instead of the normal horseshoe shape) and the mature hair shaft was replaced by a column of eosinophilic nucleated cells containing prominent trichohyalin granules. Large intranuclear inclusion bodies were also noted. The upper portion of the hair follicles was dilated and filled with compact keratin. These features were diagnostic of virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa. Complete resolution of the skin lesions occurred over a few weeks after discontinuation of the chemotherapy regimen.Virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa is a recently described distinctive cutaneous eruption associated with immunosuppression and caused by a member of the polyomavirus family, designated as trichodysplasia spinulosa–associated polyomavirus (TSPyV).1-5 Although initially described in patients who had undergone organ transplant (mainly renal) and were receiving cyclosporine to maintain the immunosuppressive state, trichodysplasia spinulosa, in more recent reports, occurred in patients who had other causes of immunosuppression such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.1-6 The age of affected individuals ranges between 5 and 70 years, with slight male predominance.Clinically, this condition usually manifests as a distinctive asymptomatic or mildly pruritic, 2- to 5-mm, spiny, hyperkeratotic follicular papular eruption predominantly over the central face.1-6 Progression to involve the trunk and extremities and the development of alopecia of the eyebrows and/or eyelashes can also occur. The histological features are usually peculiar and characterized by an abnormal maturation of the anagen hair follicles with excessive inner root sheath differentiation. In cases of doubt, immunohistochemical staining for the polyomavirus middle T antigen can be used to demonstrate positive staining of cellular inclusions within keratinocytes that compose the inner root sheath.6 However, negative immunohistochemical staining does not rule out the diagnosis, and in such cases, polymerase chain reaction or electron microscopy may be used.The pathogenesis of the condition has only recently been identified as a member of the polyomavirus family and designated as TSPyV. Initially, intranuclear viral particles most suggestive morphologically of a polyomavirus were identified using electron microscopy.2-4 Identification of TSPyV was later confirmed by isolating the genomic material from plucked spines and determining the viral sequences through rolling circle amplification, a cloning technique developed to optimize amplification of circular DNA.5 Other molecular techniques were later used for virus identification including polymerase chain reaction with virus-specific primers and by direct sequencing.3,4,6 In addition to TSPyV, the human polyomavirus family includes BK virus, JC virus, KI virus, WU virus, and Merkel cell polyomavirus.3 In general, these viruses contain a supercoiled double-stranded DNA genome within a small nonenveloped icosahedral virion and are characterized by a restricted host range where they are only able to infect and cause disease in humans.3Differential diagnosis of the follicular keratoses observed in virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa includes several entities such as keratosis pilaris, lichen spinulosus, follicular drug eruptions, multiple filiform verrucae, phrynoderma, and follicular deposition of paraproteins in patients with multiple myeloma. These can be excluded with appropriate clinical context and when required, histopathologic evaluation.Complete resolution of the lesions usually occurs after restoration of normal immune function.3 Antiviral agents have also provided a good therapeutic option in case immune function cannot be restored. Mild to moderate benefit occurred in patients treated with cidofovir cream, 1% or 3%, applied once or twice a day. As reported in 2 solid organ transplant patients, oral valganciclovir hydrochloride administration may even lead to greater improvement.3 However, close monitoring for bone marrow suppression and potential drug interactions is important when using systemic antiviral therapy. Other treatments such as antibacterials, steroids, imiquimod, and retinoids are usually not effective.",Pediatrics,"A 5-year-old boy, known to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia since the age of 3 years, presented with a 3-week history of asymptomatic skin lesions primarily affecting the face and to a lesser extent the trunk and extremities (Figure, A and B).

Rickettsialpox,D,Rickettsialpox,"Histologic examination of a papule showed focal epidermal erosion and a relatively dense and diffuse perivascular and interstitial dermal infiltrate of predominantly mononuclear cells and a few neutrophils, with changes indicative of a mild vasculitis. When taken together with the clinical findings, the histologic features were most consistent with a diagnosis of rickettsialpox. The skin biopsy specimen was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which later confirmed the presence of spotted-fever group rickettsia by immunohistochemistry. The patient clinically improved after 3 days of supportive care, and he was discharged with outpatient follow-up.Rickettsialpox was first described in 1946 in residents of an apartment complex in Queens, New York.1 It is a zoonotic infection caused by Rickettsia akari, which belongs to the spotted-fever group of rickettsioses. It is an obligate intracellular gram-negative coccobacillus that is transmitted by the bite of an infected house mouse mite, Liponyssoides sanguineus,2 whose reservoir is the common house mouse, Mus musculus.3 Rickettsialpox is an urban disease that occurs where rodents live in close proximity with human beings. It is endemic to certain parts of the Northeastern United States, such as New York City, but is increasingly being recognized as a global disease.4Rickettsialpox has previously been described in children,5,6 although little information is available regarding its presentation in infants younger than 1 year. This disease classically consists of a triad of fever, a primary eschar, and a papulovesicular eruption. The initial lesion develops at the bite site within 24 to 48 hours and is a painless papulovesicle, which ruptures and produces an eschar that is apparent in 95% of cases.4 Constitutional symptoms generally appear within 9 to14 days following inoculation and include fever, malaise, myalgias, and headache. Two to 3 days later, sparse maculopapules and papulovesicles can present on the torso, face, and extremities and typically number between 20 and 40.4,7 The most consistent associated laboratory finding is a mild leukopenia.4,7The differential diagnosis for our patient initially included rickettsialpox, primary varicella, bacterial pustulosis, herpes simplex, or other viral exanthem. Varicella closely mimics rickettsialpox and is a leading alternative diagnosis in unvaccinated children. However, several features allow these 2 entities to be distinguished. Rickettsialpox typically presents with fewer lesions, which are often more papular than the vesicles seen in varicella. Rickettsialpox is less pruritic and the lesions are monomorphic and do not appear in successive crops. While this patient lacked a primary eschar, his sparse papular eruption raised the possibility of rickettsialpox. Furthermore, on additional questioning, the family admitted to the presence of mice in their home, accounting for the primary reservoir of this disease.After its discovery in 1946, more than 800 cases of rickettsialpox have been described in the literature, although almost half of these were reported within 3 years of the initial outbreak. Reports have diminished drastically, likely reflecting the fact that the diagnosis is going unrecognized and unreported in many instances. Pediatric cases may prove particularly challenging because constitutional symptoms cannot always be reported in this age group. Additionally, the diagnosis can easily be mistaken for a mild case of varicella in unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children. This case illustrates the persistence of rickettsialpox as a modern disease entity and serves as a reminder that this diagnosis should be considered in children who present with fever, irritability, and a papulovesicular rash.",Pediatrics,"A previously well 7-month-old male infant presented to our emergency department with 1 week of loose stools, 4 days of fever up to 39.2°C, and 2 days of skin rash.
