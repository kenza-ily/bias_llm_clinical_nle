1007,346,347,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2781466,62021,"A 13-year-old boy with an unsteady gait was referred for evaluation. He had been well until 1 month prior, when he developed lower limb weakness after eating a vegetarian diet for 15 days. His medical and family histories were unremarkable. His walking had become unsteady, and he was less talkative. On examination, he scored 24 on a Mini-Mental State Examination, with impairments in temporal and spatial orientation, calculation, and short-term memory. Horizontal nystagmus was observed. His lower limb strength was 4 of 5 proximally and 5− of 5 distally, with increased muscle tone. Patellar reflexes were brisk. Ankle clonus and Babinski signs were present bilaterally.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Hereditary spastic paraplegia,Cobalamin C deficiency,Cystathionine β-synthase deficiency,Cobalamin G or methionine synthase deficiency,B. Cobalamin C deficiency,B,Cobalamin C deficiency,"This teenager presented with subacute-onset spastic gait and homocysteine elevation. Homocysteinemia can be acquired or inherited with or without methylmalonic acidemia. His age, normal vitamin and folate levels, and lack of intrinsic factor antibodies suggested an inherited metabolic disorder. Elevation of methylmalonic acid (MMA) narrowed the differential diagnosis.Methylmalonic acidemia with homocysteinemia is caused by defects in the absorption, transportation, and metabolism of cobalamin.1 Normally, after entering the cell, cobalamin is reduced to cobalamin II through functions of cobalamin F, J, C, and D. Next, cobalamin II is converted to methyl-cobalamin, remethylating homocysteine to methionine. Alternatively, cobalamin II can be converted to adenosyl-cobalamin, a cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Blocking this step results in accumulation of L-methylmalonyl-CoA metabolites, which include MMA and methyl citrate acid. Therefore, any defect affecting conversion of cobalamin to cobalamin II will cause simultaneous elevations in homocysteine and MMA, leading to neuronal and endothelial dysfunctions. A cobalamin C (CblC) deficiency (choice B) is most likely. Hereditary spastic paraplegia (choice A) can present with spastic gait, encephalopathy, and seizure but cannot explain the abnormal biochemical results. Cystathionine β-synthase and methionine synthase catalyze conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine and methionine, respectively. Although defects in cystathionine β-synthase (choice C) or cobalamin G or methionine synthase (choice D) can cause homocysteinemia, neither leads to elevated MMA because adenosylcobalamin is unaffected.Whole-exome genetic sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variations (exon 4: p.Arg161Gln; p.Trp203Ter) in the patient’s MMACHC gene, confirming late-onset CblC deficiency. Folate, methyl-cobalamin, and levocarnitine were prescribed. One month later, the homocysteine level was 4.08 mg/L and his gait had slightly improved. The slow recovery may have been because of delayed diagnosis.Deficiency in CblC is autosomal recessive. It is the most common intracellular cobalaminopathy, with an incidence estimated at 1 per 3920 individuals in Shandong province, China; 1 per 60 000 in California; and 1 per 37 000 in the US Hispanic population.2,3 Early-onset forms typically manifest as poor feeding, lethargy, developmental delay, and microcephaly in the neonatal period. Late-onset forms present in adolescence or adulthood and are often triggered by dehydration, vegan diet, infection, or pregnancy. Clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and include encephalopathy, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, dystonia, ataxia, gait abnormality, thromboembolic events, cytopenia, chronic kidney disease, and optic nerve atrophy. Severity varies from no symptoms to multisystemic involvement.4 Neuroradiological features are nonspecific and may include cerebral atrophy, edema, leukoencephalopathy, infarction, corpus callosum thinning, and abnormal signals in the basal ganglia region. Spinal cord imaging features may mimic subacute combined degeneration, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, and syringomyelia.5 Biochemical abnormalities provide important diagnostic clues. Organic acid profiling is characterized by elevations in MMA and methyl citrate acid. Since carnitine binds acyl residues to aid the excretion of propionyl-CoA, patients may show increases in propionyl carnitine levels (>5 μmol/L) and propionyl carnitine–acetyl carnitine ratio (>0.25) (Figure 2).6 Confirmatory diagnosis requires gene sequencing. Treatment is aimed at decreasing MMA levels, promoting homocysteine-to-methionine conversion, and accelerating acyl carnitine clearance. Long-term use of parenteral hydroxocobalamin, methyl-cobalamin, or betaine; folate; and L-carnitine is warranted.4 Available treatments may be region-specific, and a metabolic physician should be consulted. Protein restriction is not recommended. Urine MMA and serum homocysteine levels should be monitored. Diagnosing a late-onset CblC deficiency is challenging because of its rarity and heterogeneity. This case highlights the value of screening for methylmalonic acidemia when facing spastic gait of unknown cause and importance of early treatment to avoid irreversible neurological complications.Serum amino acid and acyl carnitine analysis using the tandem mass spectrometry method showed increased propionyl carnitine levels (7.6 μmol/L) and propionyl carnitine/acetyl carnitine ratio (0.65) in the patient sample (A) vs a normal control (B). cps indicates counts per second.",Neurology,2021-06-01,2021,6,"A 13-year-old Arab child with an unsteady gait was referred for evaluation.

[Explanation]
The diagnosis of methylmalonic acidemia is based on several key findings in this clinical case:

1. Elevated urine methylmalonic acid: The urine organic acid analysis revealed increased methylmalonic acid levels, which is the hallmark of methylmalonic acidemia.

2. Neurological symptoms: The patient presented with an unsteady gait, lower limb weakness, cognitive impairments, and spasticity, which are consistent with the neurological manifestations of methylmalonic acidemia.

3. Elevated homocysteine: The patient had an increased homocysteine level (8.85 mg/L; reference, <2.03 mg/L), which is often seen in methylmalonic acidemia due to the interconnected metabolic pathways.

4. MRI findings: The hyperintense T2-weighted signal in the cervical spinal cord is consistent with the neurological involvement seen in methylmalonic acidemia.

5. Onset after dietary change: The symptoms appeared after the patient adopted a vegetarian diet for 15 days, which could have exacerbated an underlying metabolic disorder by potentially reducing the intake of vitamin B12, a crucial cofactor in the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase enzyme pathway.

6. Normal B12 levels: Despite the normal B12 levels, methylmalonic acidemia can occur due to genetic defects in the enzymes involved in B12 metabolism or the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase enzyme itself.

7. EEG findings: The diffuse background slowing with scattered epileptiform discharges is consistent with the metabolic encephalopathy often seen in methylmalonic acidemia.

These findings, particularly the elevated urine methylmalonic acid levels, strongly support the diagnosis of methylmalonic acidemia, a rare inherited metabolic disorder affecting the breakdown of certain amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids, and cholesterol.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Acquired epithelial lesions include squamous cell carcinoma and papilloma. Subepithelial lesions range from benign causes, such as lacrimal gland duct cysts and myxomas, to infiltrative conditions, such as metastatic carcinoma. Pigmented lesions typically consist of nevi or malignant melanoma, and inflammatory lesions can stem from conditions such as sarcoidosis.2When a patient presents with a conjunctival lesion, diagnostic imaging is important. Given the concern for an orbital mass in this case, orbital imaging was the initial step of evaluation. Findings of the computed tomographic scan that was performed were nonspecific, as was B-scan ultrasonography. Given the lack of diagnostic information from imaging, a conjunctival biopsy was performed to evaluate the lesion, which is important given the patient’s history of both thyroid and breast cancer.3 Although a systemic workup, including complete blood cell count and basic metabolic panel as well as serum and urine electrophoresis, are important in the evaluation for lymphoma or amyloidosis, the conjunctival biopsy was the next step given its ability to provide a more specific diagnosis.4,5 Histopathologic testing results revealed tumor cells with estrogen-receptor positive, progesterone-receptor positive, and ERBB2-negative, confirming the diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma (Figure 2). Topical corticosteroids are useful in inflammatory conditions, but would not be indicated in this patient.Histopathologic examination of a conjunctival lesion revealing tumor cells (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×400).The most common primary tumor to give rise to ocular metastasis in the female population is breast carcinoma.6 The incidence of ocular metastasis among patients with breast cancer is approximately 8% to 10%, typically occurring 2 to 5 years after initial diagnosis of the primary tumor.7 Metastatic lesions to the conjunctiva are uncommon and indicate poor prognosis.3 Symptoms include pain, chemosis, and foreign body sensation.3,6-9 In this case, the patient noticed ptosis, but was not aware of the conjunctival lesion as the lesion was not visible until the upper eyelid was everted.Most metastatic conjunctival lesions regress with external-beam radiotherapy, excisional biopsy, and/or chemotherapy.3,7 Because ocular disease presents when the systemic malignant lesion is advanced, the prognosis tends to be poor.2 The mean reported survival time after diagnosis of a conjunctival mass varies, ranging from 3 weeks to 26 months.3,6 Therefore, it is important to recognize conjunctival metastasis upon examination to provide timely and adequate therapeutic intervention.6,8 In addition, our case highlights the importance of obtaining a thorough history, because distant metastases can present many years after the initial diagnosis of nonocular malignant diseases.The patient underwent an excisional conjunctival biopsy on the same day as presentation, confirming the diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma. Further systemic evaluation revealed additional metastases to the cervical, lumbar, and thoracic spine; sacrum and bilateral iliac bones; adrenal glands; and lymph nodes.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and findings, performing an excisional biopsy of the conjunctival mass is the most appropriate next step. Here's why:

1. Suspicious mass: The patient presents with a solid, superior bulbar conjunctival mass measuring 10 mm in diameter, which is visible on external examination and confirmed by B-scan ultrasonography and CT scan.

2. Associated symptoms: The patient has ptosis and blurred vision in the right eye, which could be related to the mass.

3. Medical history: The patient has a history of thyroid cancer and breast cancer, which increases the risk of metastatic disease to the orbit.

4. Diagnostic necessity: To determine the nature of the mass (benign vs. malignant) and guide further treatment, a tissue diagnosis is essential.

5. Location: The conjunctival location of the mass makes it accessible for excisional biopsy, which can be both diagnostic and potentially therapeutic.

6. Exclusion of other options: The case doesn't mention other specific treatment options, and additional imaging or blood tests are unlikely to provide a definitive diagnosis without tissue sampling.

An excisional biopsy would provide the necessary tissue for histopathological examination, helping to determine the nature of the mass and guide further management. This is particularly important given the patient's age and history of malignancies, which raise suspicion for a possible metastatic lesion or primary ocular malignancy.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Types of acquired ptosis include aponeurotic ptosis involving slippage of the aponeurosis seen in elderly patients or after trauma, neurogenic ptosis from damage to the oculomotor or sympathetic nerves in the eyelid, myogenic ptosis from dysfunction of the levator muscle due to diseases such as myasthenia gravis, and mechanical ptosis from eyelid tumors or orbital fat prolapse.Unexplained ptosis in a young patient should alert the ophthalmologist because the cause of acquired ptosis will guide management. Aponeurotic ptosis with normal levator function is often corrected by conjunctival resection of the Müller muscle (choice C) provided there is adequate response of the eyelid to the phenylephrine test.1 Other options include the external levator advancement (choice D) or, in the case of poor levator function, the frontalis suspension. However, these choices are not preferred because this patient was young, and the cause was not confirmed to be aponeurotic ptosis. Other causes, such as myasthenia gravis, should be considered. Levator fatigability can be checked by prolonged upgaze for 1 to 2 minutes, followed by an ice pack test for ptosis correction with muscle cooling.2 Acetylcholine receptor antibody is specific, but caution should be exercised before commencing pyridostigmine bromide treatment (choice A), because this patient did not have systemic symptoms, extraocular muscle restriction, or fatigability. Horner syndrome should be excluded by confirming that no anisocoria is present that responds to apraclonidine or cocaine testing. Third nerve palsy should be excluded by confirming normal extraocular motility and pupils.This patient’s atypical presentation of ptosis warranted imaging. With computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (choice B), her ptosis was determined to be mechanical and secondary to compression of the superior rectus–levator muscle complex by a superior orbital rim tumor, likely an intraosseous hemangioma. These rare proliferations consist of endothelial-lined vascular channels.3-6 Intraosseous hemangiomas most often occur in the vertebral column, but case reports have reported occurrence in orbital bones.4,6,7 Intraosseous hemangiomas can cause mechanical ptosis, proptosis, diplopia, and vision loss.3,6,8 Radiographically, an appearance of an osteolytic sunburst pattern with superior resolution on MRI shows intralesional vascularity.3,7 The differential diagnosis can include fibrous dysplasia, chondroma, meningioma, osteoma, eosinophilic granuloma, and metastatic disease.3,4 Surgical resection is the definitive treatment for lesions causing secondary complications, although for smaller lesions, resection may not be needed.6Computed tomographic imaging and MRI of the orbit showed an enhancing osseous lesion at the superior orbital rim with extension into the superior orbit and mass effect on the superior rectus–levator muscle complex (Figure 2). A combined neurosurgery and oculoplastic procedure was performed, where the tumor was removed via a left-sided craniotomy and the defect was reconstructed with an orbital rim implant.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to check for myasthenia gravis and start a trial of pyridostigmine. This decision is supported by several key factors in the case:

1. Ptosis and diplopia: The patient presents with painless ptosis of the left upper eyelid and intermittent diplopia in all gazes. These are classic symptoms of myasthenia gravis, particularly when they are fluctuating or fatigable.

2. Age and demographics: The patient is a 35-year-old man, which falls within the typical age range for myasthenia gravis onset in men (20-40 years).

3. Absence of other neurological symptoms: The case doesn't mention any other neurological deficits, which is consistent with isolated ocular myasthenia.

4. Response to phenylephrine: The improvement in ptosis with phenylephrine suggests that the levator muscle is capable of functioning, which is consistent with a neuromuscular junction disorder like myasthenia gravis.

5. Normal pupillary responses: The absence of a relative afferent pupillary defect and the normal pupillary responses make other neurological causes less likely.

6. No history of trauma or other obvious causes: The absence of trauma or other clear etiologies for the symptoms further supports investigating for myasthenia gravis.

Checking myasthenia laboratory findings (such as acetylcholine receptor antibodies) and starting a trial of pyridostigmine (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) would be diagnostic and potentially therapeutic. If the patient responds to pyridostigmine, it would strongly support the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. This approach is less invasive and more targeted than immediately proceeding to imaging studies, given the clinical presentation that is highly suggestive of myasthenia gravis.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder associated with Sjögren syndrome,C,Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder associated with Sjögren syndrome,"The initial clinical suspicion for GCA was high given the patient’s classic presentation—a woman older than 65 years with sequential bilateral vision loss accompanied by scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, weight loss, and musculoskeletal pain suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica. Expedited evaluation and treatment are critical in suspected GCA. Initial laboratory workup should include ESR, CRP, and platelet count tests. Chan et al1 found that these 3 tests have similar sensitivity (range, 65%-71%) and specificity (range, 57%-62%) for GCA. The gold standard of GCA diagnosis is TAB, but the sensitivity is only 77%.2 Empirical treatment should not be delayed for TAB because the positivity rate is similar after up to 4 weeks of systemic corticosteroid therapy.3 In this clinically suspicious patient with ESR elevation but normal CRP level and platelet count and negative TAB results, GCA remained a plausible diagnosis to justify continued corticosteroid therapy.Vision loss secondary to arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is generally substantial and irreversible despite corticosteroid therapy,4 and treatment aims to reduce visual morbidity rather than restore vision. Accordingly, this patient underwent empirical treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy with the intent to preserve the remaining right eye vision.This patient’s improvement in vision was unexpected and challenged the working diagnosis of GCA (choice B). The patient also lacked the chalky optic nerve edema classically seen in GCA. On the contrary, this patient appeared to have a corticosteroid-responsive optic neuritis. A differential diagnosis might include demyelinating disease (eg, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease [MOGAD]) and inflammatory processes (eg, neurosarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome [SS]). Investigation for alternative diagnoses was pursued. The evidence of dry-eye disease on examination and incidental bilateral parotid gland cysts on neuroimaging suggested underlying SS. Of note, parotid cysts are not specific to SS and can also be seen in benign lymphoepithelial lesions (as occur in HIV infection), sarcoidosis, Warthin tumor, and obstructive sialadenitis.5 Serologic test results were positive for anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La, and anti–aquaporin 4 antibodies. The patient subsequently underwent cervical and thoracic spine magnetic resonance imaging, which showed contiguous signal abnormality in the spinal cord from T1 to T3 (Figure 2). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) associated with SS (choice C). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti–aquaporin 4 antibody (as used in this patient) has 97% specificity for NMOSD, and serum cell-based assays have up to 99% specificity.6 Bilateral non–arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (choice A) would be unlikely in this patient who lacked the disc-at-risk configuration—crowded small nerve head with small cup-disc ratio.7T2-weighted sagittal magnetic resonance image shows increased signal (arrowhead) from T1 to T3. No corresponding contrast enhancement was appreciated. These findings are compatible with a prior demyelinating lesion from neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder may occur in association with other autoimmune diseases. Co-occurrence with SS has been described, and in patients with this co-occurrence, onset of NMOSD may precede sicca symptoms.8 Other autoimmune disorders associated with NMOSD include systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, systemic sclerosis, and sarcoidosis.8 A causal association unifying comorbid autoimmune disease and NMOSD has not been established, and it is unknown if the association is better explained by genetic tendency toward autoimmunity.8 In contrast, co-occurring autoimmune disease is rare with MOGAD (choice D)9; indeed, serological testing for MOGAD was negative in this case.Initial therapy for acute episodes of NMOSD is intravenous corticosteroids. Refractory episodes may be treated with plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin.8,10 Long-term therapy uses immunosuppression. First-line immunosuppressive agents include azathioprine, rituximab, and mycophenolate mofetil. Second-line agents include methotrexate, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide.10The patient was treated with immunosuppressive therapy (initially methotrexate sodium and later mycophenolate mofetil) with concurrent slow taper of oral prednisone.

[Explanation]
The diagnosis of Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) associated with Sjögren syndrome is supported by several key factors in this clinical case:

1. Bilateral vision loss: The patient experienced sudden vision loss in both eyes, which is characteristic of NMOSD.

2. MRI findings: The MRI showed abnormal signal and contrast enhancement within the intraorbital midportion of both optic nerves, which is consistent with optic neuritis, a hallmark of NMOSD.

3. Response to corticosteroids: The patient's vision improved significantly after treatment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone, which is typical in NMOSD.

4. Negative temporal artery biopsy: This ruled out giant cell arteritis, which was initially suspected.

5. Sjögren syndrome association: The presence of bilateral parotid gland cysts on MRI and the patient's dry-eye syndrome suggest an underlying Sjögren syndrome. NMOSD is known to have a strong association with autoimmune disorders, particularly Sjögren syndrome.

6. Demographics: NMOSD is more common in Asian populations, which aligns with the patient's ethnicity.

7. Age and gender: While NMOSD typically affects younger women, it can occur in older individuals and men, as in this case.

The combination of bilateral optic neuritis, characteristic MRI findings, response to corticosteroids, and the association with Sjögren syndrome strongly supports the diagnosis of NMOSD associated with Sjögren syndrome.

Amyloid is an insoluble, fibrillar protein that can form tissue deposits, leading to functional impairment. The kidneys and heart are the most commonly affected organs in systemic amyloidosis. Primary localized conjunctival amyloidosis is a rare but well-described entity, most frequently affecting the palpebral conjunctiva and superior fornix.1 The diagnosis of amyloidosis is based on its characteristic histologic features that help differentiate it from other conditions, such as malignant neoplasms (lymphoma, squamous, or sebaceous cell carcinomas) and inflammatory disorders (pyogenic granuloma, sarcoidosis). Clinically, it is most easily distinguished from a more defined, pedunculated, and highly vascular pyogenic granuloma. Amyloid characteristically stains with Congo red and exhibits apple-green birefringence on polarization microscopy examination (Figure 2). Therefore, an incisional biopsy should be performed (choice D) for diagnostic purposes. This can also provide symptomatic relief by debulking the conjunctival mass with an estimated recurrence rate of less than 30%.1 A complete excisional biopsy (choice B) may be performed for solitary or more confined lesions, but it is less suitable for diffuse involvement of the conjunctiva as in this case.1,2 Unlike inflammatory conditions, localized conjunctival amyloidosis does not respond to corticosteroid therapy (choice A). Lubricants can provide temporary symptomatic relief; however, surgical debulking remains the mainstay of therapy. If orbital amyloidosis causes substantial ptosis, proptosis, or eye movement restrictions, further surgical intervention and targeted external beam radiotherapy may be considered.3,4Amyloid deposits in the conjunctival stroma staining with Congo red (original magnification ×100) and exhibiting apple-green birefringence under polarized light (original magnification ×200; inset).Histologic examination confirmed conjunctival amyloidosis of no specific subtype in this patient. More than 20 different types of amyloid protein have been described. Secondary amyloidosis occurs in the context of systemic conditions, leading to the accumulation of AA amyloid derived from the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A. In primary amyloidosis, immunoglobulin light-chain–derived protein (AL) deposits in tissues. The condition may be localized or associated with an underlying plasma cell disorder. In a small proportion of patients, systemic AL amyloidosis may eventually progress to multiple myeloma,5 whereas systemic AL amyloidosis may subsequently develop in approximately 1% of patients with multiple myeloma; this development confers a poor prognosis.6Conjunctival amyloidosis is usually primary and localized, with no systemic associations.1,4 However, a basic examination to rule out systemic disease is recommended.1 Investigations typically include a complete blood cell count, bone profile, kidney and liver function tests, urinalysis, and serum and urine electrophoresis.1 Presence of monoclonal gammopathy warrants further hematologic assessment by performing a bone marrow biopsy to exclude underlying multiple myeloma and other blood dyscrasias. Finally, ordering imaging of the orbits is useful to determine the extent of the condition, including any orbital involvement.2,4Performing the incisional biopsy sufficiently debulked the lesion to alleviate the patient’s ocular symptoms. At the 6-month follow-up, the conjunctival appearance remained stable. Systemic examination findings, including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits, bone marrow aspirate, and transthoracic echocardiogram, were unremarkable. Despite an elevated IgM level, no underlying plasma cell dyscrasia was identified.

[Explanation]
The next appropriate step in this case would be to perform a complete excisional biopsy of the conjunctival lesion. This decision is based on several key factors from the clinical presentation:

1.

Please analyze the following clinical case and the related question:

<clinical_case>
A 73-year-old Arab patient was referred to our service for assessment of a slow-growing conjunctival lesion in the left eye. They had first noticed left eye discomfort and a fullness of the left lower eyelid 3 months previously. They denied any vision or systemic symptoms. Their ophthalmic history was noncontributory. The Arab patient’s medical history was notable only for prostate carcinoma, which was treated with radiotherapy 12 years ago. On examination, their visual acuities were 20/25 OU. Slitlamp examination of the anterior segment revealed diffuse yellow-pink polypoidal papules affecting the inferior fornix and inferior palpebral conjunctiva of the left eye (Figure 1A). The upper palpebral conjunctiva in the left eye had a velvety yellow appearance (Figure 1B). The remainder of the examination of both eyes was unremarkable. Initial investigations, including a complete blood cell count, urinalysis, and measurement of inflammatory markers, kidney function, and prostate-specific antigen level, were within normal limits. Serum electrophoresis showed raised monoclonal IgM bands (7.25 g/L; reference range, 0.50-2.00 g/L) with a κ/λ light-chain ratio of 2.92 (reference range, 0.260-1.65).Clinical photographs of the left eye showing a diffuse yellow-pink lesion on the inferior palpebral conjunctiva (arrowheads) (A), and the yellow velvety appearance of the upper palpebral conjunctiva (arrowheads) (B).Perform a complete excisional biopsy of the lesionOrder magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits

Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy,B,Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy,"Evidence of motor dysfunction in multiple cranial nerves, marked distal muscle weakness and atrophy, and significant neurogenic lesions on muscle biopsy indicate axonal damage of multiple nerves or lesions of motor nuclei of the brainstem and spinal anterior horn. Meanwhile, facial sensory disturbance and the absence of the blink reflex suggests trigeminal nerve involvement. Juvenile and insidious onset and unrelenting gradual disease progression are indicative of genetic, degenerative, and metabolic diseases.Lesions with sensory and motor neuron involvement, including syringomyelia and syringobulbia, Sjögren syndrome, vasculitis, certain metabolic disorders, and immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy were precluded by negative laboratory, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological results. The normal lipid profile excluded Tangier disease, a rare autosomal recessive disorder with variants in the ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 gene (ABC1), characterized by reduced high-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein A through I.1 Multiple axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, in conjunction with pyramidal signs, may be linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2 with KIF5A, GDAP1, SPG11, MFN2, and GJB1 variants2; however, facial and trigeminal nerve involvement is rare. The involvement of upper and lower motor neurons may be linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); however, clinical symptoms related to sensory involvement and the absence of the blink reflex could not be explained by an ALS diagnosis.The clinical, electrophysiological, and biopsy results of this patient were most consistent with a diagnosis of facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN).3 Although uncommon, adolescent onset and signs suggesting upper motor neuron involvement have been reported in FOSMN.4-6FOSMN is a rare primary neurodegenerative disease first described by Vucic et al3 in 2006. The mean (range) age at onset of this disease is approximately 55 (38-83) years, with a single case of childhood-onset reported.6 Furthermore, the course and prognosis can vary significantly. This syndrome typically begins with sensory and motor symptoms associated with areas innervated by the trigeminal nerve and spreads to the bulbar, neck, and arms in a rostrocaudal direction.3 In some cases, patients initially report bulbar symptoms, such as dysarthria and dysphagia.4 As the disease progresses, cramps, fasciculations, and bulbar symptoms present, and patients with upper motor neuron impairment usually progress more rapidly.5 The abnormal blink reflex manifests with a delayed or absent R2 response and provides useful evidence for diagnosis.3 Reduced amplitudes of sensory nerve action potential were generally observed in the nerve conduction study, and chronic neurogenic changes and denervation-reinnervation changes were observed on electromyography.3 Neurogenic damage discovered in muscle biopsy, neuronal loss, and reactive gliosis are observed not only in the motor nucleus but also in the sensory nucleus and spinal trigeminal tract.3 The diagnosis of FOSMN is mainly based on the patient’s medical history and clinical presentation.To our knowledge, the pathogenesis and causative genes remain to be explored. Because of the presence of autoantibodies in several patients, the participation of immune mechanisms should be considered.7 As neuropathological studies of patients with FOSMN found transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)–positive glial inclusions8 and a heterozygous D90A-SOD1 variant was discovered in a patient9—although whether the variant in this patient was pathogenic or a polymorphism is unclear—there may be a connection to ALS. However, compared with the cortical hyperexcitability observed in ALS, the cortical excitability in patients with FOSMN is normal,10 suggesting that FOSMN may be a variant of ALS.",Neurology,2021-07-01,2021,7,"A 19-year-old White man presented with 4 years of facial numbness and 3 years of progressive dysarthria and dysphagia.

[Explanation]
The diagnosis of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS) is the most likely based on the clinical presentation and findings in this case. Here's why:

1. Age and progression: The patient is a young adult (19 years old) with a progressive neurological condition that started in adolescence, which is typical for BVVLS.

2. Cranial nerve involvement: The patient exhibits multiple cranial nerve deficits, including:
   - Facial numbness and bilateral peripheral facial paralysis (CN VII)
   - Dysarthria and dysphagia (CN IX, X, XII)
   - Absent corneal reflexes (CN V)
   - Reduced facial sensation (CN V)
   - Poor soft palate motility (CN X)

3. Motor neuron involvement: The patient shows signs of both upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction:
   - Progressive muscle weakness and atrophy in arms and legs
   - Absent reflexes in upper limbs (lower motor neuron)
   - Hyperreflexia and Babinski sign in lower limbs (upper motor neuron)

4. Sensory involvement: Reduced touch and vibration sensitivity in the mandible area.

5. Normal diagnostic tests: MRI, CSF analysis, and various blood tests were normal, which is consistent with BVVLS as it's primarily a clinical diagnosis.

6. Genetic testing: While no pathogenic variant was found on whole-exome sequencing, this doesn't rule out BVVLS as not all causative mutations may be detected by this method.

7. Electrophysiological findings: The nerve conduction study and EMG results showing axonal damage and chronic neuronal damage are consistent with BVVLS.

Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive pontobulbar palsy associated with sensorineural deafness. While hearing loss wasn't explicitly mentioned in this case, the constellation of symptoms, particularly the combination of cranial nerve deficits and motor neuron disease, strongly suggests BVVLS as the most likely diagnosis.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Video electroencephalography (EEG) captured the movements (Figure, A).

Faciobrachial dystonic seizures,C,Faciobrachial dystonic seizures,"Paroxysmal dyskinesia (choice B) is unlikely, because the phenomena are not triggered by movement or exertion, which would suggest kinesigenic or exercise-induced dyskinesia, respectively. Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia may occur, but the attacks would last minutes to hours rather than seconds. Furthermore, his age at onset is late for this group of genetic disorders. A tic disorder (choice D) is also unlikely, because there is no premonitory urge that is relieved by performing the tic, and the movement is not even briefly suppressible. The movement is jerky, but contractions are sustained for a few seconds, which is too prolonged for myoclonus (choice A) and more reminiscent of dystonic posturing.The phenomenology of the patient’s abnormal movement was most closely in keeping with faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS), and serum testing was positive for anti–leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI-1) antibodies by a cell-based assay. These tonic muscle contractions classically affect the lower face and ipsilateral arm, but involvement of the leg, alternating episodes, or bilateral episodes may occur.1 They are typically brief (<3 seconds) and can occur up to hundreds of times a day.2 These movements are nearly pathognomonic for anti–LGI-1 autoimmunity and can be seen in about half of patients with this trait.3 Although EEG is frequently obscured by muscle artifact, preceding rhythmic δ activity and EEG attenuation after FBDS may be seen.4 Associated ictal features may occur with FBDS, including fear, oral automatism, and/or loss of awareness.4The LGI-1 protein is secreted by neurons in the central nervous system and forms a transsynaptic complex involved in synaptic transmission of neuronal excitability.5 The association between LGI-1 protein dysfunction and altered neuronal excitability is seen in autosomal-dominant lateral temporal–lobe epilepsy, also known as autosomal-dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features, in which an LGI-1 gene mutation is identified in one-third to half of affected individuals.6 This disorder is usually characterized by a family history of focal seizures, often involving auditory auras (humming, buzzing, ringing, or [less frequently] complex sounds or distortions) or ictal aphasia in the absence of structural abnormalities or other substantial neurological deficits.6Anti–LGI-1 IgG4 antibodies are thought to be causative of LGI-1 encephalitis, which is the second most common cause of autoimmune encephalitis after anti–N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis and has an incidence of about 1 case per million population.5 Anti–LGI-1 autoimmunity often begins with subtle focal seizures or FBDS, which precede the onset of cognitive decline, personality changes, psychiatric symptoms, and tonic-clonic seizures typical of autoimmune limbic encephalitis.3 Other clinical manifestations include sleep disturbances, paroxysmal dizzy spells, parkinsonism, and myoclonus.7 Hyponatremia may be found in up to half of affected patients and can be a clue to the diagnosis. A malignant condition is identified in about 10% of patients and may occur in the thymus, lung, breasts, prostate, ovaries, kidneys, or alimentary tract.5 On magnetic resonance imaging, T2 hyperintensity of the medial temporal lobes is commonly found in patients with anti–LGI-1 limbic encephalitis, and T1 hyperintensity of the basal ganglia may be seen in patients with FBDS.7Recognition of FBDS is crucial to arrange for appropriate testing of anti–LGI-1 antibodies. Serum should be tested, because it may have a higher sensitivity than cerebrospinal fluid.3,7 Expedited immunotherapy in patients with FBDS is more effective than antiseizure medications to control the movements and is associated with reduced long-term disability.8 Early treatment may also prevent the evolution from FBDS to limbic encephalitis in patients with preserved cognition, further emphasizing the need to accurately diagnose these movements promptly.1 Even with immunotherapy, however, relapses can occur in one-third of patients,3 and close clinical monitoring is required so that treatment can be intensified if necessary.The patient was treated with 1-g doses of intravenous methylprednisolone for 5 days, with an oral prednisone taper that consisted of 50 mg daily for a month, followed by further decreases of 10 mg monthly.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD). This diagnosis is supported by several key features:

1. Nature of the episodes: The patient experiences brief, paroxysmal episodes of involuntary movements, which is characteristic of PKD. These episodes involve synchronous contractions of the right face, arm, and leg, lasting for a few seconds before spontaneous resolution.

2. Frequency and duration: The patient reports having these episodes up to 5 times a day, which is consistent with the frequent, short-lasting nature of PKD attacks.

3. Associated symptoms: The patient experiences expressive speech difficulties and mild disorientation during these episodes, which can occur in PKD.

4. Absence of EEG correlates: The EEG did not show any epileptic abnormalities correlating with the movements, which helps differentiate this condition from epilepsy.

5. Normal neuroimaging: The head MRI was unremarkable, which is typical in PKD as it is a functional rather than structural disorder.

6. Age of onset: While PKD typically begins in childhood or adolescence, adult-onset cases have been reported, making it a possible diagnosis for this patient in their 60s.

7. Lack of provocation by action or exertion: Although PKD is often triggered by sudden movements, some cases can occur spontaneously, as described in this patient.

While the presentation is somewhat atypical due to the patient's age and the apparent lack of clear triggers, the overall clinical picture is most consistent with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia. Other differential diagnoses such as epilepsy or structural brain lesions are less likely given the normal EEG and MRI findings.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Frequency and duration: The patient reports having these episodes up to 5 times a day, which is consistent with the frequent, short-lasting nature of PKD attacks.\n\n3. Associated symptoms: The patient experiences expressive speech difficulties and mild disorientation during these episodes, which can occur in PKD.\n\n4. Absence of EEG correlates: The EEG did not show any epileptic abnormalities correlating with the movements, which helps differentiate this condition from epilepsy.\n\n5. Normal neuroimaging: The head MRI was unremarkable, which is typical in PKD as it is a functional rather than structural disorder.\n\n6. Age of onset: While PKD typically begins in childhood or adolescence, adult-onset cases have been reported, making it a possible diagnosis for this patient in their 60s.\n\n7. Lack of provocation by action or exertion: Although PKD is often triggered by sudden movements, some cases can occur spontaneously, as described in this patient.\n\nWhile the presentation is somewhat atypical due to the patient's age and the apparent lack of clear triggers, the overall clinical picture is most consistent with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia. Other differential diagnoses such as epilepsy or structural brain lesions are less likely given the normal EEG and MRI findings."" response_metadata={'id': 'msg_vrtx_018qr1vyE4ZBvq9jWGwPJyLp', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 539, 'output_tokens': 414}} id='run-04610f9e-9216-4a1e-b785-e7afaec91c4a-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 539, 'output_tokens': 414, 'total_tokens': 953}",0.0

Head magnetic resonance imaging and venography with intravenous contrast showed bilateral otomastoiditis and right sigmoid sinus thrombosis (Figure 1). Bilateral myringotomy and tube placement produced thick purulent drainage that grew mixed aerobic flora. She continued broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics and began receiving ciprofloxacin drops to both ears. For the elevated ICP, she began 500 mg of oral acetazolamide daily. For the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin was started and later bridged to enoxaparin for a 3-month treatment course (choice B). After discharge, she completed a month of oral antibiotics. Six months later, her visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and her papilledema had resolved.Papilledema and CNVI palsies are rare complications of otitis media.2,3 Treatment strategies include antibiotics, surgery (myringotomy and/or mastoidectomy), and anticoagulation.4 Acetazolamide can be used if there are symptoms and/or signs of elevated ICP.4 Optic nerve sheath fenestration or cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures (choice C) can be considered when ICP does not respond to infection management or acetazolamide. Intravenous steroids (choice D) are not likely to improve ICP in this setting.A recent 10-year series4 found 13 patients with lateral sinus thrombosis among 156 patients with otitis media and/or mastoiditis. All of those with lateral sinus thrombosis also had cranial nerve (CN) palsies, primarily in CNVI or, more rarely, CNVII, and objective evidence of raised ICP. Another series2 found that 4 of 5 patients with both otitis media and dural venous sinus thrombosis also had papilledema and diplopia. Notably, neurologic symptoms and signs were often more prominent than otologic ones. Headache was the most common complaint. Additional symptoms included diplopia, CN palsies, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, and/or ataxia.4In otitis media, extension of the middle ear cavity infection and associated venous sinus wall inflammation cause a prothrombotic state, leading to CVST (Figure 2). Resulting venous drainage impairment causes raised ICP and associated headache, pulse-synchronous tinnitus, and transient visual obscurations. Elevated ICP causes downward brainstem herniation, CNVI traction, diplopia, and associated palsies. Subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid compression causes disrupted axoplasmic flow through the optic nerves, resulting in papilledema. Inflammation of the overlying dura may affect adjacent CNs.3 Untreated CVST may progress to meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, seizure, and death.5 Before antibiotics, mortality was as high as 80%; antibiotics have dropped the rate to 5% to 10%.5In otitis media, infection of the middle ear cavity and associated venous wall inflammation can extend into surrounding structures, creating a prothrombotic state and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Increased intracranial pressure results from impaired venous drainage, which can lead to papilledema and cranial nerve palsies, most commonly of the sixth (abducens) cranial nerve (CN). A indicates artery; n, nerve.Although meningitis may also present with CNVI palsy and papilledema, this patient lacked classic meningeal signs, such as nuchal rigidity, cerebrospinal fluid leukocytosis, or positive culture results. If the infection extends to the petrous apex, ipsilateral CNVI palsies and severe deep facial pain attributable to trigeminal nerve inflammation present as Gradenigo syndrome. This patient lacked petrous apex findings on magnetic resonance imaging and did not have the characteristic deep facial pain, making this an unlikely diagnosis. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension was unlikely, given identifiable causes of ICP, such as CVST and mastoiditis.Neurologic and ophthalmic complications of otitis media persist even in the era of modern antibiotic therapy.

[Explanation]
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, this patient is suffering from otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis, a rare but serious complication of acute otitis media. The key factors supporting this diagnosis are:

1. Initial presentation of ear pain and fever, consistent with acute otitis media
2. Progression to headaches, vomiting, and bilateral papilledema (suggesting increased intracranial pressure)
3. MRI findings showing right sigmoid sinus thrombosis and bilateral mastoiditis

Continuing antibiotic therapy is crucial to treat the underlying infection (otitis media and mastoiditis). The current regimen of intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin is appropriate for broad-spectrum coverage of potential pathogens.

Adding anticoagulation is the next critical step in managing this condition. Anticoagulation is necessary to prevent further propagation of the thrombus, reduce the risk of embolic complications, and facilitate recanalization of the affected sinus. Typically, low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin would be initiated, followed by oral anticoagulants for several months.

This approach addresses both the infectious and thrombotic components of the disease, which is essential for optimal management of otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis. Surgical intervention is not mentioned as an immediate necessity in this case, and the current antibiotic regimen appears appropriate, so continuing it while adding anticoagulation is the most suitable next step.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

This clinical finding most commonly appears in the posterior pole.1 Choroidal folds are further accentuated on fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography. B-scan ultrasonography may additionally demonstrate retinal and choroidal thickening with a flattening of the posterior globe. Choroidal folds should be differentiated from retinal folds, which are lighter and less distinct on fluorescein angiography and are commonly associated with optic disc edema (ie, Patton lines) or areas of retinal traction, as in epiretinal membranes or proliferative vitreoretinopathy.2The etiology of choroidal folds may stem from a series of etiologies. Gasperini et al3 proposed the mnemonic “THIN RPE” to recall the most common etiologies, which include tumor, hypotony, inflammation, idiopathic, neovascular membrane, retrobulbar mass, papilledema, and extraocular hardware (eg, scleral buckles or plaques).3 Idiopathic choroidal folds may be found bilaterally and are often associated with mild hyperopia. Scleral displacement by a retrobulbar lesion may induce choroidal distortion. Corrugations may also arise because of scleral shrinkage, in the setting of prolonged inflammation or traction, and from neovascular sub-RPE contraction.4-7A diagnostic workup for choroidal folds should be guided by the suspected etiology. In addition to a complete ophthalmologic examination (to include visual acuity), further evaluation with fluorescein angiography, echography, and optical coherence tomography may be indicated. Orbital imaging via magnetic resonance imaging with intravenous contrast should be pursued in cases of globe proptosis, ocular dysmotility, or other clinical features suggestive of an orbital lesion. Choroidal folds noted postoperatively may result from ocular hypotony. Pulsatile proptosis should prompt evaluation for a vascular lesion. Thyroid orbitopathy should always be considered in the setting of chronic unilateral exophthalmos once neoplasm has been excluded.Management varies based on the underlying pathology. With appropriate treatment, the best-corrected visual acuity is usually unaffected.8 Sequela of long-standing choroidal folds may include the development of a focal, beadlike RPE defect along a choroidal fold, which is sometimes followed by subretinal neovascularization.9,10The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and the results showed a large contrast-enhancing intraconal mass with medial displacement of the optic nerve (Figure 2). One week later he underwent lateral orbitotomy with en bloc resection of a well-encapsulated 2.5-cm violaceous lesion. Pathologic evaluation results revealed dilated, cavernous erythrocyte-filled vascular spaces separated by connective tissue stroma, consistent with a cavernous hemangioma.

[Explanation]
Given the clinical presentation and findings, the next appropriate step would be to perform orbital imaging. Here's why:

1. Proptosis: The patient presents with a bulging left eye and 5 mm of relative left proptosis. This suggests an orbital mass or other space-occupying lesion.

2. Visual changes: The patient reports frequent eyeglass prescription changes in the left eye over the past 2 years, and her current visual acuity in the left eye is reduced (20/40) compared to the right eye (20/20).

3. Ocular motility limitation: There is a mild limitation of left abduction and supraduction, which could indicate mass effect on the extraocular muscles.

4. Resistance to retropulsion: The moderate resistance to retropulsion of the left globe further supports the presence of an orbital mass.

5. Fundus abnormality: The dilated fundus examination revealed an abnormality of the posterior pole, which was confirmed on fluorescein angiography. This could be related to an orbital or retrobulbar lesion affecting the posterior segment of the eye.

6. History of melanoma: Although the patient has a history of right temple melanoma that was excised with clean margins and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, the possibility of metastasis or a new primary orbital tumor cannot be ruled out without further imaging.

Orbital imaging, such as CT or MRI, would provide detailed information about the presence, location, extent, and characteristics of any orbital mass or lesion. This information is crucial for determining the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and guiding further management or treatment decisions. Therefore, orbital imaging is the most appropriate next step in this clinical scenario.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.

Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy,D,Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy,"Electron microscopy of the vastus lateralis muscle biopsy identified nemaline rods within several muscle fibers (Figure 2). A diagnosis was made of sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy (SLONM) associated with monoclonal gammopathy. The patient received a 6-month trial of intravenous immunoglobulin without clinical improvement. He has subsequently been referred for hematological evaluation and potential autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.Electron micrograph (original magnification ×8200) demonstrating the presence of nemaline rods in a subsarcolemmal position along the periphery of a muscle fiber (white arrowhead).SLONM is a rare, acquired, adult-onset progressive myopathy first described by A. G. Engel in 1966.1 The typical clinical phenotype is characterized by weakness and atrophy of predominantly proximal and axial muscles, which may lead to camptocormia or head drop. Dysphagia and dyspnea are common, occurring in approximately 50% of cases,2 with respiratory failure a common cause of death.3 Cardiac involvement is reported, manifesting as conduction abnormalities and/or cardiomyopathy.2,4Creatine kinase levels are typically normal or mildly elevated, while electromyography shows myopathic motor units and fibrillation potentials.3 Magnetic resonance imaging may show preferential involvement of the neck extensors, paraspinal, gluteal, hamstring, and soleus muscles.4 The distinctive pathological hallmark of SLONM is the visualization of nemaline rods in myofibers on light or electron microscopy. Associated histopathological findings include myofiber atrophy, myofibrillar disintegration, corelike areas, vacuolar changes, fiber necrosis, inflammatory infiltrates, and mitochondrial changes.2 Importantly, initial muscle biopsy may be nondiagnostic in up to one-third of SLONM cases, necessitating a second muscle biopsy when clinical suspicion is high.5Key paraclinical associations of late-onset nemaline myopathy include monoclonal gammopathy and HIV infection. Monoclonal gammopathy is present in approximately 50% of SLONM cases and typically comprises an IgG paraprotein with either κ or λ light chains. Multiple myeloma is rare.2 It is important to note that late-onset nemaline myopathy is clinically and pathologically distinct from the congenital nemaline myopathies, although rare cases of adult-onset familial nemaline myopathy have been reported.6 As such, genetic testing should be considered in the presence of family history or if atypical features are present.The natural history of SLONM is progressive weakness leading to death usually within 1 to 5 years from symptom onset. There is conflicting evidence as to whether the presence of monoclonal gammopathy is associated with worse prognosis.3,5 SLONM, particularly when associated with monoclonal gammopathy, appears to be poorly responsive to immunotherapies.2,3 Nevertheless, some patients with SLONM demonstrate marked and sustained response to intravenous immunoglobulin, which has therefore been suggested as a first-line therapy.5 For patients who do not respond to immunotherapy, or for those with a more aggressive disease course, chemotherapy-based treatments with or without autologous stem cell transplantation have been shown to achieve higher rates of neurological improvement, complete remission, and overall survival.7,8",Neurology,2022-12-01,2022,12,"A 72-year-old Arab patient presented with mild proximal weakness developing into progressive camptocormia, head drop, and prominent dysphagia over a 2-year period.

[Explanation]

The diagnosis of sporadic late-onset nemaline myopathy (SLONM) is the most likely explanation for this patient's clinical presentation and biopsy findings. Here's why:

1. Age and onset: SLONM typically affects adults over 40, and this patient is 72 years old with symptoms developing over a 2-year period, which is consistent with the late-onset nature of the condition.

2. Clinical features: The patient presents with progressive proximal weakness, camptocormia (forward flexion of the spine), head drop, and dysphagia. These are characteristic features of SLONM, particularly the involvement of axial and proximal muscles.

3. Muscle biopsy findings: The second muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis revealed atrophic myofibers with a patchy granular appearance. This is highly suggestive of nemaline rods, which are the hallmark of nemaline myopathy.

4. Electromyography results: The EMG showed a myopathic pattern with small, brief, polyphasic units, particularly in proximal and axial muscles, which is consistent with SLONM.

5. Exclusion of other causes: The normal creatine kinase levels, unremarkable metabolic and endocrine screens, and the absence of significant findings on the first muscle biopsy help rule out other common myopathies.

6. Associated conditions: SLONM can be associated with monoclonal gammopathy, and this patient has a small IgG κ paraprotein, which further supports the diagnosis.

While the patient has some complicating factors like diabetes and a history of thyroid cancer, the overall clinical picture, progression of symptoms, and especially the muscle biopsy findings strongly point towards SLONM as the most likely diagnosis.","You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases.
