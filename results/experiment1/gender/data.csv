He reported intermittent itching and night sweats for 2 years. He denied fever, weight loss, shortness of breath, rashes, diarrhea, and neurological symptoms. On a preemployment evaluation, the patient was told he had a high white blood cell count 2 years ago. On examination, there was left cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other organomegaly. Complete blood cell count and peripheral blood smear showed marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22 340/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 5360/μL, and 55% eosinophils with an absolute eosinophil count of 12 290/μL (to convert all to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001).

Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions,D,Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions,"The differential diagnoses in young men with eosinophilia and a neck mass can be wide. The typical presentation of Kimura disease is a painless, unilateral swelling of cervical lymph nodes in young adult male patients with peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated immunoglobulin E levels. Histological evaluation, however, would show hyperplastic reactive follicles with eosinophilic infiltrates in a background of polymorphous inflammatory cells, a picture inconsistent with the presented case. Although Hodgkin lymphoma can present with eosinophilia and neck mass in young adults, the biopsy was inconsistent with the typical morphology of Reed-Sternberg cells in the background of nonneoplastic inflammatory cells. The diagnosis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia is reasonable given the morphology from lymph node biopsy; however, in the diagnosis hierarchy, myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions (MLN-TK) would supersede other myeloid and lymphoid cancers.1In the fifth edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Haematolymphoid Tumours, MLN-TK refers to BCR::ABL1–negative myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms with gene rearrangements leading to an activated tyrosine-kinase domain that results in cell-signaling dysregulation.1 This includes PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, JAK2, and FLT3 rearrangements, in addition to ETV6::ABL1, ETV6::FGFR2, ETV6::LYN, ETV6::NTRK3, RANBP2::ALK, BCR::RET, and FGFR1OP::RET fusions.1 An increase in vitamin B12 is often found in patients with PDGFRA and PDGFRB disease.2,3 Most patients are male with chronic myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia; however, patients rarely present with acute myeloid or T-cell leukemia or extramedullary disease.2Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was positive for FIP1L1::PDGFRA (4q12) fusion in 91% of nuclei, while karyotype was normal (46, XY in 18 cells), as a cryptic loss of the CHIC2 gene causes this fusion. Next, generation sequencing panel for myeloid neoplasms was negative for variants in targeted regions of the genes commonly involved in myeloid neoplasms. Combining imatinib with chemotherapy is acceptable in patients with acute leukemia or extramedullary diseases, although monotherapy with imatinib has shown promising results.4 The patient was concerned about fertility, as he and his partner were starting a family, and decided to avoid chemotherapy. The patient was concomitantly initiated on 1 mg/kg of prednisone for 7 days and imatinib at 600 mg daily. The eosinophil counts normalized after 2 days, and bone marrow evaluation after 4 weeks showed resolution of eosinophilic infiltration; however, FISH results were 3% positive for FIP1L1::PDGFRA fusion. Repeat bone marrow evaluation after 8 weeks showed complete resolution of the FISH abnormality, and the imatinib dose was reduced to 400 mg daily. Although studies have confirmed deep and durable remission with a starting dose of imatinib, 100 mg, we elected to start with a high dose given the patient’s young age and blastic presentation.5,6 Follow-up positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan 12 weeks after initiation of imatinib was consistent with complete metabolic remission (Figure, C). Complete hematological remission is achieved in more than 95% of patients with imatinib and is typically seen early (within weeks of treatment initiation). Cytogenetic/molecular response can be achieved within 3 to 6 months of treatment initiation.7 In patients who achieved molecular remission, the imatinib dose can be reduced to 100 thrice weekly or weekly.8 Treatment-free remission as the experience with chronic myeloid leukemia has been tried, although with limited experience. The success rate is around 60%, with most patients relapsing within the first 10 months. Reinitiating of imatinib restores hematological remission in almost all patients.9,10The current patient was in complete remission 12 months from his treatment and receiving imatinib.

A fungal culture grew Fusarium solani.Fusarium species are ubiquitous in soil and air, and transmission occurs through inhalation or direct cutaneous inoculation from a contaminated source.1 Localized infections can present as onychomycosis, superficial cutaneous infections, and keratitis in immunocompetent hosts; invasive and disseminated disease is more common in those who are immunocompromised, particularly those with neutropenia.2 In those with hematologic cancer, disseminated fusariosis most frequently involves the skin, blood, lungs, and sinuses.3Although the incidence of fusariosis among patients undergoing hematopoietic transplant is less than 1%, invasive fusariosis has a mortality rate of approximately 80% in individuals with hematologic cancer.4 Thus, early recognition is crucial for prompt treatment of the infection. Purpuric patches or papulonodules in this population should be evaluated urgently with skin biopsy and tissue culture. It is also recommended that patients with hematologic cancer who are about to receive chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplant first undergo a thorough examination for skin findings of onychomycosis, which has been associated with Fusarium infections.1,3,5The patient’s physical examination findings of scattered and painful purpuric papulonodules are similar to those found in invasive aspergillosis, which has an incidence of 2.7% in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant.4 Invasive aspergillosis is an infection caused by the fungal Aspergillus species, which is ubiquitous in the environment.6 As transmission is primarily through inhalation, invasive aspergillus most commonly presents with pulmonary or sinus disease that can then progress to dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. Both Aspergillus and Fusarium may cause elevated serum galactomannan antigen. Chest CT findings of invasive aspergillosis and disseminated fusariosis are similar, and both may show ground-glass opacities, segmental consolidation, cavitary lesions, and the “halo sign” (ground-glass opacities representing hemorrhage surrounding central fungal nodules). Lactophenol cotton blue staining of mold colony can differentiate between the 2 pathogens, as Aspergillus species have septate hyphae and flask-shaped vesicles.1,7Ecthyma gangrenosum is a cutaneous infection caused by hematogenous spread of bacteria, most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It most frequently occurs in immunocompromised individuals, including those with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.8 As this represents bacterial angioinvasion, ecthyma gangrenosum presents as purpuric macules that may become pustular or bullous before progressing to ulcers with overlying eschar most commonly in the anogenital and axillary areas. In most cases, Pseudomonas can be detected from tissue specimens, but blood culture results are often negative.9Sweet syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a rare disorder that is commonly associated with hematologic cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia. Sweet syndrome can also be associated with other states, such as autoimmune disease, or be due to medications, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Classic Sweet syndrome presents as tender, erythematous, and edematous plaques associated with fever and leukocytosis. Cutaneous involvement generally does not show overlying eschar, as seen in disseminated fusariosis. Skin biopsy histopathologic features can mimic infection with dermal edema and a dense infiltrate of neutrophils; however, the results of infectious stains and tissue culture will be negative. Systemic corticosteroids are often first-line treatments for Sweet syndrome.10The patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin B and voriconazole for disseminated fusariosis, with resolution of her cutaneous lesions over the course of 6 weeks.

(To convert the white blood cell and neutrophil counts to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001; conversion of the platelet count to cells ×109/L is 1:1.) Blood culture results were negative. The results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or mass effect. The results of a CT scan of the chest demonstrated multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities, scattered solid bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a moderately sized pericardial effusion. A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh was obtained for histopathologic examination and tissue culture, and wet mount preparation of a tissue culture colony was performed (Figure, B).A, Physical examination findings demonstrate dusky and pink papulonodules, some with overlying eschar, scattered on the scalp, neck, and extremities.

Disseminated fusariosis,A,Disseminated fusariosis,"Wet mount preparation of a tissue culture mold colony with lactophenol cotton blue staining revealed septated hyphae and oval microconidia (Figure, B). A fungal culture grew Fusarium solani.Fusarium species are ubiquitous in soil and air, and transmission occurs through inhalation or direct cutaneous inoculation from a contaminated source.1 Localized infections can present as onychomycosis, superficial cutaneous infections, and keratitis in immunocompetent hosts; invasive and disseminated disease is more common in those who are immunocompromised, particularly those with neutropenia.2 In those with hematologic cancer, disseminated fusariosis most frequently involves the skin, blood, lungs, and sinuses.3Although the incidence of fusariosis among patients undergoing hematopoietic transplant is less than 1%, invasive fusariosis has a mortality rate of approximately 80% in individuals with hematologic cancer.4 Thus, early recognition is crucial for prompt treatment of the infection. Purpuric patches or papulonodules in this population should be evaluated urgently with skin biopsy and tissue culture. It is also recommended that patients with hematologic cancer who are about to receive chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplant first undergo a thorough examination for skin findings of onychomycosis, which has been associated with Fusarium infections.1,3,5The patient’s physical examination findings of scattered and painful purpuric papulonodules are similar to those found in invasive aspergillosis, which has an incidence of 2.7% in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant.4 Invasive aspergillosis is an infection caused by the fungal Aspergillus species, which is ubiquitous in the environment.6 As transmission is primarily through inhalation, invasive aspergillus most commonly presents with pulmonary or sinus disease that can then progress to dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. Both Aspergillus and Fusarium may cause elevated serum galactomannan antigen. Chest CT findings of invasive aspergillosis and disseminated fusariosis are similar, and both may show ground-glass opacities, segmental consolidation, cavitary lesions, and the “halo sign” (ground-glass opacities representing hemorrhage surrounding central fungal nodules). Lactophenol cotton blue staining of mold colony can differentiate between the 2 pathogens, as Aspergillus species have septate hyphae and flask-shaped vesicles.1,7Ecthyma gangrenosum is a cutaneous infection caused by hematogenous spread of bacteria, most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It most frequently occurs in immunocompromised individuals, including those with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.8 As this represents bacterial angioinvasion, ecthyma gangrenosum presents as purpuric macules that may become pustular or bullous before progressing to ulcers with overlying eschar most commonly in the anogenital and axillary areas. In most cases, Pseudomonas can be detected from tissue specimens, but blood culture results are often negative.9Sweet syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a rare disorder that is commonly associated with hematologic cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia. Sweet syndrome can also be associated with other states, such as autoimmune disease, or be due to medications, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Classic Sweet syndrome presents as tender, erythematous, and edematous plaques associated with fever and leukocytosis. Cutaneous involvement generally does not show overlying eschar, as seen in disseminated fusariosis. Skin biopsy histopathologic features can mimic infection with dermal edema and a dense infiltrate of neutrophils; however, the results of infectious stains and tissue culture will be negative. Systemic corticosteroids are often first-line treatments for Sweet syndrome.10The patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin B and voriconazole for disseminated fusariosis, with resolution of her cutaneous lesions over the course of 6 weeks. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis of disseminated fusariosis, especially for those who are immunocompromised or undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.",Oncology,"A 56-year-old patient with a history of multiple myeloma complicated by therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia was admitted for myeloablative conditioning in preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.

141,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2803624,"A 75-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with isolated deletion 5q (del5q) presented with multiple nonhealing skin ulcers on the chest and upper extremities. Four years earlier, he started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, he became transfusion independent. Since then, he has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility.Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors. Results of Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver staining were unremarkable.A, Hematoxylin-eosin staining shows polymorphonuclear neutrophils admixed with scattered histiocytes and vasculatures with a prominent endothelial lining.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Leukemia cutis,Pyoderma gangrenosum,Leukocytoclastic vasculitis,Lymphomatoid papulosis,B. Pyoderma gangrenosum,B,Pyoderma gangrenosum,"Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis (ND) characterized by painful erythematous or inflammatory papules that often progress to ulcers with a violaceous border.1 A large cohort study showed that PG is commonly associated with other systemic disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (41% of participants), inflammatory arthropathies (21%), hematological malignancies (11%), and solid tumors (7%),2 with an overall incidence of 0.63 per 100 000 person-years.3 It frequently occurs in young or middle-aged adults (median age, 51.6 years) and it is more common in women.2Cutaneous lesions in PG mimic lesions of other skin disorders, and no finding is pathognomonic for PG. Therefore, diagnosis of PG depends largely on clinical history, histological findings, and exclusion of other inflammatory or ulcerative cutaneous diseases.1,2 While early-stage PG shows intradermal neutrophils and perifollicular inflammation, ulcerative PG at later stages typically demonstrates epidermal or dermal necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and abscess formation.1 Deposition of IgM, C3, and fibrin can be observed in PG, but these findings are nonspecific.4 There are 4 morphologic subtypes of PG. Ulcerative PG is characterized by rapid progression of inflammatory papules, pustules, or vesicles to ulcerative lesions. Bullous PG is characterized by rapid development of inflammatory bullae. Pustular PG commonly occurs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease during an acute exacerbation. Vegetative PG is characterized by localized and superficial lesions with an indolent disease course.1The pathogenesis of PG depends primarily on immune dysregulation and genetic factors. Previous studies have shown that gene expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor α and interleukins [ILs] IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, IL-23, and IL-36) and levels of pattern recognition receptors are increased in the cutaneous lesions of PG, leading to activation of inflammasomes and dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunities.1 Furthermore, several reports from familial cases of PG suggest that genetic factors can play important roles in PG pathogenesis,5 and variants in PTSTPIP1/CD2BP1, MEFV, NLRP3, NLRP12, NOD2, and LPIN2 have been reported in PG.1Among hematological cancers associated with PG, 10% to 20% of patients with MDS develop autoimmune manifestations that include NDs, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet disease, and vasculitis.6 Chromosomal abnormalities commonly identified in patients with MDS and their autoimmune manifestations include del5q (22.6% of participants in one study),7 in which haploinsufficiency of RPS14 from del5q upregulates S100A9, a DAMP (damage-associated molecular pattern) protein, that plays essential roles in chronic inflammation and innate immunity.8 Notably, ND was associated with significantly adverse survival outcomes in patients with MDS in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.03-3.09; P = .04),7 although other studies found that overall prognosis was more closely related to the IPSS (International Prognostic Scoring System) category than to the underlying autoimmune process.9 In addition, PG has been reported to be associated with lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug that is commonly used to treat MDS, multiple myeloma, and lymphomas,10 although the exact frequency of PG associated with lenalidomide remains to be determined.Treatment of PG varies depending on severity and extent of involved cutaneous lesions. First-line treatment for limited disease includes topical corticosteroid or tacrolimus.1 For patients with extensive or rapidly progressing disease, a systemic steroid (0.5-1.5 mg/kg/d of prednisone or its equivalent, then taper over 4-6 weeks) or cyclosporin (in patients who cannot tolerate systemic steroids) is recommended as the first-line treatment, and adjunctive agents (eg, infliximab, azathioprine, mycophenolate) can be added to prevent disease flare during steroid taper.1 In cases of refractory disease, intravenous immunoglobulin or alkylating agents (eg, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil) could be an option, although many other agents (eg, melphalan, thalidomide, canakinumab, tocilizumab) have been reported to be effective.1In this patient, lenalidomide was discontinued and he was treated with methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg/d, and infliximab, 5 mg/kg.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Leukemia cutis,Pyoderma gangrenosum,Leukocytoclastic vasculitis,Lymphomatoid papulosis,B. Pyoderma gangrenosum,B,Pyoderma gangrenosum,"Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis (ND) characterized by painful erythematous or inflammatory papules that often progress to ulcers with a violaceous border.1 A large cohort study showed that PG is commonly associated with other systemic disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (41% of participants), inflammatory arthropathies (21%), hematological malignancies (11%), and solid tumors (7%),2 with an overall incidence of 0.63 per 100 000 person-years.3 It frequently occurs in young or middle-aged adults (median age, 51.6 years) and it is more common in women.2Cutaneous lesions in PG mimic lesions of other skin disorders, and no finding is pathognomonic for PG. Therefore, diagnosis of PG depends largely on clinical history, histological findings, and exclusion of other inflammatory or ulcerative cutaneous diseases.1,2 While early-stage PG shows intradermal neutrophils and perifollicular inflammation, ulcerative PG at later stages typically demonstrates epidermal or dermal necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and abscess formation.1 Deposition of IgM, C3, and fibrin can be observed in PG, but these findings are nonspecific.4 There are 4 morphologic subtypes of PG. Ulcerative PG is characterized by rapid progression of inflammatory papules, pustules, or vesicles to ulcerative lesions. Bullous PG is characterized by rapid development of inflammatory bullae. Pustular PG commonly occurs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease during an acute exacerbation. Vegetative PG is characterized by localized and superficial lesions with an indolent disease course.1The pathogenesis of PG depends primarily on immune dysregulation and genetic factors.

Bilateral diagnostic mammography revealed a high-density irregular mass in the left axilla with no nodules, architectural distortions, or microcalcifications in the breasts. Ultrasonography of the left breast showed a 4.6-cm lobulated mixed cystic and solid left axillary mass. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing 5.2-cm left axillary mass with no breast lesions (Figure 1A).

High-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin,B,High-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin,"This patient underwent left axillary excisional lymph node biopsy, peritoneal washings, laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omental biopsy, and bilateral ureterolysis. Laparoscopy revealed that both ovaries were affixed to the pelvic peritoneum with adhesions, requiring bilateral ureterolysis. The uterus, cervix, and proximal fallopian tubes were surgically absent. On gross examination the distal fallopian tubes appeared unremarkable, and the left ovary appeared nodular. Given the clinical scenario, the fimbrial ends of the fallopian tubes were entirely excised and submitted for microscopic examination along with both ovaries. Microscopic examination revealed a residual 2.1-mm focus of high-grade serous carcinoma (Figure 2) involving the fimbrial end of the left fallopian tube. No omental involvement was seen. The immunostaining pattern was similar to that seen in the axillary metastasis prior to therapy. No residual carcinoma was identified in the left axillary lymph node. The patient’s cancer antigen 125 level was 13 U/mL before the surgery. Disease was staged as FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage IVB, and the patient received additional platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Test results were negative for germline pathogenic sequence variants, including BRCA1 and BRCA2.Hematoxylin-eosin–stained biopsy specimen of the left fallopian tube fimbria at low power (A) and high power (B) shows residual high-grade adenocarcinoma invading into the stroma (arrowheads).Although metastatic ovarian or tubal serous carcinoma typically first spreads locally within the abdomen or peritoneum, distal extra-abdominal involvement is well established.1 An isolated axillary mass rarely presents as the initial sign of ovarian or tubal serous carcinoma, and there are few cases reported.2-4 Unlike other patients, this patient was initially treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a presumptive diagnosis of an occult breast cancer with axillary metastasis. After histopathologic reassessment and additional immunostaining at our institution, the treatment plan was adjusted accordingly. Her initial diagnostic evaluation included clinical history, radiography, and pathologic examination. Given the pathologic findings, location of the malignant neoplasm, and positive hormone receptor expression, this case was misdiagnosed as breast cancer at the outside institution. Immunohistochemical staining was key to reaching the correct diagnosis.Clinical management of axillary nodal metastases of carcinoma of unknown primary (CUPAx) is challenging. A systematic review reported that 72% of the patients with CUPAx treated with prophylactic mastectomy had an occult primary cancer of the breast,5 which implied that a thorough investigation of breast origin might be appropriate and could avoid unnecessary surgeries. In these situations, immunostaining can offer more insight but only to a limited extent. Greco et al6 evaluated diagnoses based on molecular profile, immunostaining (median of 6 stains), and clinical findings, and reported that diagnoses among all 3 modalities were consistent for only 34% of the patients. Some markers may provide evidence implying the primary site; for example, TTF-1 and thyroglobulin are relatively specific for thyroid cancer, CK7 and GATA3 are highly suggestive of breast cancer, and CK7, WT1, and PAX8 are indicative of gynecological adenocarcinoma.7,8 While estrogen and progesterone receptors are frequently evaluated in breast cancers, they can also be expressed in ovarian cancer, and some evidence supports their prognostic value.9,10 Thus, infradiaphragmatic primary malignant neoplasm should not be completely excluded when positive hormone profiles are present.Ovarian serous papillary adenocarcinoma initially presenting as axillary lymph node metastasis is rare. When managing CUPAx, primary sites other than the breast should be explored. Thorough clinical history, physical examination, and histopathologic evaluation of the biopsy specimen in conjunction with immunostaining is invaluable in establishing a diagnosis.",Oncology,"A 76-year-old woman presented with a palpable left axillary mass.

On gross examination the distal fallopian tubes appeared unremarkable, and the left ovary appeared nodular. Given the clinical scenario, the fimbrial ends of the fallopian tubes were entirely excised and submitted for microscopic examination along with both ovaries. Microscopic examination revealed a residual 2.1-mm focus of high-grade serous carcinoma (Figure 2) involving the fimbrial end of the left fallopian tube. No omental involvement was seen. The immunostaining pattern was similar to that seen in the axillary metastasis prior to therapy. No residual carcinoma was identified in the left axillary lymph node.

They are more prevalent in men at a median age of 60 years. The cutaneous form is more common in elderly White men.4 To our knowledge, it has not been described in association with allogeneic HSCT or MF previously.The skin is the most commonly involved organ, predominantly on the head and neck.3 Chronic lymphedema and radiation therapy are primary risk factors, along with familial syndromes, environmental chemical toxins, and foreign bodies.4 Radiation therapy contributes to one-fourth of all cases.3 Immunosuppression may be a risk factor, although the effect is unknown, as angiosarcomas have been reported in kidney transplant patients who have subsequent immunosuppression.5Treatment usually requires a multidisciplinary approach, but the recurrence rate remains high. Surgical resection and therapeutic agents, such as cytotoxic therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, have been applied. Data are lacking regarding best treatment plans because angiosarcoma is so rare and much of the literature exists in case reports.6The diagnosis of angiosarcoma can be difficult to establish, as initial presentation can be mistaken for a bruise or hemangioma, and delays in diagnosis have been previously reported with a median of 5.1 months.7 As the tumor grows, further cutaneous signs may develop with tissue infiltration, edema, ulceration, and hemorrhage.4 Repeated evaluation is key when there is clinical suspicion of malignant transformation. In this article, we presented a case of a patient who developed a cutaneous angiosarcoma in the setting of a known history of chronic graft vs host disease following receipt of radiation to the sites to treat his underlying MF, ablative therapy for bone marrow transplant, and subsequent immunosuppression.",Oncology,"A patient in their 50s presented with bleeding wounds and nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms. They previously received failed systemic and radiation therapy for tumor stage mycosis fungoides (MF). They had received 11 courses of extended beam radiation therapy, including 3 courses of total skin irradiation of 24 to 30 Gy, and focal irradiation to the left posterior thigh and hip/buttock with 2.5/3 Gy to 12.5/24 Gy, respectively, and the right posterior thigh and hip with 2 Gy to 20 and 26 Gy, respectively. Seven years before this visit, they underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Their post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which they received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, they developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and their forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. They underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on their left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on their right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. They was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole. Positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) results did not show evidence of visceral or extracutaneous disease.Recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on the left lateral hip.",what is your diagnosis?,What is your diagnosis?,Angiosarcoma,Granulation tissue,Opportunistic fungal infection,"Atypical infection, nocardia",a,1,1,1,1,neutral,0,0,55.0,51-60,,76,augmented_neutral_frommale

Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) with invasive ductal carcinoma and treated with systemic chemotherapy. It is important to note that the history of receiving the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is a red herring in this case.It is challenging to differentiate between adnexal tumors and breast cancer when the patient presents with a cutaneous lesion of the breast. The current patient presented with a widespread rash, retracted nipple, and a peau d’orange appearance of the skin commonly seen in patients with IBC.1 However, peau d’orange skin can also be seen in patients with cellulitis and radiation-induced lymphatic blockage.2 The atypical cells obtained from a skin punch biopsy stained positive for GATA-3 and CK-7. GATA-3 belongs to the GATA family of zinc-finger transcription and is involved in the development and morphogenesis of breast tissue.3 It is commonly expressed in ER-positive breast cancers. However, the expression of GATA-3 is not exclusive to breast cancer and has been reported in tumors of the salivary gland, urothelial system, skin and adnexa, mesothelioma, and pancreas.4 Breast glands are considered to be modified and highly specialized apocrine glands. Hence, they share structural and functional homology with sweat glands.5In addition to staining positive for GATA-3, adnexal tumors stain positive for P63, CK5/6, and CK-7. The clinical picture of the current patient was challenging due to the lack of a discrete breast mass and a positron emission tomography scan demonstrating an FDG-avid infiltrating mass in the chest wall and several lymph nodes in the axillary and internal mammary chain. A core-needle biopsy of the chest wall mass showed a similar staining pattern but stained positive for ER, unlike the punch biopsy of the skin, which was negative for both ER and progesterone receptor. However, a positive ER status alone is not sufficient to differentiate between an adnexal gland tumor and breast cancer.6 The diagnosis was finally established with the results of the positive molecular testing for CDKN2, ERBB2, and PIK3CA. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases-CA (PIK3CA) variation is highly associated with ER-positive/ERBB2-negative breast cancer.7 Likewise, ERBB2 (also known as HER2 or neu) is expressed in 30% of breast cancers.8 Limited studies in patients with adnexal gland tumors reported no expression of PIK3CA or ERBB2 in such patients.9 Hence, the current patient’s pattern of the molecular profile of tumor tissue was most consistent with carcinoma of breast origin.Breast cancer in men accounts for 1% of all breast cancers.10 Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive form of breast cancer that accounts for 2% to 4% of all breast cancers and 7% to 10% of breast cancer mortality in the US.

He denied systemic complaints such as weakness, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Oral glucocorticoids did not show any therapeutic effect. His medical history was remarkable for mild anemia because of untreated hemorrhoids. Physical examination revealed numerous symmetrically distributed, well-defined, erythematous skin nodules on his back, buttocks, and limb extensors (Figure, A). Prominent lymphadenopathies on bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes were noted, with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 5 × 2 cm. Laboratory tests were significant for atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (count up to 6%), an elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio (9.21; normal range, 0.7-3.1), moderate anemia (hemoglobin level, 8.7 g/dL; normal range, 11.5-15.0 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (35 mm/h; normal range, 0-25 mm/h), and cryoglobulins composed of mixed polyclonal immunoglobulins.

The lymphocytes stained positively for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL6, and PD1 and were negative for CD20, CD30, or CD56, indicating a T follicular helper (TFH) phenotype. The Ki-67 labeling index was 40%. In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) demonstrated scattered positivity (Figure, C).A positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan showed increased glucose accumulation on the skin nodules (standardized uptake value, 7.7) and multiple lymph nodes (standardized uptake value, 1.7-4.9). The lymph node biopsy showed total effacement of nodal architecture, diffuse infiltration of medium-sized lymphocytes with pale cytoplasm in a polymorphous inflammatory background containing plasma cells and eosinophils, and marked proliferation of HEVs. The immunostaining revealed a TFH phenotype and expanded follicular dendritic cell (FDC) meshwork. Monoclonal rearrangements of T-cell receptor genes and positive EBER were also revealed. Then, the diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) was made. Genetic profiling identified hotspot RHOAG17V sequence variation, DNMT3AG543A sequence variation, and 2 TET2 frameshift sequence variations (Q1526fs and E1728fs) in both skin and lymph node tissues. Bone marrow biopsy showed no lymphoma involvement. The patient received chemotherapy and achieved complete remission after 6 cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone). His skin nodules subsided remarkably after the first cycle.Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is a common aggressive form of peripheral T-cell lymphoma arising from CD4+ TFH cells.1 Patients typically present with the acute onset of a systemic illness (fever, weight loss, and/or night sweats) and generalized lymphadenopathy. The lymph node biopsy demonstrates a polymorphous infiltrate including atypical lymphocytes that are positive for TFH cell markers and a prominent proliferation of HEVs and FDCs. Epstein-Barr virus infections are present in 66% to 91% of patients with AITL.2 Epstein-Barr virus–positive B immunoblasts are detected by in situ hybridizations for small nuclear EBERs in areas between FDCs. Sequence variations in TET2, RHOA, DNMT3A, and IDH2 are recurrent in AITL. The hotspot RHOAG17V sequence variation occurs in 50% to 70% of patients with AITL.2Skin manifestations occur in up to 50% of patients with AITL. These lesions can be categorized as nonspecific macular or papular eruptions mimicking drug/viral exanthemas and plaque-like or nodular lesions that are more likely to be recognized as lymphomatous.3 The histopathology of cutaneous AITL is not specific, usually presenting as nodular or perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes with or without cytological atypia.4,5 The positive rates of BCL6, CXCL13, and PD-1 in the skin lesion reach up to 43%, 62%, and 81%, respectively.5 Other extranodal involvement, including hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, frequently presents in AITL.Immune system–mediated abnormalities are common in AITL and can include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hemolytic anemia, cryoglobulins, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.

Immunotherapy-related gastritis,B,Immunotherapy-related gastritis,"This case highlights an increasingly common circumstance encountered in the management of patients with advanced liver cancer as well as other solid tumors—diagnostic considerations for an acute medical issue in a patient with a long-term response to ongoing immunotherapy.1,2 Here, the patient had been receiving treatment for 18 months without evidence of active liver cancer and presented with epigastric pain, a common clinical complaint with a broad differential diagnosis.3 The evaluation must consider the presence of chronic liver disease and metastatic HCC, as well as the potential complications of immunotherapy.As the median progression-free survival with metastatic HCC being treated with frontline immunotherapy is only 3.7 to 6.8 months, worsening abdominal pain warrants immediate assessment for progressive cancer.1,2 Normal AFP level and atypical imaging findings of gastric body thickening are inconsistent with HCC disease recurrence. Secondary malignant neoplasm (eg, gastric cancer) occurs in about 3% of patients with HCC and is a consideration given radiographic findings, though the biopsy specimen showed no malignant neoplasm.4Portal hypertensive gastropathy occurs due to cirrhosis or in the noncirrhotic liver affected with extensive cancer or portal vein tumor thrombus.5 Portal vein involvement by HCC occurs in up to 40% of patients with advanced disease and may lead to abnormal EGD findings.1 Portal hypertensive gastropathy rarely manifests as epigastric discomfort and has a characteristic fine reticular appearance of the gastric mucosa (snakeskin appearance) on EGD with pathologic findings of capillary ectasia and dilated mucosal and submucosal veins.5Here, pathology review showed lymphocytic gastritis, which can be associated with celiac disease, Crohn disease, infection, and drug effect. Although infectious gastritis (ie, H pylori and cytomegalovirus) is plausible, no pathogens were detected on special stains, and the radiographic findings were atypical for this entity.The diagnostic workup was most consistent with immunotherapy-related gastritis as a late complication of long-term anti–programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) therapy. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are now well documented and are an on-target toxic effect of PD-1/PD-L1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) pathway interference—reactivating T-cell–mediated antitumor activity with a cost of breaking immunological self-tolerance. Immune-related adverse events may affect multiple organs with varying severity and time to onset. In a meta-analysis of 7936 patients with advanced solid tumors, gastrointestinal toxic effects were the second most common irAEs observed in 10.7% (95% CI, 8.9%-13.0%) of patients treated with nivolumab, and in 33.6% (95% CI, 27.2%-40.6%) of patients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab.6 Only about 1% of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy have been reported to have immune-mediated gastritis, which presents with epigastric pain, anorexia, and emesis, with varied time to onset from weeks to up to 3 years.7-9 As in this case, EGD often shows fragile antral mucosa with erosions or ulcerations.8,9 Biopsy is characterized by severe inflammatory cell infiltration in the epithelium and lamina propria.Treatment of immune-mediated gastritis includes proton pump inhibitors and glucocorticoids, with options for refractory cases including use of infliximab, vedolizumab, or mycophenolate mofetil.7,9 As with other irAEs, retreatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy may be possible; however, up to 26% may experience recurrence of the same irAE, while another 26% may develop a new irAE.10 As the treatment of lymphocytic gastritis varies considerably based on cause, it is critical for pathologic review and special stains to rule out alternative causes.The patient’s symptoms improved with cessation of anti–PD-1 therapy, a course of corticosteroids, sucralfate, and indefinite proton pump inhibitor therapy. Twenty months later, she developed a new solitary lung metastasis. She received 5 additional doses of nivolumab without recurrence of gastritis and underwent successful oligo-metastasectomy.

Immunotherapy-related gastritis,B,Immunotherapy-related gastritis,"This case highlights an increasingly common circumstance encountered in the management of patients with advanced liver cancer as well as other solid tumors—diagnostic considerations for an acute medical issue in a patient with a long-term response to ongoing immunotherapy.1,2 Here, the patient had been receiving treatment for 18 months without evidence of active liver cancer and presented with epigastric pain, a common clinical complaint with a broad differential diagnosis.3 The evaluation must consider the presence of chronic liver disease and metastatic HCC, as well as the potential complications of immunotherapy.As the median progression-free survival with metastatic HCC being treated with frontline immunotherapy is only 3.7 to 6.8 months, worsening abdominal pain warrants immediate assessment for progressive cancer.1,2 Normal AFP level and atypical imaging findings of gastric body thickening are inconsistent with HCC disease recurrence. Secondary malignant neoplasm (eg, gastric cancer) occurs in about 3% of patients with HCC and is a consideration given radiographic findings, though the biopsy specimen showed no malignant neoplasm.4Portal hypertensive gastropathy occurs due to cirrhosis or in the noncirrhotic liver affected with extensive cancer or portal vein tumor thrombus.5 Portal vein involvement by HCC occurs in up to 40% of patients with advanced disease and may lead to abnormal EGD findings.1 Portal hypertensive gastropathy rarely manifests as epigastric discomfort and has a characteristic fine reticular appearance of the gastric mucosa (snakeskin appearance) on EGD with pathologic findings of capillary ectasia and dilated mucosal and submucosal veins.5Here, pathology review showed lymphocytic gastritis, which can be associated with celiac disease, Crohn disease, infection, and drug effect. Although infectious gastritis (ie, H pylori and cytomegalovirus) is plausible, no pathogens were detected on special stains, and the radiographic findings were atypical for this entity.The diagnostic workup was most consistent with immunotherapy-related gastritis as a late complication of long-term anti–programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) therapy. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are now well documented and are an on-target toxic effect of PD-1/PD-L1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) pathway interference—reactivating T-cell–mediated antitumor activity with a cost of breaking immunological self-tolerance. Immune-related adverse events may affect multiple organs with varying severity and time to onset. In a meta-analysis of 7936 patients with advanced solid tumors, gastrointestinal toxic effects were the second most common irAEs observed in 10.7% (95% CI, 8.9%-13.0%) of patients treated with nivolumab, and in 33.6% (95% CI, 27.2%-40.6%) of patients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab.6 Only about 1% of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy have been reported to have immune-mediated gastritis, which presents with epigastric pain, anorexia, and emesis, with varied time to onset from weeks to up to 3 years.7-9 As in this case, EGD often shows fragile antral mucosa with erosions or ulcerations.8,9 Biopsy is characterized by severe inflammatory cell infiltration in the epithelium and lamina propria.Treatment of immune-mediated gastritis includes proton pump inhibitors and glucocorticoids, with options for refractory cases including use of infliximab, vedolizumab, or mycophenolate mofetil.7,9 As with other irAEs, retreatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy may be possible; however, up to 26% may experience recurrence of the same irAE, while another 26% may develop a new irAE.10 As the treatment of lymphocytic gastritis varies considerably based on cause, it is critical for pathologic review and special stains to rule out alternative causes.The patient’s symptoms improved with cessation of anti–PD-1 therapy, a course of corticosteroids, sucralfate, and indefinite proton pump inhibitor therapy.

Immunostaining for CD31 and D2-40 highlighted the vessel walls, and surprisingly, the staining pattern outlined the intravascular nature of all the neoplastic cells (Figure, C).

The presence of general symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and drenching night sweats, has been reported in some patients with IALCL.5,6 The DUSP22 gene is not specific for primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, but some cases of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma with DUSP22 translocation display prominent intravascular involvement.7,8 Of note, it has been postulated that most of the so-called IALCLs have intralymphatic origin and demonstrate a tropism to lymphatic channels, like the case reported here that was both D2-40 positive and CD31 positive.7 Because lymphovascular channels were involved with this patient, it was challenging to distinguish IALCL from systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Nevertheless, the lesions in the patient presented here were located exclusively on the skin during a 2-year period and lacked ALK and EMA expression, which supported categorization of this case at one end of the spectrum of the primary cutaneous disease process with propensity to lymphovascular involvement.8The main differential diagnoses of IALCL are large B-cell lymphoma and NKTCL. Large B-cell lymphoma expresses B-cell–associated antigens (CD20, CD79a, Bcl-2, MUM-1), and NKTCL is positive for CD3ε, CD56, EBER, and cytotoxic markers.4 Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma should also be differentiated from metastatic carcinoma.

Immunostaining for CD31 and D2-40 highlighted the vessel walls, and surprisingly, the staining pattern outlined the intravascular nature of all the neoplastic cells (Figure, C). Results of fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis performed on 4-μm tissue sections revealed 6p25.3 rearrangements (DUSP22 rearrangement). Positron emission tomography imaging did not show substantial lymphadenopathy or evidence of visceral involvement. The patient was referred to the Department of Hematology for further management, but she refused and then was lost to follow-up.Three variants of intravascular lymphoma have been described: intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL), and intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma (IALCL).1-3 In comparison with the counterpart of large B-cell origin and natural killer/T-cell origin, IALCL is exceptionally rare, and, to our knowledge, only 10 definite cases have been reported.3-6 Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma can show exclusive skin involvement or extracutaneous dissemination, such as to the regional lymph nodes or lung.3,4 Patients with IALCL documented in previous limited reports commonly presented with solitary or localized nodules or tumors. The presence of general symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and drenching night sweats, has been reported in some patients with IALCL.5,6 The DUSP22 gene is not specific for primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, but some cases of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma with DUSP22 translocation display prominent intravascular involvement.7,8 Of note, it has been postulated that most of the so-called IALCLs have intralymphatic origin and demonstrate a tropism to lymphatic channels, like the case reported here that was both D2-40 positive and CD31 positive.7 Because lymphovascular channels were involved with this patient, it was challenging to distinguish IALCL from systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Nevertheless, the lesions in the patient presented here were located exclusively on the skin during a 2-year period and lacked ALK and EMA expression, which supported categorization of this case at one end of the spectrum of the primary cutaneous disease process with propensity to lymphovascular involvement.8The main differential diagnoses of IALCL are large B-cell lymphoma and NKTCL. Large B-cell lymphoma expresses B-cell–associated antigens (CD20, CD79a, Bcl-2, MUM-1), and NKTCL is positive for CD3ε, CD56, EBER, and cytotoxic markers.4 Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma should also be differentiated from metastatic carcinoma. Physical examination and imaging studies can help provide the evidence of primary solid tumor, and immunohistochemistry aids in identifying the origin of the tumor cells.Treatment experience specific for IALCL is limited in the previous literature. The preferred mode of treatment for a solitary or few localized nodules or tumors is radiotherapy or surgical excision. In patients with only a few multifocal skin lesions, radiotherapy or treatment with low-dose methotrexate is preferred. Doxorubicin-based multiagent chemotherapy is used in the case of rapidly progressive skin disease or systemic involvement.4-7 Brentuximab vedotin, an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, has become a new standard of care for relapsed or refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma.9Compared with the other 2 types of intravascular lymphoma, intravascular NKTCL and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, IALCL has a favorable prognosis and generally follows an indolent clinical course,3-5 though relapse after treatment also has been reported. This case highlights the importance of establishing the diagnosis of IALCL because it may suggest a completely different treatment and prognosis.",Oncology,"A 79-year-old patient presented with a 2-year history of asymptomatic erythematous-infiltrated patches and plaques on the right side of them scalp and face. The lesions gradually enlarged and coalesced into large plaques and nodules. Mild erosions occurred occasionally on the surface of the lesions. They denied having fever, fatigue, chills, night sweats, or weight loss.Physical examination demonstrated ill-defined, indurated erythematous-violaceous patches, nodules, and plaques involving the surface of them head and face with sporadic erosion and brownish crusts (Figure, A). The findings of systemic reviews were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy. The complete blood cell count revealed normal white blood cell count. The biopsy from an erythematous nodule displayed sheets of medium to large mononuclear cells infiltrated in the dermis, some of which filled and expanded apparent dermal blood vessels and had large, irregular, pleomorphic nuclei (Figure, B). In addition, some neoplastic cells formed a balloon appearance. No epidermotrophism was found.

One such alteration is FGFR2 fusions, which is identified in 15% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.2,3 In April 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for pemigatinib, an oral inhibitor of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3. Common adverse effects affecting more than 30% of patients receiving oral therapy include alopecia, dysgeusia, diarrhea, and fatigue.4 Overall, the most common adverse effect of pemigatinib is hyperphosphatemia, which develops in approximately 60% of patients.2Calciphylaxis is a rare skin disorder characterized by calcification within the lumen of the blood vessels in the adipose tissue and dermis occurring from dysregulation of calcium and/or phosphate metabolism. The intravascular calcium deposition can lead to ischemia with resultant painful necrosis of the overlying skin.5 Patients typically present with noninflammatory retiform purpura with necrosis, and the clinical differential diagnosis for this presentation includes other causes of noninflammatory retiform purpura, such as oxalate vasculopathy, cholesterol emboli, and type I cryoglobulinemia. Because of the clinical similarities between these entities, histopathologic examination is required to differentiate between the various causes of retiform purpura.Established risk factors for calciphylaxis include chronic kidney disease, obesity, hyperparathyroidism, female sex, diabetes mellitus, warfarin use, and protein C or S deficiency. However, a case of calciphylaxis in a patient receiving erdafitinib treatment, an FGFRi, for stage IV adenosarcoma was recently reported in the literature.6 The association with calciphylaxis is in the setting of a known adverse effect of hyperphosphatemia, which occurs in approximately 70% to 80% of patients taking the medication.7 Fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors interfere with normal FGF23/FGFR signaling in the kidneys and impairs kidney excretion of phosphate. The result is an abnormal calcium-phosphate product leading to calcium deposition in the tissues.8Most data to support treatment for calciphylaxis are extrapolated from case studies, retrospective studies, and observational studies. General principles of management include discontinuation of the FGFRi, prompt dermatology consult, wound care (if necrosis is present), and pain management. Treatment aimed at addressing the hyperphosphatemia includes counseling patients on avoiding foods high in phosphorus and may require a non–calcium-containing phosphate binder. It is equally important to manage calcium levels, and patients should be advised to stop any vitamin D or calcium supplementations. Treatment of calciphylaxis with intravenous sodium thiosulfate 3 times a week for approximately 3 to 4 weeks or until appropriate symptom relief has shown efficacy in improvement.9 The use of bisphosphonates can also be considered.Treatment for this patient included discontinuation of pemigatinib treatment followed by a bisphosphonate and sodium thiosulfate (3 times weekly) along with pain management and wound care. The patient is still receiving supportive care with minimal improvement after 4 weeks. This case highlights the importance of recognizing skin toxic effects from FGFRi therapy and demonstrates the value of early involvement of dermatology consultation in these cases.

She subsequently underwent a radical resection of the pelvic mass, which revealed a 4-cm mass deriving from and encapsulating the right external iliac vein with R1 margins, which was replaced with an interposition graft.Retinoblastoma is the most common pediatric ocular tumor. The hereditary variant, which is caused by germline variations to the tumor suppressor gene RB1, comprises 40% of all retinoblastoma and is generally associated with bilateral disease.1 Long-term survival of these patients is typically excellent; however, there remains a 33.1% risk of developing a secondary cancer.2,3 This has important implications for monitoring survivors of hereditary retinoblastoma. The median time to development of a subsequent cancer is 18.9 years, and bone and soft-tissue sarcomas comprise most (40%-60%) subsequent cancers, followed by melanoma, accounting for approximately 10%.3 Among soft-tissue sarcomas (STS), LMS is most common, comprising at least 40% of all STS diagnosed in patients with retinoblastoma with a median age at presentation of approximately 32 years.3 Other commonly diagnosed subsequent STS include fibrosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.3 Prior treatment with radiation or chemotherapy may increase the risk of a subsequent cancer.4 Radiotherapy is a risk factor for developing a subsequent cancer within the treatment field, and alkylating agents, in particular, seem to increase systemic risk of subsequent cancer. Patients who were treated with radiotherapy and an alkylating agent before age 1 year, as with this patient, may have up to 3.8 times greater risk of developing LMS.4Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant mesenchymal tumor that is typically found in the head, neck, thorax, abdomen, retroperitoneum, limbs, uterus, and pelvis of patients with retinoblastoma.3 Leiomyosarcoma of large blood vessels comprises approximately 2% of LMS and is often found in the inferior vena cava, femoral, saphenous, jugular, or iliac veins.5Prognosis is based on histologic grade, tumor size, and tumor depth.6 Extrauterine LMS has a 40% 5-year risk of recurrence following resection, and for uterine LMS, the recurrence rates are as high as 70%.6 To our knowledge, there are few studies to guide optimal treatment of early-stage disease. Surgical resection is the standard for local disease, and offers a chance at a cure with R0 resection.6 Adjuvant radiotherapy in early-stage disease has been shown to decrease the risk of local recurrence; however, a recent large, randomized clinical trial of patients with retroperitoneal LMS demonstrated a limited utility of adjuvant radiotherapy.6,7 Adjuvant chemotherapy has not been shown to improve outcomes for patients with uterine LMS.8 There have been studies that attempt to risk stratify and identify patients with nonuterine LMS who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy; however, these patients are part of broader studies on the treatment of STS and those with LMS are not the primary study population.6,9 There are few data on advanced LMS, although most first-line regimens tend to include doxorubicin-based therapy.6This patient’s case was discussed among the tumor board and given positive margins and a high-grade pathology; she received adjuvant proton radiotherapy to the margin edge with close monitoring for recurrence. This case reflects the importance of close monitoring of patients with a history of hereditary retinoblastoma, with a particular emphasis on screening for bone and STS as well as melanoma.

Leiomyosarcoma,A,Leiomyosarcoma,"The patient underwent a transvenous biopsy with an inferior vena cava filter, and pathology results were consistent with a leiomyosarcoma (LMS), grade 3. Computed tomography results of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were negative for metastatic disease. She subsequently underwent a radical resection of the pelvic mass, which revealed a 4-cm mass deriving from and encapsulating the right external iliac vein with R1 margins, which was replaced with an interposition graft.Retinoblastoma is the most common pediatric ocular tumor. The hereditary variant, which is caused by germline variations to the tumor suppressor gene RB1, comprises 40% of all retinoblastoma and is generally associated with bilateral disease.1 Long-term survival of these patients is typically excellent; however, there remains a 33.1% risk of developing a secondary cancer.2,3 This has important implications for monitoring survivors of hereditary retinoblastoma. The median time to development of a subsequent cancer is 18.9 years, and bone and soft-tissue sarcomas comprise most (40%-60%) subsequent cancers, followed by melanoma, accounting for approximately 10%.3 Among soft-tissue sarcomas (STS), LMS is most common, comprising at least 40% of all STS diagnosed in patients with retinoblastoma with a median age at presentation of approximately 32 years.3 Other commonly diagnosed subsequent STS include fibrosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.3 Prior treatment with radiation or chemotherapy may increase the risk of a subsequent cancer.4 Radiotherapy is a risk factor for developing a subsequent cancer within the treatment field, and alkylating agents, in particular, seem to increase systemic risk of subsequent cancer. Patients who were treated with radiotherapy and an alkylating agent before age 1 year, as with this patient, may have up to 3.8 times greater risk of developing LMS.4Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant mesenchymal tumor that is typically found in the head, neck, thorax, abdomen, retroperitoneum, limbs, uterus, and pelvis of patients with retinoblastoma.3 Leiomyosarcoma of large blood vessels comprises approximately 2% of LMS and is often found in the inferior vena cava, femoral, saphenous, jugular, or iliac veins.5Prognosis is based on histologic grade, tumor size, and tumor depth.6 Extrauterine LMS has a 40% 5-year risk of recurrence following resection, and for uterine LMS, the recurrence rates are as high as 70%.6 To our knowledge, there are few studies to guide optimal treatment of early-stage disease. Surgical resection is the standard for local disease, and offers a chance at a cure with R0 resection.6 Adjuvant radiotherapy in early-stage disease has been shown to decrease the risk of local recurrence; however, a recent large, randomized clinical trial of patients with retroperitoneal LMS demonstrated a limited utility of adjuvant radiotherapy.6,7 Adjuvant chemotherapy has not been shown to improve outcomes for patients with uterine LMS.8 There have been studies that attempt to risk stratify and identify patients with nonuterine LMS who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy; however, these patients are part of broader studies on the treatment of STS and those with LMS are not the primary study population.6,9 There are few data on advanced LMS, although most first-line regimens tend to include doxorubicin-based therapy.6This patient’s case was discussed among the tumor board and given positive margins and a high-grade pathology; she received adjuvant proton radiotherapy to the margin edge with close monitoring for recurrence. This case reflects the importance of close monitoring of patients with a history of hereditary retinoblastoma, with a particular emphasis on screening for bone and STS as well as melanoma. Current expert recommendation includes an annual physical examination at a long-term survivor clinic, patient education, and consideration of screening whole-body magnetic resonance imaging.10",Oncology,"A 33-year-old patient with a history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma as an infant presented to a primary care clinic with 1 week of right lower extremity swelling. At age 8 months, they was treated with right enucleation and left eye radiotherapy (50.4 Gy). At age 4 years, they developed a recurrence of the retinoblastoma in the nasal cavity and was treated with 4 cycles of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by 1 cycle of cisplatin, etoposide, and intrathecal cytarabine.Primary care evaluation was prompted by them mother, as the patient had not noticed them lower extremity edema.

Intracapillary atypical cells were positive for melanin-A (Figure, C), Sry-related HMg-Box gene 10, S-100, and human melanoma black–45 stains, which indicated the presence of melanoma micrometasases.

Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma,A,Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma,"Skin biopsy results revealed diffuse, nonepidermotropic infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells involving the entire dermis and extending to the subcutis (Figure, C). The infiltrating cells were medium sized, round to oval, with slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and distinct oval-shaped or kidney-shaped basophilic nuclei. They stained positively for CD45, MPO, KP-1, and CD43 and were negative for CD3, CD123, CD20, CD34, CD56, CD117, and CD138, compatible with primitive myeloid cells. Mitotic figures were noted. Bone marrow biopsy results showed no evidence of leukemic involvement. Results of subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis performed on paraffin sections of the skin biopsy did not reveal 11q23/MLL rearrangement or t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) rearrangement. Neither NPM1 nor FLT3 variation was detected in the skin lesion.Myeloid sarcoma (also known as extramedullary myeloid tumor or granulocytic sarcoma) is characterized by leukemic cells of a myeloid lineage infiltrating an extramedullary location and typically occurs in the following settings: as a forerunner of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients without leukemia, as the acute leukemic progression of myelodysplastic syndrome or blast crisis in chronic myeloid leukemia, or as relapse of antecedent AML.1-3 It has been reported at nearly every anatomic site and is most frequently encountered in the skin and soft tissues, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal tract.4 When the leukemia cells infiltrate specifically in the skin, cutaneous myeloid sarcoma has been referred to as leukemia cutis. There is a wide age distribution; however, myeloid sarcoma appears to be more common in the pediatric age group, with an incidence of up to 30% in children with AML vs 2% to 5% in adults.4,5Leukemia may manifest in the skin as a leukemid reaction or, less commonly, as cutaneous myeloid sarcoma. Leukemids represent nonspecific changes in the skin and most commonly result from bone marrow failure or humoral response to the primary tumor.1 In contrast, cutaneous myeloid sarcoma denotes the specific infiltration of neoplastic myeloid cells.1 It presents as multiple papules, plaques, or nodules with a characteristic reddish-brown or violaceous color. The most commonly involved region is the torso, although the head and neck regions and the extremities, as well as the mucosal region, can also be involved.5 Skin manifestation without evidence of systemic disease is referred to as aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma, but its presence is sufficient to establish a clinical diagnosis of AML. Previous studies have suggested that bone marrow involvement would become detectable in nearly all patients, with a mean interval of 10 months.5Recognition of this cutaneous phenomenon remains important for further classification and early diagnosis of myeloid leukemia. Nevertheless, diagnosis is often difficult owing to the presentation of isolated cutaneous findings outside the context of systemic disease.1 Histologically, cutaneous lesions show diffuse or nodular dermal infiltrates, with sparing of the upper papillary dermis.

This infiltrate spilled into the surrounding interstitium. No leukemic or infective cells were seen, and the epidermis and upper dermis were relatively unremarkable. These findings are consistent with neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH).A rare condition with characteristic histopathological findings, NEH has variable clinical features.1,2 Most often, NEH presents in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy for hematological malignant neoplasms, particularly acute myeloid leukemia.2 Although cytarabine is considered to be the most common causative agent, other cytotoxic medications, including daunorubicin, decitabine, BRAF inhibitors, cetuximab, and imatinib, have been described as causing NEH.1,2 Non-antineoplastic agents described as causative include acetaminophen, adalimumab, azathioprine, and G-CSF, among others.1 Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis has been observed in other clinical settings, affecting patients with HIV, solid organ malignant neoplasms, and infections; among pediatric patients, it can occur without a precipitating event.1,3,4The cause of NEH remains speculative. Given the numerous clinical settings in which NEH presents, it is best considered a clinicopathological reaction pattern.1,3,4 When seen in the context of medication, it has been suggested that neutrophilic inflammation is caused by direct cytotoxicity of the drug secreted in sweat through the eccrine coils.2The clinical presentation of NEH generally includes erythematous nodules and plaques that are variably painful.1,2 The trunk and extremities are often affected, and lesions also can occur on the face, scalp, and acral surfaces.1,2,4 Associated features can include fever and pathergy.2The diagnosis of NEH relies on histopathologic evaluation and shows distinctive perieccrine neutrophils and leukocytoclasis with subsequent necrosis and vacuolar change along the basement membrane underlying the eccrine epithelium. Edema, mucin deposition, cellular atypia, and syringosquamous metaplasia occur as variable reactive changes.2After identifying and removing the trigger, management of NEH is mostly supportive; generally, recovery is spontaneous and without scarring.1,2 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral corticosteroids, and dapsone are therapeutic options described in the literature.1,2,5 Topical medications are thought to be ineffective given the depth of the inflammation.2 Chemotherapy can be continued if the associated symptoms are tolerable; if not, a change in the regimen may be advisable. Subsequent episodes of NEH can occur if the patient receives the same chemotherapy regimen.2In this patient, the lesions resolved in 1 week with only supportive management. Several weeks later, the patient required a new course of G-CSF (5 consecutive days), and the lesions did not recur. Therefore, cytarabine was the most likely trigger of NEH in this patient. The patient proceeded to bone marrow transplant and so, was not rechallenged with cytarabine. While we cannot exclude an infectious trigger, it was considered less likely because no infective organism was identified at the time of diagnosis.Sweet syndrome is a differential diagnosis of NEH. Both are classified under neutrophilic dermatoses and have overlapping features. Associations for both include hematological cancers and medication, specifically G-CSF.

Usually associated with acute myeloid leukemia, it is a poor prognostic sign.6 Histopathological features consist of a deeper dermal and subcutaneous infiltrate with monotonous, atypical myeloblasts and myelocytes and variable immunohistochemical expression.7Finally, in urticaria, the erythematous wheals are pruritic and evanescent.

Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis,C,Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis,"Results of the patient’s punch biopsy demonstrated a leukocytoclastic neutrophilic infiltrate in the deeper dermis, around the appendage structures and the coiled eccrine glands. This infiltrate spilled into the surrounding interstitium. No leukemic or infective cells were seen, and the epidermis and upper dermis were relatively unremarkable. These findings are consistent with neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH).A rare condition with characteristic histopathological findings, NEH has variable clinical features.1,2 Most often, NEH presents in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy for hematological malignant neoplasms, particularly acute myeloid leukemia.2 Although cytarabine is considered to be the most common causative agent, other cytotoxic medications, including daunorubicin, decitabine, BRAF inhibitors, cetuximab, and imatinib, have been described as causing NEH.1,2 Non-antineoplastic agents described as causative include acetaminophen, adalimumab, azathioprine, and G-CSF, among others.1 Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis has been observed in other clinical settings, affecting patients with HIV, solid organ malignant neoplasms, and infections; among pediatric patients, it can occur without a precipitating event.1,3,4The cause of NEH remains speculative. Given the numerous clinical settings in which NEH presents, it is best considered a clinicopathological reaction pattern.1,3,4 When seen in the context of medication, it has been suggested that neutrophilic inflammation is caused by direct cytotoxicity of the drug secreted in sweat through the eccrine coils.2The clinical presentation of NEH generally includes erythematous nodules and plaques that are variably painful.1,2 The trunk and extremities are often affected, and lesions also can occur on the face, scalp, and acral surfaces.1,2,4 Associated features can include fever and pathergy.2The diagnosis of NEH relies on histopathologic evaluation and shows distinctive perieccrine neutrophils and leukocytoclasis with subsequent necrosis and vacuolar change along the basement membrane underlying the eccrine epithelium. Edema, mucin deposition, cellular atypia, and syringosquamous metaplasia occur as variable reactive changes.2After identifying and removing the trigger, management of NEH is mostly supportive; generally, recovery is spontaneous and without scarring.1,2 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral corticosteroids, and dapsone are therapeutic options described in the literature.1,2,5 Topical medications are thought to be ineffective given the depth of the inflammation.2 Chemotherapy can be continued if the associated symptoms are tolerable; if not, a change in the regimen may be advisable. Subsequent episodes of NEH can occur if the patient receives the same chemotherapy regimen.2In this patient, the lesions resolved in 1 week with only supportive management. Several weeks later, the patient required a new course of G-CSF (5 consecutive days), and the lesions did not recur. Therefore, cytarabine was the most likely trigger of NEH in this patient. The patient proceeded to bone marrow transplant and so, was not rechallenged with cytarabine. While we cannot exclude an infectious trigger, it was considered less likely because no infective organism was identified at the time of diagnosis.Sweet syndrome is a differential diagnosis of NEH. Both are classified under neutrophilic dermatoses and have overlapping features. Associations for both include hematological cancers and medication, specifically G-CSF. Sweets syndrome presents with fever and tender erythematous nodules and plaques.1 Histologically, however, Sweets syndrome shows a more dense, predominantly dermal, neutrophilic infiltrate with prominent dermal edema and no perieccrine accentuation.1Leukemia cutis can present with indurated nodules or plaques that may be erythematous.

Occasional Staphylococcus and Candida species represent colonization rather than primary infection, and treatment with topical and oral antibiotics does not lead to resolution. Low-quality evidence supports first-line treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids and topical tacrolimus.3Cetuximab is an epidermal growth factor inhibitor (EGFRI) that is indicated for treatment of KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and advanced, metastatic, or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. EGFRIs interfere with normal growth and differentiation of epidermal cells and hair follicles and thus have high potential for skin toxic effects. Common cutaneous adverse effects of EGFRIs include xerosis, pruritus, acneiform papulopustular eruptions, nail changes (paronychia, pyogenic granuloma–like lesions, brittleness, onycholysis), hair changes (alopecia [scarring and nonscarring], eyelash trichomegaly), mucositis (oral, ocular, genital), and photosensitivity.4,5 Severe cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have rarely been reported. Importantly, development of an EGFRI-induced cutaneous eruption has been shown to be positively correlated with both progression-free and overall survival and may forecast the therapeutic response.4This patient was also being treated with a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BRAFi + MEKi), which itself has the potential for cutaneous adverse effects. These include morbilliform exanthems, papulopustular eruptions, pruritus, xerosis, alopecia, photosensitivity, palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia, panniculitis, and keratinocytic proliferations (actinic keratoses, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, keratoacanthomas). Compared with BRAFi monotherapy, the incidence of keratinocytic proliferations is reduced by combination BRAFi + MEKi therapy.6Our review of the literature revealed 5 cases of EGFRI therapy associated with EPDS-like eruptions, 4 (80%) of which occurred in East Asian women.5,7-10 Culprit medications included cetuximab, gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, suggesting a class effect. Disease onset ranged from 1 to 36 months after initiation of treatment. Treatment of Staphylococcus colonization in several cases had no impact on skin findings, whereas administration of topical and oral corticosteroids showed variable efficacy.

Perform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation",D,"Perform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation","The pathological findings of the patient’s CT-guided biopsy were compatible with inflammation or SLR. The main feature of this patient was the mild presenting symptom but with the rapid development of consolidated lung with interstitial pneumonia on his CT scan. The diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was rejected because the patient had a dry cough only, and findings of bronchial washings were negative. Disease recurrence was considered, but the decreasing carcinoembryonic antigen levels  seemed inconsistent. Although a similar CT finding can be found in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)–induced interstitial lung disease (ILD), the mild symptom was incompatible with this diagnosis. There was no direct evidence to support the change of treatment to chemotherapy or steroids. With this in mind, clinicians must consider rebiopsy, and the diagnosis of the SLR was compatible with clinical symptoms and CT findings.Cancer-associated SLR is characterized by epithelioid cell granulomas with T-cell infiltration in pathologic findings (Figure, B) and observed in patients with hematological malignancies or solid tumors. In contrast to sarcoidosis with systemic involvement, cancer-associated SLR is usually asymptomatic, and the incidence of SLR lymphadenopathy in lung cancer ranges from 1.3% to 11%.1 Sarcoid-like reaction with ground-glass pulmonary infiltrates or lung consolidation is rare. Although fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is useful for evaluating the recurrence of lung cancer, it has been reported to produce false-positive results in cases of SLR.2Sarcoid-like reactions  are elicited by antigenic factors released from the tumor cells and are mostly identified in the lymph nodes draining a malignant tumor. These antigenic factors may be either shed by the tumor cells or released during tumor necrosis. Therefore, such reactions can be identified at diagnosis or after chemotherapy and immunotherapy.3 In infiltrating tumors, the production of interferon gamma by local natural killer cells and T cells activates the dendritic cells, which then present the antigen to naive CD4+ T cells, converting them into T helper 1 cells and contributing to the maturation of macrophages and granuloma formation. In an observational cohort study of 127 patients with lung cancer undergoing curative resection, 19 (14.9%) had coexistent granulomatous inflammation in the resected specimen.1 Some treatments for cancer may produce necrotic material or metabolic substances and induce granulomatosis, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for bladder cancer and interleukin-2 treatment for kidney cell carcinoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed the therapeutic landscape for lung cancer, and several reports have described the development of SLRs after the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 inhibitors.4 Assessing the expression of programmed cell death (PD) 1 and PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients receiving nivolumab therapy, a recent study showed that an elevated expression of PD-L1 sequential to blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction can be associated with SLRs.5Although SLRs have been reported in patients receiving chemotherapy and immunotherapy, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a pulmonary consolidation pattern in a patient with ROS1 rearrangement receiving an anaplastic lymphoma kinase/ROS1 inhibitor. Sarcoid-like reactions often respond to corticosteroid treatment and do not require the discontinuation of treatment. Conversely, in TKI-induced ILDs, the destroyed endothelium of alveolar vessels or pneumocytes leads to the release of cytokines and the recruitment of more inflammatory cells that, in turn, induce more damage to the endothelial cells.6 Deaths associated with TKI-induced ILD have been reported, and permanent discontinuation of TKIs is required in severe cases.In this case, while the patient’s dry cough was not severe, he decided to halt his crizotinib use. He further refused steroid use and asked to resume the ceritinib treatment. His dry cough improved substantially, and the lung consolidation lesion subsequently decreased (Figure, B). In conclusion, in cases involving a radiological pattern of disease progression, such as a new lung consolidation lesion associated with TKI use, our article suggests that a routine rebiopsy is needed to confirm the SLR and avoid misinterpretation.",Oncology,"A 69-year-old man with a smoking history and complaints of back pain and cough for 2 weeks was found to have a right lung mass on chest radiography results.

879,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2770033,"The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of a rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3N2bM0) diagnosed 9 years prior. Following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, low anterior resection, and 6 cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX therapy (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin), he had developed a lung metastasis (KRAS wild type) 1 year later. He subsequently developed multiple lung metastases treated with palliative local interventions (lobectomy, radiofrequency ablation) and 4 lines of chemotherapy. Owing to symptomatic lung disease, he was enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT03502733) following informed consent and achieved a confirmed partial response. After 9 months, contrast computed tomography restaging scans noted a new, 1-cm posterior subglottic lesion of unclear origin (Figure, A). He had no shortness of breath or noisy breathing, dysphagia, voice change, or hemoptysis. A partial response was maintained without evidence of progression of lung disease.A, An axial computed tomographic image reveals a new posterior subglottic lesion (pink arrowhead) of unclear etiology. B, In the operating room, the larynx was exposed with a Lindholm laryngoscope, and a Hopkins rod-lens endoscope was used to photograph the lesion under apneic conditions. C, Photomicrograph (original magnification ×20) of a section of the mass stained for CDX2 via standard immunohistochemical techniques.Otolaryngology was consulted to assess the lesion. The differential diagnosis based on imaging included a mass vs inspissated mucus. Examination using distal-chip flexible laryngoscopy revealed a 1-cm, broad-based, exophytic mass along the posterior wall of the subglottis with prominent vasculature. No other anatomic abnormalities in the upper aerodigestive tract or cervical lymphadenopathy were noted. The decision was made to proceed to the operating room for definitive endoscopic biopsy under general anesthesia (Figure, B). Examination revealed a subglottic mass that did not extend inferiorly beyond the caudal aspect of the cricoid cartilage. The mass was debulked and sent to pathology for analysis, including hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining (Figure, C). What Is Your Diagnosis?",Tracheal granuloma,Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma,Subglottic squamous cell carcinoma,Subglottic papilloma,B. Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma,B,Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma,"Subglottic malignant neoplasm is rare. In a large review of 160 000 laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas, 2% were in the subglottis.1 Even rarer is the rate of metastatic lesions to the larynx from other primary sites, comprising 0.09% to 0.4% of laryngeal tumors.2 A literature review performed by Zenga et al3 in 2016 identified 41 cases of metastatic spread to the larynx from various primary tumor sites, the most common of which was colorectal adenocarcinoma (24%) followed by renal cell carcinoma (15%) and prostate carcinoma (15%).This patient’s biopsy specimen was identified as a colorectal adenocarcinoma metastasis based on the characteristic appearance of tubular glandular tissue within a stromal matrix on hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining for CDX2. A transcription factor within the nucleus, CDX2 is a marker for enteric (intestinal) differentiation and is identifiable via immunohistochemistry in greater than 90% of intestinal adenocarcinomas.4 Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 (Thermo Fisher) revealed a pathogenic NRAS (c.182A>G) and TP53 (c.673-1G>A) variation.

After induction of anesthesia and verification that the patient could be mask ventilated, a chemical paralytic agent was administered, and the entire glottis was exposed with a Lindholm laryngoscope. The procedure itself was performed under apnea with the endotracheal tube removed, and ventilation was achieved as needed by carefully passing a 5.0 endotracheal tube with the cuff beyond the lesion under direct visualization with Hopkins rod-lens endoscopy.This case illustrates the importance of a multimodality approach to the diagnosis of airway lesions when biopsy results can alter the recommended direction of therapy.

It is typically self-limited and appears to be dose- and schedule-dependent. Most cases are mild (common terminology criteria grade 1 or 2 diarrhea)2 and require no specific therapy aside from antidiarrheals for symptomatic relief. In rare instances of more severe diarrhea (common terminology criteria grade 3 or 4), patients may require dose reduction or a discontinuation of capecitabine. Only 11.4% of patients who experience diarrhea while on capecitabine have grade 3 or 4 diarrhea.3Reports of capecitabine causing terminal ileitis are very rare. The severity of diarrhea appears to be more profound than the self-limited, secretory diarrhea more typically seen with capecitabine exposure. Cases have been associated with severe volume depletion necessitating intravenous hydration, electrolyte derangement, need for parenteral nutrition, fevers, elevated white blood cell counts, and elevated serum and stool inflammatory markers.4,5 Endoscopy results reveal superficial, although extensive, ulcerations throughout the terminal ileum with mucosal edema and erythema. Histopathology results reveal crypt abscesses with a substantial amount of inflammatory cells and debris, which are predominantly neutrophils, although scattered eosinophils can be seen.Management includes prompt discontinuation of capecitabine, although careful consideration of the implications to the treatment of a patient’s underlying cancer and whether suitable alternative agents are available should be determined.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Cytomegalovirus ileitis,Capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis,Ileal metastasis,Small bowel carcinoid tumor,B. Capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis,B,Capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis,"Capecitabine is an oral prodrug to fluorouracil with cytotoxic effects as an antimetabolite and is used often, in conjunction with oxaliplatin, in treating various gastrointestinal cancers, including in metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma, for which it has been shown to be a viable treatment option.1 Watery diarrhea has been well described as an adverse reaction, reported in up to 67% of cases. It is typically self-limited and appears to be dose- and schedule-dependent. Most cases are mild (common terminology criteria grade 1 or 2 diarrhea)2 and require no specific therapy aside from antidiarrheals for symptomatic relief. In rare instances of more severe diarrhea (common terminology criteria grade 3 or 4), patients may require dose reduction or a discontinuation of capecitabine. Only 11.4% of patients who experience diarrhea while on capecitabine have grade 3 or 4 diarrhea.3Reports of capecitabine causing terminal ileitis are very rare. The severity of diarrhea appears to be more profound than the self-limited, secretory diarrhea more typically seen with capecitabine exposure. Cases have been associated with severe volume depletion necessitating intravenous hydration, electrolyte derangement, need for parenteral nutrition, fevers, elevated white blood cell counts, and elevated serum and stool inflammatory markers.4,5 Endoscopy results reveal superficial, although extensive, ulcerations throughout the terminal ileum with mucosal edema and erythema. Histopathology results reveal crypt abscesses with a substantial amount of inflammatory cells and debris, which are predominantly neutrophils, although scattered eosinophils can be seen.Management includes prompt discontinuation of capecitabine, although careful consideration of the implications to the treatment of a patient’s underlying cancer and whether suitable alternative agents are available should be determined. Topical budesonide and even systemic steroids have been used in severe cases. Patients generally have full resolution of symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks of discontinuation.The differential diagnosis includes cytomegalovirus (CMV) ileitis, as this is common in patients with immunosuppression. Plasma or whole blood testing for CMV DNA, whether positive or negative, is poorly associated with tissue-invasive enteric CMV infection. A diagnosis of enterically involved CMV infection requires tissue biopsy. Histopathology results typically show the presence of basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies, although eosinophilic inclusion bodies can also be seen.6 Special staining is available for confirmation. No evidence of CMV was seen in this patient. Ileal metastasis in appendiceal adenocarcinoma is quite rare. Appendiceal adenocarcinoma more typically spreads to intraperitoneal lymph nodes or deposits into the peritoneum, causing malignant ascites or peritoneal carcinomatosis. Distant metastasis can also be seen, although other enteric involvement is rare.7 Small-bowel carcinoid and other primary neuroendocrine tumors of the small bowel can cause a syndrome of severe, watery diarrhea with associated crampy lower abdominal pain. These masses can appear on cross-sectional imaging as diffuse and concentric long-segment wall thickening with nearby mesenteric fat stranding, often mimicking radiographic findings of small bowel inflammation.8 Endoscopic findings can vary widely, from a discrete mass to the nonspecific appearance of inflamed tissue or even normal intraluminal appearance. The histopathology results for this patient’s specimens showed no evidence of malignancy.The patient in this case promptly received a diagnosis of capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis and achieved full resolution of symptoms within 2 weeks of budesonide therapy and capecitabine discontinuation. A repeated computed tomography scan less than 3 weeks later (obtained to evaluate cancer response to a transition in therapy) showed no further evidence of ileitis.",Oncology,"A 72-year-old patient with recently diagnosed metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma undergoing chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin presented with lower abdominal pain and watery, large-volume diarrhea up to 15 times per day for the previous 3 weeks.

Most cases of PPP syndrome have been diagnosed in the context of an underlying pancreatic disease that courses with hyperlipasemia.1 Acute and chronic pancreatitis account for more than 50% of cases, whereas neoplastic conditions account for approximately 40%, particularly pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (ACC), but also neuroendocrine or other tumors.1 Alternative etiologies, including pancreatic fistula and trauma have also been reported to lead to PPP syndrome.1In September 2015, the patient underwent gastroduodenopancreatectomy plus splenectomy, and the tumor pathology was consistent with ACC; this procedure resulted in disappearance of PPP syndrome–associated symptoms. One year later, a fever as well as left fist and elbow arthritis developed; an abdominal CT was performed that revealed hepatic metastases.

Notably, lipase-induced tissue lipolysis is the most probable etiologic factor in PPP syndrome, although pancreatic release of amylase and trypsin may also be involved.4 It is postulated that tissue lipolysis and the consequent fat-necrosis–mediated inflammation result in panniculitis, arthritis, pancreatitis, and even intramedullary necrosis.4,5Most patients with PPP syndrome are male, and the median age at diagnosis is 60 years, although this syndrome can affect patients of any age.1 Diagnosis of PPP syndrome is often a challenge, not only because of the heterogeneity of pancreatic diseases that cause this syndrome, but also because patients frequently develop panniculitis or arthritis prior to the appearance of overt clinical pancreatic disease-related symptoms.1 Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed for the diagnosis of PPP syndrome. It is important to note that symptoms associated with ACC are often unrelated to the release of pancreatic enzymes into the circulation. Indeed, patients’ symptoms are usually linked to both local tumor growth and distant metastasis. Overall, PPP syndrome is only acknowledged in about 16% of patients.6The prognosis of patients with ACC is usually dismal. About 77% of patients with ACC will present metastatic disease, and this stage of disease is associated with a median overall survival of 14 to 17 months.6,7 In contrast, patients submitted to complete pancreatic tumor resection had a median overall survival of 36 months.7 As opposed to other pancreatic cancers, potentially treatable BRAF rearrangements and BRCA pathway mutations were recently identified in most patients with ACC.8 However, modulating these potential targets has still not been reported and gemcitabine, FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, and FOLFIRINOX chemotherapeutic regimens are the most frequently used for ACC treatments.9,10 This case demonstrates a progression-free survival of 31 months after the start of FOLFIRINOX therapy for metastatic disease, expands our knowledge, and suggests that FOLFIRINOX is a good therapeutic option for the control of PPP-syndrome–associated symptoms in this rare disease and warrants further multicenter analysis.",Oncology,"A man in his 30s presented with a 3-month history of fourth finger right hand articular heat, pain, redness, and swelling.

Mastocytoma,B,Mastocytoma,"Spine magnetic resonance imaging revealed an unresectable paraspinal mass with neural foramen encroachment and encasement of the aorta (Figure, A). Biopsy findings revealed a monomorphic infiltrate of medium-sized round cells with abundant amphophilic hypogranular cytoplasm (Figure, B), positive for CD117 (also known as KIT), tryptase (serine protease stored in mast cells), and CD2. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated aggregates of more than 15 mast cells, negative for point variation (formerly mutation) of codon 816 on KIT (KIT D816V), with no evidence of an associated hematologic neoplasm, supporting a diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis (SM).Mastocytomas typically present as cutaneous lesions in children and are characterized by a clonal proliferation of morphologically unremarkable mast cells that undergo spontaneous resolution at puberty. Mastocytomas in adults are unusual; extracutaneous presentations are exceedingly rare1,2 and should prompt thorough evaluation for SM.The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for SM3 require the presence of the major criterion (multifocal infiltrates of >15 mast cells in bone marrow or other extracutaneous tissue) and 1 minor criterion, or the presence of 3 minor criteria—atypical morphology of mast cells, KIT D816V variation, mast cells expressing CD25, or elevated serum total tryptase. Systemic mastocytosis is further divided into 5 subvariants ranging from indolent SM to mast cell leukemia. In this patient, the multidisciplinary team agreed that the presence of paraspinal masses encroaching on the spinal cord was sufficient to classify it as aggressive SM (World Health Organization diagnostic criteria requires SM and end-organ damage). Because many patients with SM also present with associated hematologic neoplasms, their prognosis is largely dictated by the associated hematologic neoplasm. A series of 342 patients with SM4 revealed that 12% presented with aggressive SM without an associated hematologic neoplasm. Median survival for these patients was 41 months, with 5% ultimately progressing to leukemia.Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) refers to episodic symptoms (anaphylacticlike) related to mast cell mediator release, largely histamine and prostaglandins. Multiple potential triggers have been described, including manual manipulation (Darier sign), surgery, drugs, and sudden temperature changes. This patient experienced mast cell activation syndrome with severe flushing and gastric distress immediately following abdominal ultrasonography. Ultrasound-induced mast cell degranulation has been reported only in animals,5 and while the mechanism of action is unknown, acoustic agitation of mast cell plasma membranes has been hypothesized.6 Mast cell activation syndrome can be managed with avoidance of triggers and with antimediator therapy, such as H1/H2 blockers, corticosteroids, antileukotrienes, and intramuscular epinephrine for severe cases.Aggressive SM warrants treatment given the risk of organ compromise. Although enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged, systemic therapies with known activity against SM include cladribine,7 midostaurin,8 interferons,7 and imatinib9 (only for patients without KIT D816V variation). Furthermore, nonsurgical localized management of aggressive SM and mastocytomas has been seldom reported in humans and is typically reserved for palliation of local symptoms.1 Disease that is refractory to medical therapies should prompt evaluation for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.10Because of progression of paraspinal disease following treatment with cladribine, midostaurin, and imatinib, the patient in this case underwent palliative spinal radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant consisting of myeloablative total body irradiation (12 Gy in 8 fractions twice daily). Despite our concerns of MCAS in this patient following 2 separate courses of radiotherapy, we have observed that radiotherapy is a poor trigger for MCAS.Three years following allogeneic transplant, the patient was found to have elevated serum tryptase levels in the setting of severe anaphylaxis episodes and confirmation of recurrent SM by bone marrow biopsy. Given his poor prognosis, severe histamine-related symptoms requiring at-home intravenous diphenhydramine infusions, and lack of subsequent treatment options, his death was aided at home per the Oregon Death With Dignity Act, nearly 4 years from diagnosis.",Oncology,"A 41-year-old man presented with a 7-month history of episodes of back and abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and flushing.

Mastocytoma,B,Mastocytoma,"Spine magnetic resonance imaging revealed an unresectable paraspinal mass with neural foramen encroachment and encasement of the aorta (Figure, A). Biopsy findings revealed a monomorphic infiltrate of medium-sized round cells with abundant amphophilic hypogranular cytoplasm (Figure, B), positive for CD117 (also known as KIT), tryptase (serine protease stored in mast cells), and CD2. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated aggregates of more than 15 mast cells, negative for point variation (formerly mutation) of codon 816 on KIT (KIT D816V), with no evidence of an associated hematologic neoplasm, supporting a diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis (SM).Mastocytomas typically present as cutaneous lesions in children and are characterized by a clonal proliferation of morphologically unremarkable mast cells that undergo spontaneous resolution at puberty. Mastocytomas in adults are unusual; extracutaneous presentations are exceedingly rare1,2 and should prompt thorough evaluation for SM.The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for SM3 require the presence of the major criterion (multifocal infiltrates of >15 mast cells in bone marrow or other extracutaneous tissue) and 1 minor criterion, or the presence of 3 minor criteria—atypical morphology of mast cells, KIT D816V variation, mast cells expressing CD25, or elevated serum total tryptase. Systemic mastocytosis is further divided into 5 subvariants ranging from indolent SM to mast cell leukemia. In this patient, the multidisciplinary team agreed that the presence of paraspinal masses encroaching on the spinal cord was sufficient to classify it as aggressive SM (World Health Organization diagnostic criteria requires SM and end-organ damage). Because many patients with SM also present with associated hematologic neoplasms, their prognosis is largely dictated by the associated hematologic neoplasm. A series of 342 patients with SM4 revealed that 12% presented with aggressive SM without an associated hematologic neoplasm. Median survival for these patients was 41 months, with 5% ultimately progressing to leukemia.Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) refers to episodic symptoms (anaphylacticlike) related to mast cell mediator release, largely histamine and prostaglandins. Multiple potential triggers have been described, including manual manipulation (Darier sign), surgery, drugs, and sudden temperature changes. This patient experienced mast cell activation syndrome with severe flushing and gastric distress immediately following abdominal ultrasonography. Ultrasound-induced mast cell degranulation has been reported only in animals,5 and while the mechanism of action is unknown, acoustic agitation of mast cell plasma membranes has been hypothesized.6 Mast cell activation syndrome can be managed with avoidance of triggers and with antimediator therapy, such as H1/H2 blockers, corticosteroids, antileukotrienes, and intramuscular epinephrine for severe cases.Aggressive SM warrants treatment given the risk of organ compromise. Although enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged, systemic therapies with known activity against SM include cladribine,7 midostaurin,8 interferons,7 and imatinib9 (only for patients without KIT D816V variation). Furthermore, nonsurgical localized management of aggressive SM and mastocytomas has been seldom reported in humans and is typically reserved for palliation of local symptoms.1 Disease that is refractory to medical therapies should prompt evaluation for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.10Because of progression of paraspinal disease following treatment with cladribine, midostaurin, and imatinib, the patient in this case underwent palliative spinal radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant consisting of myeloablative total body irradiation (12 Gy in 8 fractions twice daily). Despite our concerns of MCAS in this patient following 2 separate courses of radiotherapy, we have observed that radiotherapy is a poor trigger for MCAS.Three years following allogeneic transplant, the patient was found to have elevated serum tryptase levels in the setting of severe anaphylaxis episodes and confirmation of recurrent SM by bone marrow biopsy.

This entity has a higher incidence in East Asia and Central and South America2 and is frequently associated with EBV, suggesting that EBV may play a role in the pathogenesis of intravascular NKTCL. Although any organ can be involved, the skin and central nervous system are the most likely to be affected. Indurated plaques or nodules (typically on the lower extremities) are the most frequent skin lesions. B symptoms (fever, weight loss, and/or night sweats) are common in patients with intravascular NKTCL.3 The immunophenotypes of the neoplastic cells are positive for NK-cell or NK/T-cell antigens (CD3ε+, CD56+, and cytotoxic markers).4 Because multiple sites were involved in this patient, including the nasal cavity and lymph nodes, it was challenging to distinguish intravascular NKTCL from extranodal NKTCL, nasal type, although the restricted intravascular nature of the lymphoma cells and the chronological occurrence of skin lesions and nasal involvement favored the possibility of multiorgan spreading of intravascular NKTCL. The reason that the neoplastic cells are confined to the blood vessels in intravascular NKTCL remains unknown. Defects in the expression of homing receptors, such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 or integrin β1, have been associated with the intravascular growth pattern of lymphoma cells.5 The prognosis of intravascular NKTCL is poor. Most patients have only a partial and short-term response to conventional chemotherapy.6The main differential diagnosis of intravascular NKTCL is intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) because of its shared clinical and histological features. Intravascular LBCL is a subtype of extranodal LBCL and constitutes most intravascular lymphomas.

Expression of these markers can help rule out metastatic carcinoma, which expresses epithelial markers (cytokeratin). The head and neck area is a common location for cutaneous metastases, but the clinical presentation can vary.Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma often presents clinically as a violaceous plaque or nodule. It can be differentiated histologically based on expression of B-cell markers such as CD19, CD20 and CD79a.4 Merkel cell carcinoma, which commonly presents as a solitary tumor on the head and neck, can be differentiated histologically from AS because of its high association with Polyomaviridae, a double stranded DNA virus present in approximately 80% of Merkel cell carcinomas in the northern hemisphere,5 and expression of neuroendocrine markers.The nuclear transcription factor MYC has recently been characterized as a potential prognostic or therapeutic biomarker that can be used to evaluate AS and differentiate it from other vascular tumors.6 Radiation-associated AS has been shown to have increased MYC expression compared with that of atypical postradiation vascular lesions (eg, benign vascular proliferations in irradiated skin), which do not express MYC.Surgical resection, irradiation, and chemotherapy with paclitaxel are the most common treatments for AS. Surgical margins with at least 2 cm of unaffected skin and soft tissue are recommended, although poor tumor delineation makes negative margins difficult to obtain.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Left ventricular systolic dysfunction,Sarcoidosis,Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy,Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension,C. Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy,C,Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy,"The salient features of this case are the subacute exacerbation of right-sided heart failure and PH, along with ground-glass opacities on computed tomography and genital skin lesions. Pulmonary thromboembolism must be considered, but no evidence of thromboembolism was confirmed on imaging. With this in mind, clinicians must consider alternative causative mechanisms for worsening right-sided heart failure and PH, such as pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) and acute exacerbation of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. For this patient, PTTM is the leading hypothesis, given her skin lesions, lymphadenopathies, and pathological findings compatible with extramammary Paget disease. No evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction was obtained by ultrasonography. Although sarcoidosis can cause PH, her medical history and pathology results were incompatible with this diagnosis.Pulmonary artery wedge sampling could not be performed for this patient because of the unstable, rapidly deteriorating clinical course. Three weeks after admission, her hypoxia became aggravated and she required noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. She died despite treatment, and an autopsy revealed multiple gross metastases of Paget disease, including to the lymph nodes and adrenal glands. In the lungs, a gross metastasis in the right lower lobe and lymphangitis carcinoma were noted. In addition, tumor cell microembolism was identified in small pulmonary arteries and arterioles with fibrocellular and fibromuscular proliferation of the vascular wall (Figure, B).Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy is characterized by widespread tumor cell microemboli, along with fibrocellular and fibromuscular proliferation in the small arteries and arterioles in the lungs. This causes occlusion of the pulmonary vasculature and subsequent PH. Direct hematogenous or lymphatic metastases are suggested to permit cancer cells to enter the venous system via the thoracic duct and pulmonary circulation.1 Cytokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, may play critical roles in the pathogenesis.2 The most common cause of PTTM is gastric adenocarcinoma, followed by lung and breast carcinomas.3 Several reports also identified extramammary Paget disease as a rare entity for PTTM.4Patients with PTTM present with an acute or subacute cor pulmonale.1 This disease progresses rapidly, with a median time from the oxygen supplementation to death of 9 days.3 Although the differential diagnoses remain broad, a combination of progressive dyspnea and normal imaging findings should prompt the immediate consideration of PTTM. For this patient, the genital skin lesions raised the suspicion of skin cancer and PTTM.No specific laboratory or imaging studies exist for making the diagnosis. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or disseminated intravascular coagulation may emerge in the advanced stages.5 Imaging is usually nonspecific but may be appropriate to rule out alternative causes, notably pulmonary thromboembolism. Several cases of PTTM were diagnosed by positron emission tomography–computed tomography scanning,6 but its diagnostic accuracy remains questionable.3 Despite its diagnostic difficulties,7 pathological identification of tumor cells may lead to the antemortem, definitive diagnosis of PTTM and appropriate treatment of underlying malignant conditions. Performing the pulmonary wedge aspiration may be appropriate for patients with severe illness because of its limited invasiveness.Because PTTM has an almost complete case-fatality rate, treatment of underlying malignant conditions is the cornerstone of management.5 Several case reports identified imatinib as a treatment option to increase the survival rate and alleviate pulmonary hypertension associated with PTTM.8This case highlights the importance of considering PTTM as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with a combination of aggravating dyspnea, PH, and normal pulmonary imaging findings. A high index of suspicion allows clinicians to perform both the treatment of the underlying malignant condition and advanced-care planning appropriately.",Oncology,"An 82-year-old patient presented with dyspnea on exertion and weight gain of 5 kg over the past month.

Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts.The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness.On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use What Would You Do Next?",Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use,Commence treatment with oral olanzapine,Commence treatment with oral clozapine,Commence cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis,Schizophrenia,A,Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use,"There are no clear differences in efficacy between licensed antipsychotic medications in head-to-head trials, although network meta-analyses1,2 suggest that clozapine, olanzapine, and amisulpride are among the most efficacious. Note: Amisulpride is approved for use in the United Kingdom where this patient was treated but is not approved for use in the United States. In addition to the short-term efficacy of antipsychotic medication, there is also evidence that maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs lowers the risk of relapse.3In addition to efficacy, the risk of adverse effects should be carefully considered when discussing treatment options (choice A). The patient in this clinical challenge is of African origin and had overweight, both of which increase the likelihood of adverse metabolic effects developing during antipsychotic treatment.4 Furthermore, psychosis itself is associated with an increased risk of metabolic dysfunction.5 Consequently, if efficacy and other risks of adverse effects are equal, treatments with a high risk of adverse metabolic effects, such as olanzapine (choice B), should be avoided if possible. Alternatives to amisulpride with relatively low levels of adverse metabolic effects include haloperidol and aripiprazole.Although clozapine (choice C) has demonstrated superiority compared with other antipsychotic medications, this has not been established for patients experiencing first episodes of psychosis, and it has a high burden of adverse effects and requires regular monitoring of full blood cell counts because of the risk of agranulocytosis. As a result, it is typically not recommended as a first-line treatment. It is, however, the only drug licensed for treatment resistance, and evidence indicates that early use in patients with treatment resistance leads to better outcomes.6Long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications are an underused treatment option and should be considered early in the illness course.7 However, even if a long-acting injectable drug is to be used from the first episode, it is generally preferable to first start with oral medication to allow an estimation of dosage and accommodate the time a drug takes to reach effective plasma levels.8The patient’s mental health team specialized in the management of first-episode psychosis, and dedicated early-intervention services are associated with considerable benefits for the individual patient and also their family.9 These teams provide social and psychological support in addition to pharmacological treatments. Cognitive behavioral therapy (choice D) does not have clear evidence of efficacy when given as a stand-alone treatment, but it shows benefit when given in combination with an antipsychotic drug.10Oral amisulpride in a dosage of 200 mg, twice daily, was prescribed initially (amisulpride is approved for use in the United Kingdom where the patient was treated). At a review 2 weeks later, although auditory hallucinations had reduced in intensity, the patient’s paranoid delusions persisted. She reported good medication concordance, and this was corroborated by the family. The dosage was therefore increased to 400 mg, twice daily, and cognitive behavioral therapy was also commenced. The patient complained of some stiffness, which improved when the morning dosage was reduced back to 200 mg, twice daily. The psychotic symptoms gradually resolved over the next 4 weeks, although she remained socially withdrawn. Her mother was supportive but became increasingly frustrated about her lack of activity and failure to get a new job, and she frequently criticized her for this. Six months after commencing amisulpride, the patient’s positive symptoms returned, and after concerns regarding weight loss secondary to reduced food and fluid intake, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Antipsychotic plasma levels at the time of admission suggested poor compliance with antipsychotic treatment. After discussing this with the patient, she reported finding it difficult to remember to take the treatment regularly, although her family also stated that she had reported to them that she did not feel the need to continue taking her medication. After considering the options, she elected to try treatment with a long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone to avoid the need to remember to take pills.

Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use What Would You Do Next?",Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use,Commence treatment with oral olanzapine,Commence treatment with oral clozapine,Commence cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis,Schizophrenia,A,Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use,"There are no clear differences in efficacy between licensed antipsychotic medications in head-to-head trials, although network meta-analyses1,2 suggest that clozapine, olanzapine, and amisulpride are among the most efficacious. Note: Amisulpride is approved for use in the United Kingdom where this patient was treated but is not approved for use in the United States. In addition to the short-term efficacy of antipsychotic medication, there is also evidence that maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs lowers the risk of relapse.3In addition to efficacy, the risk of adverse effects should be carefully considered when discussing treatment options (choice A). The patient in this clinical challenge is of African origin and had overweight, both of which increase the likelihood of adverse metabolic effects developing during antipsychotic treatment.4 Furthermore, psychosis itself is associated with an increased risk of metabolic dysfunction.5 Consequently, if efficacy and other risks of adverse effects are equal, treatments with a high risk of adverse metabolic effects, such as olanzapine (choice B), should be avoided if possible. Alternatives to amisulpride with relatively low levels of adverse metabolic effects include haloperidol and aripiprazole.Although clozapine (choice C) has demonstrated superiority compared with other antipsychotic medications, this has not been established for patients experiencing first episodes of psychosis, and it has a high burden of adverse effects and requires regular monitoring of full blood cell counts because of the risk of agranulocytosis. As a result, it is typically not recommended as a first-line treatment. It is, however, the only drug licensed for treatment resistance, and evidence indicates that early use in patients with treatment resistance leads to better outcomes.6Long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications are an underused treatment option and should be considered early in the illness course.7 However, even if a long-acting injectable drug is to be used from the first episode, it is generally preferable to first start with oral medication to allow an estimation of dosage and accommodate the time a drug takes to reach effective plasma levels.8The patient’s mental health team specialized in the management of first-episode psychosis, and dedicated early-intervention services are associated with considerable benefits for the individual patient and also their family.9 These teams provide social and psychological support in addition to pharmacological treatments. Cognitive behavioral therapy (choice D) does not have clear evidence of efficacy when given as a stand-alone treatment, but it shows benefit when given in combination with an antipsychotic drug.10Oral amisulpride in a dosage of 200 mg, twice daily, was prescribed initially (amisulpride is approved for use in the United Kingdom where the patient was treated). At a review 2 weeks later, although auditory hallucinations had reduced in intensity, the patient’s paranoid delusions persisted. She reported good medication concordance, and this was corroborated by the family. The dosage was therefore increased to 400 mg, twice daily, and cognitive behavioral therapy was also commenced. The patient complained of some stiffness, which improved when the morning dosage was reduced back to 200 mg, twice daily. The psychotic symptoms gradually resolved over the next 4 weeks, although she remained socially withdrawn. Her mother was supportive but became increasingly frustrated about her lack of activity and failure to get a new job, and she frequently criticized her for this. Six months after commencing amisulpride, the patient’s positive symptoms returned, and after concerns regarding weight loss secondary to reduced food and fluid intake, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Antipsychotic plasma levels at the time of admission suggested poor compliance with antipsychotic treatment. After discussing this with the patient, she reported finding it difficult to remember to take the treatment regularly, although her family also stated that she had reported to them that she did not feel the need to continue taking her medication. After considering the options, she elected to try treatment with a long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone to avoid the need to remember to take pills. This was started after trying the oral form for a week to check that it suited her.",Psychiatry,"A 20-year-old patient was referred by them family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Them mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of them father. After a period living alone, they had returned to the family home 4 months prior to them presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Them family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Them family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to themselves, expressing concerns about people meaning them harm, and professing the belief that they could hear other peoples’ thoughts.The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with them family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, them family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, they had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. They left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. They left this job about a year prior to them referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of them father. They was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Bone-marrow biopsy results (Figure, C and D) showed hypercellular marrow with a diffuse interstitial infiltrate of large, centroblasticlike lymphoid cells and no features suggestive of plasmacytic or secretory differentiation. These cells were CD20+, CD5−, and CD30− and accounted for approximately 60% of the global cellularity. The large B cells were CD10−, BCL6+, and MUM-1+, a non-germinal center–like phenotype according to the Hans algorithm. Furthermore, B cells were BCL2+ and negative for MYC expression, and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed no rearrangements of the BCL2, BCL6, or MYC genes. Although immunostains for κ and λ light chains highlighted a small population of reactive plasma cells distributed in the marrow spaces, they did not produce specific staining in the lymphoma cells. Residual trilinear hematopoiesis was reduced, with no excess of blasts, and no evidence was found to support a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The lymphoma cells were negative for Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus 8.The diagnosis was consistent with the bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma (BLS-type LBCL).1 This subtype of diffuse LBCL (DLBCL) includes bone-marrow involvement with or without involvement of the liver or spleen and is often accompanied by severe anemia (100%), thrombocytopenia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (64%), and elevated LDH levels in the absence of lymphadenopathy, other extranodal masses, or a lymphoma history.1Primary bone-marrow lymphoma is restricted to patients with isolated bone-marrow involvement, but this patient also had splenomegaly. Intravascular LBCL may be diagnosed in bone-marrow specimens, but the lymphoma cells were diffusely distributed in the bone-marrow spaces and did not show a distribution restricted to the lumens of small vessels and sinusoids. T-cell/histiocyte-rich LBCL is a rare type of LBCL and commonly involves the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. In this patient, the T-cell/histiocyte-rich background was missing. A multifocal primary lymphoma of the bone was excluded in the absence of bone lesions.The bone marrow is an unusual site to establish the diagnosis of DLBCL, which typically presents with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes or extranodal masses; secondary bone-marrow involvement occurs in approximately 10% to 16% of patients with DLBCL, not otherwise specified.2,3 Bone marrow–liver–spleen LBCL could be considered an aggressive variant of primary splenic DLBCL that has spread into the bone marrow. However, primary splenic DLBCL usually presents with large splenic masses, or less often as diffuse leukemialike infiltration in the red pulpa,4 and is rarely associated with hemophagocytic syndrome.5 To our knowledge, few cases of BLS-type LBCL have been described. This aggressive lymphoma is characterized by severe clinical presentation and rapid evolution with high mortality and no specific infectious or genetic abnormality.6To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of long-lasting, paraneoplastic-refractory pleuropericarditis associated with BLS-type LBCL. The differential diagnosis of pleuropericarditis is large, including infectious causes, autoimmune and metabolic disorders, chemotherapy or radiation toxic effects, and neoplastic or paraneoplastic conditions. It is most often idiopathic (85%-90%), and only 7% of cases are described as neoplastic or paraneoplastic.7 Pericardial disease as the first manifestation of malignant neoplasm is uncommon and makes diagnosis difficult. In a retrospective study of patients with symptomatic pericardial effusion,8 newly diagnosed cancer accounted for the symptoms in one-fifth of the patients with initially uninformative basic workups. Furthermore, idiopathic inflammatory, refractory pleuropericarditis is often a challenging diagnosis, and malignant neoplasm should be ruled out. When studying the association of acute pericardial disease with malignant neoplasm, Imazio et al8 found an association of the lack of response of pericarditis to steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and an incessant or recurrent course of pericarditis with the presence of a neoplastic cause of the pericardial disease.In this patient, the initial manifestation of probable paraneoplastic recurrent pleuropericarditis with the absence of lymph node involvement and pancytopenia for more than 3 years made the diagnosis challenging to achieve with an ordinary CT scanner.

The large B cells were CD10−, BCL6+, and MUM-1+, a non-germinal center–like phenotype according to the Hans algorithm. Furthermore, B cells were BCL2+ and negative for MYC expression, and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed no rearrangements of the BCL2, BCL6, or MYC genes. Although immunostains for κ and λ light chains highlighted a small population of reactive plasma cells distributed in the marrow spaces, they did not produce specific staining in the lymphoma cells. Residual trilinear hematopoiesis was reduced, with no excess of blasts, and no evidence was found to support a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The lymphoma cells were negative for Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus 8.The diagnosis was consistent with the bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma (BLS-type LBCL).1 This subtype of diffuse LBCL (DLBCL) includes bone-marrow involvement with or without involvement of the liver or spleen and is often accompanied by severe anemia (100%), thrombocytopenia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (64%), and elevated LDH levels in the absence of lymphadenopathy, other extranodal masses, or a lymphoma history.1Primary bone-marrow lymphoma is restricted to patients with isolated bone-marrow involvement, but this patient also had splenomegaly. Intravascular LBCL may be diagnosed in bone-marrow specimens, but the lymphoma cells were diffusely distributed in the bone-marrow spaces and did not show a distribution restricted to the lumens of small vessels and sinusoids. T-cell/histiocyte-rich LBCL is a rare type of LBCL and commonly involves the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. In this patient, the T-cell/histiocyte-rich background was missing. A multifocal primary lymphoma of the bone was excluded in the absence of bone lesions.The bone marrow is an unusual site to establish the diagnosis of DLBCL, which typically presents with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes or extranodal masses; secondary bone-marrow involvement occurs in approximately 10% to 16% of patients with DLBCL, not otherwise specified.2,3 Bone marrow–liver–spleen LBCL could be considered an aggressive variant of primary splenic DLBCL that has spread into the bone marrow. However, primary splenic DLBCL usually presents with large splenic masses, or less often as diffuse leukemialike infiltration in the red pulpa,4 and is rarely associated with hemophagocytic syndrome.5 To our knowledge, few cases of BLS-type LBCL have been described. This aggressive lymphoma is characterized by severe clinical presentation and rapid evolution with high mortality and no specific infectious or genetic abnormality.6To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of long-lasting, paraneoplastic-refractory pleuropericarditis associated with BLS-type LBCL. The differential diagnosis of pleuropericarditis is large, including infectious causes, autoimmune and metabolic disorders, chemotherapy or radiation toxic effects, and neoplastic or paraneoplastic conditions. It is most often idiopathic (85%-90%), and only 7% of cases are described as neoplastic or paraneoplastic.7 Pericardial disease as the first manifestation of malignant neoplasm is uncommon and makes diagnosis difficult. In a retrospective study of patients with symptomatic pericardial effusion,8 newly diagnosed cancer accounted for the symptoms in one-fifth of the patients with initially uninformative basic workups. Furthermore, idiopathic inflammatory, refractory pleuropericarditis is often a challenging diagnosis, and malignant neoplasm should be ruled out. When studying the association of acute pericardial disease with malignant neoplasm, Imazio et al8 found an association of the lack of response of pericarditis to steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and an incessant or recurrent course of pericarditis with the presence of a neoplastic cause of the pericardial disease.In this patient, the initial manifestation of probable paraneoplastic recurrent pleuropericarditis with the absence of lymph node involvement and pancytopenia for more than 3 years made the diagnosis challenging to achieve with an ordinary CT scanner. This case illustrates the growing interest in PET-CT and bone-marrow biopsies in the assessment of idiopathic recurrent pleuropericarditis.",Oncology,"A 71-year-old patient had a 3-year history of a recurrent seronegative autoimmune constrictive pericarditis and pleural effusions, which were treated with pericardiectomy and prednisone and azathioprine. The pleural fluid was transudative and sterile, and the pericardium contained focal lymphoplasmacytic aggregates. Attempts to taper immunosuppressive drugs failed because of a recrudescence of the inflammatory syndrome and pericardial effusion. The patient was admitted with fever of unknown origin with a surge of the inflammatory syndrome and pancytopenia. They reported night sweats beginning 3 weeks prior associated with fever and unintentional weight loss. No lymphadenopathy was noted.Laboratory evaluations demonstrated a C-reactive protein level of 133 mg/L (reference range, <10 mg/L); ferritin level of 2607 ng/mL (reference, 30-300 ng/mL); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 289 U/L (reference, 135-214 U/L); pancytopenia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL (reference, 13.3-17.7 g/dL), white blood cell count of 2700/μL (reference, 4000-10 000/μL), and platelet count of 99 ×103/μL (reference, 150-350 ×103/μL); and prerenal acute kidney injury (Acute Kidney Injury Network stage 1) with a serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL (reference, 0.7-1.2 mg/dL). Results of a comprehensive serologic workup were negative. Gastroscopy results showed mycotic distal esophagitis.The patient was readmitted 3 weeks later with fever and hypotension without improvement despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. Considering the increase in ferritin and LDH levels and pancytopenia, a hematologic disease was suspected. The patient did not report any bone pain. Computed tomography (CT) results showed a splenomegaly without evidence of metastatic disease or lymph node enlargement. Positron emission tomography (PET)–CT imaging (Figure, A and B) and a bone-marrow biopsy (Figure, C and D) were performed. A rapidly evolving sepsislike syndrome led to the patient’s death.Fluorodeoxyglucose/positron emission tomography–computed tomography imaging results show diffuse hypercaptation in the bone marrow (A) and spleen (B).

Of these malignant neoplasms, subungual SCC is the most frequent.1-4 Subungual SCC has been considered a low-grade malignant neoplasm with a good prognosis compared with SCC arising elsewhere.2-4 About 20% of patients with subungual SCC have bony invasion, and metastasis and lymph node involvement is uncommon.1-4 Usually, the patients tend to be men aged 50 to 79 years, and typically, a single digit, especially the thumb or hallux, is likely to be involved.1-3The origin of subungual SCC has not been well described. However, some causative factors have been proposed, including trauma, dyskeratosis congenita, sun exposure, radiation exposure, chemical exposure (ie, tar, arsenic, or exposure to minerals), immunosuppression, chronic infection, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially HPV 16 infection.1-3,5,6The indolent natural history and the variable clinical manifestations of subungual SCC often lead to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis and, subsequently, poor prognosis. Therefore, the differential diagnosis is very important and should include subungual keratoacanthoma, verruca vulgaris, exostosis, onychomycosis, and chronic paronychia. Subungual keratoacanthoma, is a benign tumor that usually presents as a painful, locally aggressive, and rapidly growing mass with a well-defined osteolytic destruction of the underlying bone.7,8 Although the histologic appearance and clinical presentation of subungual keratoacanthoma is sometimes indistinguishable from subungual SCC, the diagnosis in the present case was definitive given the patient’s 7-year medical history and the histologic results, which supported the diagnosis of subungual SCC. Verruca vulgaris, especially a subungual wart, can be confused with subungual SCC because of the similar appearance; however, the histopathologic findings revealed the appearance of subungual SCC, and HPV was not detected in the neoplastic squamous cells. Another important differential diagnosis is subungual exostosis, a benign osteocartilaginous tumor that appears as a wartlike nodule under the nail with onycholysis and nail plate destruction. However, subungual exostosis often occurs in children and young adults, with a radiograph revealing a calcifying projection on the distal phalanx, and the pathologic results showing mature trabecular bone.9 Chronic paronychia and onychomycosis also should be ruled out. However, chronic paronychia often affects the proximal and lateral nail folds, presenting as a red, tender, and swelling lesion with the absence of cuticle and onychodystrophy, which is not consistent with the clinical appearance in the present case. Furthermore, complete blood cell count results and mycological and bacteriologic examinations were unremarkable in the present case. Distal subungual onychomycosis, defined as a fungal infection, usually manifests as dystrophic, thick nails with onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and discoloration; although there are some similarities in the clinical appearances of onychomycosis and SCC, the unremarkable mycological examination was the most convincing evidence to exclude onychomycosis.A tissue biopsy should be performed for a definitive diagnosis and requires a high degree of suspicion. In the present case, hematoxylin-eosin staining of the initial biopsy specimen showed proliferation of atypical squamous cells invading the dermis on low power (magnification ×60) (Figure, B). Higher-power images (magnification ×100) showed large atypical neoplastic squamous cells with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic, and atypical mitosis (Figure, C).

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Erosive osteoarthritis,Metastatic bone disease,Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis,Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis,C. Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis,C,Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis,"Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells and blocks the interaction with programed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2, resulting in T-cell activation and proliferation.1 The enhanced immune response associated with nivolumab improves antitumor immunity; however, it is also associated with various immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Based on pooled data from clinical trials of nivolumab, the most common irAE was skin related. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, and endocrine systems were among the other systems that were affected.1Inflammatory arthritis is a reported irAE associated with nivolumab, with a prevalence of approximately 2%.2 Most patients (65%) present with polyarticular inflammatory arthritis with involvement of small and/or large joints.2 Many of these patients do not develop autoantibodies like rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated peptide antibody and are thus seronegative. In a cohort of 9 patients who developed arthritis during nivolumab therapy, 5 patients progressed to polyarticular arthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis, without any evidence of autoantibodies or notable bone erosions. These patients required a much higher dose of systemic steroids than those without polyarticular arthritis, and the arthritis persisted for several months after stopping nivolumab.3 In another case series, the authors described patients who developed seropositive rheumatoid arthritis shortly after receiving nivolumab, raising the concern that nivolumab may unmask underlying autoimmunity.4 In 1 report, a patient developed deforming arthritis during nivolumab therapy; however, imaging did not reveal erosions or joint damage.5The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends a high index of suspicion for irAEs with any new symptoms after initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).6 Timely referral to a rheumatologist is recommended. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy may be continued with close monitoring for grade 1 toxic effects except in the setting of some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxic effects. However, ICIs should be withheld in patients with grade 2 or higher toxic effects, and systemic corticosteroid therapy should be added, with a slow taper as needed. In patients who are unable to taper prednisone, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs may be offered, with methotrexate, leflunomide, or a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor as potential options.6There may be some concern about whether steroids affect the efficacy of ICIs;7 however, in a large cohort study in which steroids were used to treat irAEs, steroid use did not appear to affect progression-free survival.8 Conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (eg, methotrexate) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors used for ICI-related irAEs also did not appear to affect the overall response rate or survival outcome.9,10 These studies are reassuring and suggest that early and appropriate management of arthritis may be possible without affecting the antitumor response of ICIs.Herein, we describe a patient with partially treated, seronegative inflammatory erosive arthritis that developed after the use of nivolumab. This is the first case, to our knowledge, of inflammatory arthritis associated with nivolumab that led to profound, irreversible joint damage. In this patient, nivolumab was continued for a year despite the ongoing inflammatory arthritis, which was partially treated.In the setting of inflammatory arthritis associated with ICIs, if the arthritis is not adequately treated, it could lead to erosive and deforming arthritis, underscoring the need for early recognition and appropriate management to prevent such deforming joint damage. Persistent subclinical inflammation was evident on magnetic resonance imaging even after discontinuation of nivolumab therapy. We recommend having a thorough discussion with patients about the potential risks vs benefits of various antirheumatic drugs for adequate treatment of arthritis to prevent significant joint damage, long-term morbidity, and implications for antitumor response.",Oncology,"A 58-year-old white woman with history of metastatic human papillomavirus–positive cervical adenocarcinoma presented with multiple joint deformities.

Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis,C,Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis,"Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells and blocks the interaction with programed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2, resulting in T-cell activation and proliferation.1 The enhanced immune response associated with nivolumab improves antitumor immunity; however, it is also associated with various immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Based on pooled data from clinical trials of nivolumab, the most common irAE was skin related. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, and endocrine systems were among the other systems that were affected.1Inflammatory arthritis is a reported irAE associated with nivolumab, with a prevalence of approximately 2%.2 Most patients (65%) present with polyarticular inflammatory arthritis with involvement of small and/or large joints.2 Many of these patients do not develop autoantibodies like rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated peptide antibody and are thus seronegative. In a cohort of 9 patients who developed arthritis during nivolumab therapy, 5 patients progressed to polyarticular arthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis, without any evidence of autoantibodies or notable bone erosions. These patients required a much higher dose of systemic steroids than those without polyarticular arthritis, and the arthritis persisted for several months after stopping nivolumab.3 In another case series, the authors described patients who developed seropositive rheumatoid arthritis shortly after receiving nivolumab, raising the concern that nivolumab may unmask underlying autoimmunity.4 In 1 report, a patient developed deforming arthritis during nivolumab therapy; however, imaging did not reveal erosions or joint damage.5The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends a high index of suspicion for irAEs with any new symptoms after initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).6 Timely referral to a rheumatologist is recommended. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy may be continued with close monitoring for grade 1 toxic effects except in the setting of some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxic effects. However, ICIs should be withheld in patients with grade 2 or higher toxic effects, and systemic corticosteroid therapy should be added, with a slow taper as needed. In patients who are unable to taper prednisone, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs may be offered, with methotrexate, leflunomide, or a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor as potential options.6There may be some concern about whether steroids affect the efficacy of ICIs;7 however, in a large cohort study in which steroids were used to treat irAEs, steroid use did not appear to affect progression-free survival.8 Conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (eg, methotrexate) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors used for ICI-related irAEs also did not appear to affect the overall response rate or survival outcome.9,10 These studies are reassuring and suggest that early and appropriate management of arthritis may be possible without affecting the antitumor response of ICIs.Herein, we describe a patient with partially treated, seronegative inflammatory erosive arthritis that developed after the use of nivolumab.

Myopathic action potentials were not present. A chest computed tomographic scan ruled out the presence of a thymoma. What Is Your Diagnosis?",Guillain-Barré syndrome,Lambert-Eaton syndrome,Miller Fisher syndrome,Myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome,D. Myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome,D,Myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune condition caused by autoantibodies targeting acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction. There are 2 clinical forms of MG. Ocular MG presents with fluctuating ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and diplopia. Generalized MG can also affect extraocular muscles but is characterized by proximal muscle weakness that worsens with muscle use. Although all the conditions in the differential diagnosis have been reported as adverse effects of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, the combination of ophthalmoparesis, ptosis, acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-Abs), and abnormal jitter on single-fiber electromyography is characteristic of MG.1-3 Lambert-Eaton syndrome also presents with weakness, but it typically improves with muscle use and is caused by antibodies against presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Miller Fisher syndrome is caused by autoantibodies against GQ1b, a ganglioside found in nerves. Guillain-Barré syndrome typically presents with ascending weakness and diminished deep tendon reflexes.The overall incidence of neurological adverse effects after ICI therapy is 3.8% with anti–cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 treatment and 6.1% with anti–programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) treatment.4 Myasthenia gravis is a relatively common neuromuscular adverse effect of ICIs across chemotherapy regimens and tumor types. Other common neurological complications include demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies, vasculitic neuropathies, isolated cranial neuropathies, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, and hypophysitis.5 Although the pathophysiology of ICI-induced MG has not been elucidated, some general mechanisms have been proposed for the immune adverse effects of ICI: (1) increased autoantibody production to normal cells and receptors (eg, AChR), (2) activated T cells recognizing antigens similar to tumor antigen in normal tissue, (3) increased proinflammatory cytokine levels, and (4) ICI monoclonal antibodies binding normal cells (eg, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4), triggering complement-mediated injury.6 Alterations in the Treg/Th17 axis and B cells populations may also be involved in autoimmune condition development.5,7 Interestingly, both exacerbations of previously diagnosed MG and de novo cases have been reported.8 Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced MG can also present simultaneously with other conditions such as myositis and myocarditis, with the frequency of concurrent myositis reported to be as high as 39%.8A recent review reported that ICI-induced MG-specific mortality was 30.4%, making early recognition of ICI toxic effects critical.8 Clinical suspicion for MG should be high for patients on immunotherapy who develop diplopia or proximal muscle weakness. The average onset of myasthenic symptoms is 5.59 weeks after treatment initiation, with a range of 2 to 12 weeks.8 Although 80% of the overall MG patient population has tested positive for AChR-Abs, only one-half to two-thirds of patients with ICI-induced MG are AChR-Ab positive.3,8,9 To our knowledge, no cases of ICI-induced MG in patients with muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies have been reported.3,8 Finally, single-fiber electromyography is 98% sensitive for MG but is not pathognomonic.10After diagnosis of MG, checkpoint inhibitors should be discontinued and immunosuppressive therapy initiated. Treatment options include corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin. Cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, pyridostigmine) are ineffective as monotherapy but can be used with immunosuppressants to lower immunosuppressant dose and reduce adverse effects. Although the incidence of thymoma in ICI-induced MG is low, a thymectomy should be considered if present.8The patient’s nivolumab and cabozantinib were withheld. He was initially administered a 20-mg dose of prednisone daily and received 2 g of intravenous immunoglobulin over 5 days. A trial of pyridostigmine was not beneficial and was discontinued. Within 5 days, the diplopia improved and the creatine kinase levels decreased to 565 U/L (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Dexamethasone was gradually increased to 40 mg daily, and symptoms resolved 9 weeks after presentation.

Workup revealed elevated creatine kinase (1222 U/L; reference range, 24-195 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]), aldolase (24.5 U/L; reference range, <8.1 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]), and C-reactive protein levels (106 mg/L; reference range, <5 mg/L [to convert to nmol/L, multiply by 9.524]).Acetylcholine receptor binding and modulating antibody levels were elevated (0.69 nmol/L [reference range, <0.3 nmol/L] and 48% [reference range, 0%-20%], respectively). Results of the striated muscle antibody titer were also abnormal (1:160; reference range, <1:40). Blood test results were negative for acetylcholine receptor blocking and muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies. Nerve conduction studies showed a normal response to repetitive nerve stimulation. Single-fiber electromyography was pathologic and revealed an abnormal mean consecutive difference in more than 50% of the tested pairs (Figure, B), and no blocking was seen. Myopathic action potentials were not present. A chest computed tomographic scan ruled out the presence of a thymoma.

Myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome,D,Myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune condition caused by autoantibodies targeting acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction. There are 2 clinical forms of MG. Ocular MG presents with fluctuating ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and diplopia. Generalized MG can also affect extraocular muscles but is characterized by proximal muscle weakness that worsens with muscle use. Although all the conditions in the differential diagnosis have been reported as adverse effects of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, the combination of ophthalmoparesis, ptosis, acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-Abs), and abnormal jitter on single-fiber electromyography is characteristic of MG.1-3 Lambert-Eaton syndrome also presents with weakness, but it typically improves with muscle use and is caused by antibodies against presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Miller Fisher syndrome is caused by autoantibodies against GQ1b, a ganglioside found in nerves. Guillain-Barré syndrome typically presents with ascending weakness and diminished deep tendon reflexes.The overall incidence of neurological adverse effects after ICI therapy is 3.8% with anti–cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 treatment and 6.1% with anti–programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) treatment.4 Myasthenia gravis is a relatively common neuromuscular adverse effect of ICIs across chemotherapy regimens and tumor types. Other common neurological complications include demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies, vasculitic neuropathies, isolated cranial neuropathies, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, and hypophysitis.5 Although the pathophysiology of ICI-induced MG has not been elucidated, some general mechanisms have been proposed for the immune adverse effects of ICI: (1) increased autoantibody production to normal cells and receptors (eg, AChR), (2) activated T cells recognizing antigens similar to tumor antigen in normal tissue, (3) increased proinflammatory cytokine levels, and (4) ICI monoclonal antibodies binding normal cells (eg, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4), triggering complement-mediated injury.6 Alterations in the Treg/Th17 axis and B cells populations may also be involved in autoimmune condition development.5,7 Interestingly, both exacerbations of previously diagnosed MG and de novo cases have been reported.8 Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced MG can also present simultaneously with other conditions such as myositis and myocarditis, with the frequency of concurrent myositis reported to be as high as 39%.8A recent review reported that ICI-induced MG-specific mortality was 30.4%, making early recognition of ICI toxic effects critical.8 Clinical suspicion for MG should be high for patients on immunotherapy who develop diplopia or proximal muscle weakness. The average onset of myasthenic symptoms is 5.59 weeks after treatment initiation, with a range of 2 to 12 weeks.8 Although 80% of the overall MG patient population has tested positive for AChR-Abs, only one-half to two-thirds of patients with ICI-induced MG are AChR-Ab positive.3,8,9 To our knowledge, no cases of ICI-induced MG in patients with muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies have been reported.3,8 Finally, single-fiber electromyography is 98% sensitive for MG but is not pathognomonic.10After diagnosis of MG, checkpoint inhibitors should be discontinued and immunosuppressive therapy initiated. Treatment options include corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin. Cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, pyridostigmine) are ineffective as monotherapy but can be used with immunosuppressants to lower immunosuppressant dose and reduce adverse effects. Although the incidence of thymoma in ICI-induced MG is low, a thymectomy should be considered if present.8The patient’s nivolumab and cabozantinib were withheld. He was initially administered a 20-mg dose of prednisone daily and received 2 g of intravenous immunoglobulin over 5 days. A trial of pyridostigmine was not beneficial and was discontinued. Within 5 days, the diplopia improved and the creatine kinase levels decreased to 565 U/L (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Dexamethasone was gradually increased to 40 mg daily, and symptoms resolved 9 weeks after presentation. The tumor did not respond to neoadjuvant therapy and remained locally advanced, so he was referred for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization of the hepatic tumor.",Oncology,"A 59-year-old patient with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was found to have a 12.4-cm liver mass, with imaging characteristics concerning for malignant neoplasm (Figure, A).

He began pembrolizumab therapy.After starting treatment, the patient began to notice slowly worsening painless, nonpruritic, diffuse dark gray skin, nail beds, and eye discoloration (Figure). The results of laboratory studies revealed normal electrolytes, normal kidney function, mild elevation of liver function, and mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL (for SI unit conversion, multiply by 10.0 to convert to liters). Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed worsening hepatic metastases and right axillary adenopathy. What Is Your Diagnosis?",Hemochromatosis,Diffuse melanosis cutis,Addison disease,Hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure,B. Diffuse melanosis cutis,B,Diffuse melanosis cutis,"Diffuse melanosis cutis (DMC) is a rare condition characterized by the hyperpigmentation of skin and mucous membranes caused by increased melanin deposition in patients with malignant melanoma. According to a systematic review,1 fewer than 100 cases have been reported. Diffuse melanosis cutis presents more commonly in males (60% of cases) and white patients (95% of cases), with a median age at the time of diagnosis of about 50 years.1 This condition is also associated with melanuria in about 77% of cases.1 Usually, DMC is seen 12 months after an initial diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. Patients present with progressive and diffuse blue-gray hyperpigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, leading to darkening of the skin, hair, peritoneal fluid, sputum, urine, and sometimes the internal organs.2Histopathologic findings include deposition of perivascular histiocytes filled with melanin and free pigment in the dermal connective tissue. The underlying pathogenesis for this condition is not fully understood. According to one hypothesis, when metastatic melanoma undergoes lysis by ischemia, immunological responses, or oncologic treatments, cells release melanin precursors into the bloodstream that undergo auto-oxidation, become ingested by histiocytes, and are then deposited in the dermis.3 Another hypothesis suggests that tumor cells release melanocyte peptide growth factors such as α melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which might be responsible for DMC. The role immunotherapy played in the manifestation of DMC in this case is unclear. One case series of patients who developed DMC after immunotherapy initiation concluded that DMC may be a negative predictor of response to anti–PD-1 (programmed cell death 1) treatment.4 In particular, it remains unclear whether immunotherapy promotes DMC development or just cannot control DMC that would inevitably develop.The discoloration of DMC is most prominently noted in sun-exposed areas, progressing in a cephalocaudal direction.2 Diffuse melanosis cutis is an ominous sign that is associated with a worse prognosis, with a median survival of 4 to 6 months after diagnosis.1,5 According to case reports,5,6 novel therapies that target a BRAF mutation and immunotherapies have shown a considerable survival benefit.Based on the results of the biopsy specimen, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma. Metastatic melanoma should be one of the differential diagnoses in patients presenting with unusual skin discoloration and/or dark-colored bodily secretions. Given this patient’s short survival after his initial presentation, prognosis should be discussed at the time of diagnosis. Other differential diagnoses include hemochromatosis, most notably the hereditary form, which demonstrates skin hyperpigmentation in most cases. Elevated liver function levels are more likely related to worsening hepatic metastases. In this case, hemochromatosis is less likely given the patient’s unremarkable family history and the absence of other clinical features of hemochromatosis, including arthropathy or diabetes.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Hemochromatosis,Diffuse melanosis cutis,Addison disease,Hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure,B. Diffuse melanosis cutis,B,Diffuse melanosis cutis,"Diffuse melanosis cutis (DMC) is a rare condition characterized by the hyperpigmentation of skin and mucous membranes caused by increased melanin deposition in patients with malignant melanoma. According to a systematic review,1 fewer than 100 cases have been reported. Diffuse melanosis cutis presents more commonly in males (60% of cases) and white patients (95% of cases), with a median age at the time of diagnosis of about 50 years.1 This condition is also associated with melanuria in about 77% of cases.1 Usually, DMC is seen 12 months after an initial diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. Patients present with progressive and diffuse blue-gray hyperpigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, leading to darkening of the skin, hair, peritoneal fluid, sputum, urine, and sometimes the internal organs.2Histopathologic findings include deposition of perivascular histiocytes filled with melanin and free pigment in the dermal connective tissue. The underlying pathogenesis for this condition is not fully understood. According to one hypothesis, when metastatic melanoma undergoes lysis by ischemia, immunological responses, or oncologic treatments, cells release melanin precursors into the bloodstream that undergo auto-oxidation, become ingested by histiocytes, and are then deposited in the dermis.3 Another hypothesis suggests that tumor cells release melanocyte peptide growth factors such as α melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which might be responsible for DMC. The role immunotherapy played in the manifestation of DMC in this case is unclear. One case series of patients who developed DMC after immunotherapy initiation concluded that DMC may be a negative predictor of response to anti–PD-1 (programmed cell death 1) treatment.4 In particular, it remains unclear whether immunotherapy promotes DMC development or just cannot control DMC that would inevitably develop.The discoloration of DMC is most prominently noted in sun-exposed areas, progressing in a cephalocaudal direction.2 Diffuse melanosis cutis is an ominous sign that is associated with a worse prognosis, with a median survival of 4 to 6 months after diagnosis.1,5 According to case reports,5,6 novel therapies that target a BRAF mutation and immunotherapies have shown a considerable survival benefit.Based on the results of the biopsy specimen, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma. Metastatic melanoma should be one of the differential diagnoses in patients presenting with unusual skin discoloration and/or dark-colored bodily secretions. Given this patient’s short survival after his initial presentation, prognosis should be discussed at the time of diagnosis. Other differential diagnoses include hemochromatosis, most notably the hereditary form, which demonstrates skin hyperpigmentation in most cases. Elevated liver function levels are more likely related to worsening hepatic metastases. In this case, hemochromatosis is less likely given the patient’s unremarkable family history and the absence of other clinical features of hemochromatosis, including arthropathy or diabetes.

Immunohistochemical staining showed large cells positive for CD20 (Figure, C), BCL6, and CD30, and negative for CD10, consistent with a diagnosis of polymorphic primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PCNS-PTLD).Initially described in 1968,1 PTLD is a potentially fatal complication of both solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The incidence of PTLD varies based on type of transplanted organ, immunosuppressive regimen, and patient characteristics. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder manifesting after solid organ transplant (SOT) occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of cases, with highest incidence in intestinal and multiple organ transplant recipients (5%-20%), followed by lung and heart transplant (2%-10%), and then pancreatic, renal, and liver transplant (1%-5%).2,3The World Health Organization divides PTLD into 3 pathologic categories: early lesions, polymorphic, and monomorphic, with monomorphic PTLD fulfilling the criteria for one of the B-cell or natural killer/T-cell neoplasms recognized in immunocompetent individuals.4 About 50% of PTLD cases are driven by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in the setting of immunosuppression and subsequent T-cell inhibition.5 This patient’s pathology was positive for EBV, confirmed by in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA; however, circulating EBV DNA was not detected in the serum.Primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder comprises 5% to 15% of all PTLD cases.6 Neuroradiographic findings of PCNS-PTLD are nonspecific and tend to have overlapping features with CNS infections and primary CNS lymphoma in immunocompromised individuals. Several case series7,8 report multicentric, contrast-enhancing, intra-axial lesions with extensive edema and marked expansion of the perivascular spaces. These lesions tend to be deeper in supratentorial structures and periventricular regions, and occur less often in the cerebellum and brainstem.6 Manifestations in the spinal cord and leptomeninges are rare.7,8 Given that isolated CNS involvement of PTLD is uncommon, clinical evaluation should include complete staging with positron emission tomography/CT to exclude systemic involvement. Diagnosis of PCNS-PTLD is established by immunohistopathologic analysis of a tissue biopsy specimen.Primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder appears to embody a distinct clinicopathologic entity within the PTLD spectrum. Although the highest incidence of PTLD occurs within the first year after transplant, the median time from solid organ transplant to PCNS-PTLD diagnosis is 3 to 5 years.7-9 Compared with non-CNS PTLD, PCNS-PTLD is more frequently associated with higher rates of EBV infection, prior renal transplant, and monomorphic as opposed to polymorphic subtype.8,9Given the rarity of PCNS-PTLD, no standardized treatment has been established. Treatment options for PCNS-PTLD are dictated by the underlying morphologic subtype and include reduction of immunosuppression for all lesions, with inclusion of rituximab therapy for polymorphic lesions.8,9 Chemotherapy should be used to treat the functionally able patient with monomorphic PCNS-PTLD. Agents with proven efficacy in the treatment of PCNS lymphoma, including high-dose methotrexate, are often used to treat PCNS-PTLD.10 Whole-brain radiotherapy remains an option for relapsed or refractory disease.Prognosis remains suboptimal for PCNS-PTLD, with a multicenter study of 84 patients demonstrating a 3-year progression-free survival rate of 32% and an overall survival rate of 43%.9 Response to first-line therapy, rather than choice of treatment, was the most important predictor of progression-free survival and Overall survival among patients with PCNS-PTLD.9The patient was diagnosed with polymorphic, EBV-positive PCNS-PTLD 4 years after renal transplant. After diagnosis, mycophenolate was discontinued and the tacrolimus trough goal was reduced. The patient also received 4 weekly doses of rituximab.

Immunohistochemical staining showed large cells positive for CD20 (Figure, C), BCL6, and CD30, and negative for CD10, consistent with a diagnosis of polymorphic primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PCNS-PTLD).Initially described in 1968,1 PTLD is a potentially fatal complication of both solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The incidence of PTLD varies based on type of transplanted organ, immunosuppressive regimen, and patient characteristics. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder manifesting after solid organ transplant (SOT) occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of cases, with highest incidence in intestinal and multiple organ transplant recipients (5%-20%), followed by lung and heart transplant (2%-10%), and then pancreatic, renal, and liver transplant (1%-5%).2,3The World Health Organization divides PTLD into 3 pathologic categories: early lesions, polymorphic, and monomorphic, with monomorphic PTLD fulfilling the criteria for one of the B-cell or natural killer/T-cell neoplasms recognized in immunocompetent individuals.4 About 50% of PTLD cases are driven by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in the setting of immunosuppression and subsequent T-cell inhibition.5 This patient’s pathology was positive for EBV, confirmed by in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA; however, circulating EBV DNA was not detected in the serum.Primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder comprises 5% to 15% of all PTLD cases.6 Neuroradiographic findings of PCNS-PTLD are nonspecific and tend to have overlapping features with CNS infections and primary CNS lymphoma in immunocompromised individuals. Several case series7,8 report multicentric, contrast-enhancing, intra-axial lesions with extensive edema and marked expansion of the perivascular spaces. These lesions tend to be deeper in supratentorial structures and periventricular regions, and occur less often in the cerebellum and brainstem.6 Manifestations in the spinal cord and leptomeninges are rare.7,8 Given that isolated CNS involvement of PTLD is uncommon, clinical evaluation should include complete staging with positron emission tomography/CT to exclude systemic involvement. Diagnosis of PCNS-PTLD is established by immunohistopathologic analysis of a tissue biopsy specimen.Primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder appears to embody a distinct clinicopathologic entity within the PTLD spectrum. Although the highest incidence of PTLD occurs within the first year after transplant, the median time from solid organ transplant to PCNS-PTLD diagnosis is 3 to 5 years.7-9 Compared with non-CNS PTLD, PCNS-PTLD is more frequently associated with higher rates of EBV infection, prior renal transplant, and monomorphic as opposed to polymorphic subtype.8,9Given the rarity of PCNS-PTLD, no standardized treatment has been established. Treatment options for PCNS-PTLD are dictated by the underlying morphologic subtype and include reduction of immunosuppression for all lesions, with inclusion of rituximab therapy for polymorphic lesions.8,9 Chemotherapy should be used to treat the functionally able patient with monomorphic PCNS-PTLD. Agents with proven efficacy in the treatment of PCNS lymphoma, including high-dose methotrexate, are often used to treat PCNS-PTLD.10 Whole-brain radiotherapy remains an option for relapsed or refractory disease.Prognosis remains suboptimal for PCNS-PTLD, with a multicenter study of 84 patients demonstrating a 3-year progression-free survival rate of 32% and an overall survival rate of 43%.9 Response to first-line therapy, rather than choice of treatment, was the most important predictor of progression-free survival and Overall survival among patients with PCNS-PTLD.9The patient was diagnosed with polymorphic, EBV-positive PCNS-PTLD 4 years after renal transplant. After diagnosis, mycophenolate was discontinued and the tacrolimus trough goal was reduced. The patient also received 4 weekly doses of rituximab. She subsequently had improvement in neurologic function. This case highlights the importance of maintaining clinical suspicion for delayed and rare presentations of PTLD in transplant recipients. Multicenter analyses of treatment and outcome data are warranted given the uncertainties regarding optimal initial therapy in this patient population.",Oncology,"A patient in them 30s presented with frequent falls, right-sided lower-extremity weakness, and intermittent confusion.

The findings from a biopsy specimen of a lung lesion revealed small cell carcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer and began systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. Unfortunately, the patient died soon after the first dose of chemotherapy due to neutropenic sepsis.Cutaneous manifestation of an internal malignant neoplasm may present as direct infiltration into the skin or may present indirectly as a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS).1 The Curth postulates are the cornerstone for defining the association between internal malignant neoplasms and cutaneous disorders.1 Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a histopathologic term denoting vasculitis of the small vessels with predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate.2 After degranulation, the neutrophils undergo apoptosis, a process known as leukocytoclasis, releasing nuclear debris, which is also called nuclear dust.2 According to the consensus statement developed at the Chapel Hill Conference on Nomenclature of Systemic Vasculitis in 1994, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (CLV) is defined as an“[i]solated cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis without systemic vasculitis or glomerulonephritis.”2,3 As a PNS, CLV is the most commonly diagnosed vasculitis (45%) followed by polyarteritis nodosa (36.7%).4 Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis occurs most frequently with hematologic cancers followed by lung, gastrointestinal, or urinary tract tumors.5,6 Approximately 20% to 26% of patients with paraneoplastic CLV have lung cancer.4,6 Among lung cancers, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell are most commonly associated with CLV.4,6,7Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis presents as a palpable purpuric lesion that usually involves the dependent areas (mostly feet and lower extremities) and rarely involves the upper extremities and trunk.2 The lesions are usually chronic and persistent when associated with a malignant neoplasm.2 In contrast to the chronic pattern of CLV, Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a recurring form of CLV that presents with symptom-free intervals.3,8 Deposits of IgA in the blood vessels are a defining feature of HSP. Henoch-Schönlein purpura usually affects children and has been reported as a PNS associated with solid organ malignant neoplasms, including small cell lung cancer.2,9 The diagnostic workup includes a skin biopsy to differentiate other cutaneous lesions from underlying vasculitis. Preferably, an immunofluorescence stain should be done in addition to a hematoxylin and eosin stain.2 However, the diagnostic yield of this test is considerably reduced after 48 hours owing to the destruction and removal of immunoglobulins deposited in the vessel wall.2 Judicious use of immunofluorescence for selected cases has been advocated recently, but the test is not readily available in settings with constrained resources, such as ours.10 In patients with chronic CLV, other causes not related to malignant neoplasms should be excluded, including hepatitis B and/or C virus, HIV, cryoglobulinemia, and systemic small-vessel vasculitis.The pathogenesis of CLV remains anecdotal. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a common response to circulating aggressors, be it microorganisms or immune complexes, and is likely influenced by the heterogeneity of the endothelium of postcapillary venules.2 The endothelial cells in these venules play a role in antigen presentation, and express Toll-like receptor family members, CD32 molecules, and histamine H1 receptors.2 Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis usually begins with deposition of immune complex in the vessel walls, leading to activation of the complement cascade (complement components C3a and C5a), which attracts neutrophils and eventually leads to degranulation and vessel wall destruction.2 The treatment of CLV associated with systemic malignant neoplasms is directed toward the primary cause, whereby improvement or worsening of the rash is seen in concordance with the treatment response of the underlying cancer.1,4 This case illustrates the importance of recognizing cutaneous manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes, which can prompt an early diagnosis of an occult malignant neoplasm.",Oncology,"A 70-year-old Indian woman presented with a generalized rash over the lower extremity associated with pedal edema extending up to the shins.

Unfortunately, the patient died soon after the first dose of chemotherapy due to neutropenic sepsis.Cutaneous manifestation of an internal malignant neoplasm may present as direct infiltration into the skin or may present indirectly as a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS).1 The Curth postulates are the cornerstone for defining the association between internal malignant neoplasms and cutaneous disorders.1 Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a histopathologic term denoting vasculitis of the small vessels with predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate.2 After degranulation, the neutrophils undergo apoptosis, a process known as leukocytoclasis, releasing nuclear debris, which is also called nuclear dust.2 According to the consensus statement developed at the Chapel Hill Conference on Nomenclature of Systemic Vasculitis in 1994, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (CLV) is defined as an“[i]solated cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis without systemic vasculitis or glomerulonephritis.”2,3 As a PNS, CLV is the most commonly diagnosed vasculitis (45%) followed by polyarteritis nodosa (36.7%).4 Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis occurs most frequently with hematologic cancers followed by lung, gastrointestinal, or urinary tract tumors.5,6 Approximately 20% to 26% of patients with paraneoplastic CLV have lung cancer.4,6 Among lung cancers, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell are most commonly associated with CLV.4,6,7Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis presents as a palpable purpuric lesion that usually involves the dependent areas (mostly feet and lower extremities) and rarely involves the upper extremities and trunk.2 The lesions are usually chronic and persistent when associated with a malignant neoplasm.2 In contrast to the chronic pattern of CLV, Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a recurring form of CLV that presents with symptom-free intervals.3,8 Deposits of IgA in the blood vessels are a defining feature of HSP. Henoch-Schönlein purpura usually affects children and has been reported as a PNS associated with solid organ malignant neoplasms, including small cell lung cancer.2,9 The diagnostic workup includes a skin biopsy to differentiate other cutaneous lesions from underlying vasculitis. Preferably, an immunofluorescence stain should be done in addition to a hematoxylin and eosin stain.2 However, the diagnostic yield of this test is considerably reduced after 48 hours owing to the destruction and removal of immunoglobulins deposited in the vessel wall.2 Judicious use of immunofluorescence for selected cases has been advocated recently, but the test is not readily available in settings with constrained resources, such as ours.10 In patients with chronic CLV, other causes not related to malignant neoplasms should be excluded, including hepatitis B and/or C virus, HIV, cryoglobulinemia, and systemic small-vessel vasculitis.The pathogenesis of CLV remains anecdotal. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a common response to circulating aggressors, be it microorganisms or immune complexes, and is likely influenced by the heterogeneity of the endothelium of postcapillary venules.2 The endothelial cells in these venules play a role in antigen presentation, and express Toll-like receptor family members, CD32 molecules, and histamine H1 receptors.2 Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis usually begins with deposition of immune complex in the vessel walls, leading to activation of the complement cascade (complement components C3a and C5a), which attracts neutrophils and eventually leads to degranulation and vessel wall destruction.2 The treatment of CLV associated with systemic malignant neoplasms is directed toward the primary cause, whereby improvement or worsening of the rash is seen in concordance with the treatment response of the underlying cancer.1,4 This case illustrates the importance of recognizing cutaneous manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes, which can prompt an early diagnosis of an occult malignant neoplasm.",Oncology,"A 70-year-old Indian man presented with a generalized rash over the lower extremity associated with pedal edema extending up to the shins.

The patient was scheduled for chemotherapy; however, he was subsequently unavailable for follow-up.Burkitt lymphoma is a rapidly proliferating, aggressive B-cell neoplasm with a doubling time as short as 25 hours.1,2 It is classified into endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated types. The endemic type is mostly associated with EBV and frequently affects jaw and other facial bones of African children aged 4 to 7 years.3 The sporadic and immunodeficiency-associated subtypes are more common in adults and frequently present with extranodal (particularly gastrointestinal tract) involvement.2 Sporadic types often do not show the rearrangement of the c-Myc and immunoglobulin genes, and EBV positivity is seen in less than 15% to 30% patients. Immunodeficiency type is observed in patients with HIV infection, allograft recipients, and patients with primary immunodeficiency. It is more frequent in patients with CD4 cell counts of 200/μL or higher, and EBV positivity is observed in 40% of patients or more.4 Burkitt lymphoma is composed of monomorphic, intermediate-sized, mature B cells, which are positive for CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a, CD10, and Bcl6 but negative for CD5 and Bcl2, with abundant mitotic figures and a typical starry-sky appearance on histologic analysis.2 The genetic hallmark of BL is overexpression of c-Myc, which drives its pathogenesis.5Cutaneous presentation of BL is rare and mostly attributed to hematogenous spread, local invasion, or iatrogenic seeding of malignant cells through surgical procedures.6 This case showed evidence of regional metastases on the same side of the chest, back, and abdomen, not directly communicating with the main tumor. These, in our opinion, represent extensions of tumor via lymphatics as evidenced by predominant subcutaneous tissue involvement in the patient.1,7The main differential diagnoses of BL include other high-grade B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Immunohistochemical features that favor BL over DLBCL are CD10+, Bcl6+, Bcl2−, and TdT−, with a Ki-67 index close to 100%.8 Dysregulation of c-Myc can occur as a primary event in BL or as a secondary event in 5% to 15% of patients with DLBCL and 30% to 50% of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas unclassified with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL. Secondary c-Myc changes occur often against a background of complex karyotype and often confer aggressive clinical behavior, including poor survival rate and increased risk of relapse in the central nervous system. The adverse prognosis arises because of concurrent BCL2 (OMIM 151430) or BCL6 (OMIM 109565) gene rearrangements, which are subsequently termed double- or triple-hit lymphomas.8Leukemia cutis can be easily ruled out based on characteristic histologic and immunohistochemical findings.9 AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma appears more erythematous-violaceous and has characteristic histopathologic features with vascular proliferation, slitlike spaces, and solid cords and fascicles of spindle cells interspersed between vascular channels.10In conclusion, cutaneous BL is rare, and the diagnosis is mainly confirmed by histopathologic analysis; however, the rapid increase in the size of lesions in this patient was an important clinical clue.",Oncology,"A man in his 30s presented with painless swelling of the left upper limb and nodules on the left side of the chest and abdomen.

It is more frequent in patients with CD4 cell counts of 200/μL or higher, and EBV positivity is observed in 40% of patients or more.4 Burkitt lymphoma is composed of monomorphic, intermediate-sized, mature B cells, which are positive for CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a, CD10, and Bcl6 but negative for CD5 and Bcl2, with abundant mitotic figures and a typical starry-sky appearance on histologic analysis.2 The genetic hallmark of BL is overexpression of c-Myc, which drives its pathogenesis.5Cutaneous presentation of BL is rare and mostly attributed to hematogenous spread, local invasion, or iatrogenic seeding of malignant cells through surgical procedures.6 This case showed evidence of regional metastases on the same side of the chest, back, and abdomen, not directly communicating with the main tumor. These, in our opinion, represent extensions of tumor via lymphatics as evidenced by predominant subcutaneous tissue involvement in the patient.1,7The main differential diagnoses of BL include other high-grade B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Immunohistochemical features that favor BL over DLBCL are CD10+, Bcl6+, Bcl2−, and TdT−, with a Ki-67 index close to 100%.8 Dysregulation of c-Myc can occur as a primary event in BL or as a secondary event in 5% to 15% of patients with DLBCL and 30% to 50% of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas unclassified with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL. Secondary c-Myc changes occur often against a background of complex karyotype and often confer aggressive clinical behavior, including poor survival rate and increased risk of relapse in the central nervous system. The adverse prognosis arises because of concurrent BCL2 (OMIM 151430) or BCL6 (OMIM 109565) gene rearrangements, which are subsequently termed double- or triple-hit lymphomas.8Leukemia cutis can be easily ruled out based on characteristic histologic and immunohistochemical findings.9 AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma appears more erythematous-violaceous and has characteristic histopathologic features with vascular proliferation, slitlike spaces, and solid cords and fascicles of spindle cells interspersed between vascular channels.10In conclusion, cutaneous BL is rare, and the diagnosis is mainly confirmed by histopathologic analysis; however, the rapid increase in the size of lesions in this patient was an important clinical clue.",Oncology,"A patient in their 30s presented with painless swelling of the left upper limb and nodules on the left side of the chest and abdomen.

While being evaluated for the cutaneous lesions, the patient was diagnosed with AIDS and began antiretroviral therapy.On examination, 6 erythematous, firm, subcutaneous nodules were present on the left side of the chest, abdomen, and left upper limb, varying in size from 2 × 2 cm to 4 × 4 cm (Figure, A). There was diffuse erythema and edema on the left upper limb, leading to difficulty in limb movement (Figure, A). Multiple dilated superficial vessels were present on the posterior aspect of the left arm and ipsilateral chest wall. Left axillary lymph nodes were grossly enlarged, firm, nontender, and nonmatted, with the largest lymph node measuring 6 × 4 cm.

Nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis,B,Nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis,"Immunologic checkpoint blockade has changed the treatment landscape for advanced melanoma with impressive response and survival rates,1 but it is associated with a large spectrum of immune-related toxic effects owing to an increase of the baseline T-cell–specific immune response.2,3 Skin toxic effects represent the most common adverse effects associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, including pruritus, rash, vitiligolike depigmentation, and lichenoid, cytotoxic, and autoimmune bullous reactions.4 Interestingly, appearance of these adverse effects, especially vitiligo, is associated with a superior outcome and treatment response.5Panniculitis is a group of inflammatory disorders of the subcutaneous fat tissue. Diagnosis can be challenging because different forms of panniculitis may present with overlapping clinical findings. Panniculitis can either be classified clinically based on the cause (eg, infection, inflammation, trauma, enzymatic destruction, deposition, or cancer) or histologically as lobular or septal panniculitis with or without concomitant vasculitis. As for drug-induced panniculitis, clinical and histopathological features of drug-induced panniculitis are indistinguishable from those associated with other agents, and only the history of previous drug intake or clinical improvement after drug treatment interruption may prove a causative relationship.6Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common type of panniculitis located on the anterior surface of the lower extremities. Mostly idiopathic in origin, EN may indicate an underlying systematic disease such as tuberculosis, deep bacterial and/or fungal infection, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer. Erythema nodosum represents the cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis. Histologically, septal panniculitis can present without vasculitis and with radial granulomas. Erythema nodosum is also reported to be the most common drug-induced panniculitis.7In the setting of immune checkpoint inhibitors used for cell-mediated immunity, few reports in the literature have described a sarcoidlike granulomatous panniculitis.7-9 The typical histological pattern includes partly granulomatous reactions with mixed septal and lobular inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes and epithelioid histiocytes.Herein, we report a case of lobular panniculitis without vasculitis. Lobular panniculitis is usually considered in connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, pancreatic diseases or α-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Other histopathologic differential diagnoses include infection, trauma, or subcutaneous T-cell lymphoma.10 All of these differential diagnoses were ruled out through diagnostic workup in the present case. The absence of tumor cells in the biopsy specimen ruled out disease progression.The treatment with nivolumab was continued unchanged, and the patient achieved a complete metabolic response seen in the routine follow-up 18F-FDG PET-CTs. As for the panniculitis, the lesion regressed slowly without the need for systemic steroid or treatment cessation.With regard to the treatment approach for immunotherapy-induced panniculitis, the lesions usually regress spontaneously or after treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral or topical steroids. Cessation of immunotherapy is not generally necessary.To our knowledge, this is the first case of an extensive lobular panniculitis in a patient treated with an anti–PD-1 antibody. Until recently, panniculitides associated with immunotherapeutic agents have not been extensively described. Because inconclusive FDG-avid lesions may simulate disease progression, recognition of these adverse effects is important, and histopathological workup is mandatory to ensure adequate treatment and prevent unnecessary treatment discontinuation.",Oncology,"A 41-year-old patient with a history of Hodgkin disease in them adolescence was diagnosed with melanoma of the left upper thigh that was classified as American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IIA with (pT3aN0 [sn0/1] M0) BRAF mutation.

In addition to the high hemoglobin level, mild lymphocytosis (absolute lymphocyte count, 6.2 × 109/L, range 1.5-4.0 × 109/L) was noted with the lymphocyte morphology, suggesting reactive changes. Skin biopsy specimen (Figure, B) showed a normal epidermis with a pericapillary infiltrate of small lymphocytes restricted to the dermis and no leukocytoclastic vasculitis, fungal organisms, or dermal mucin. The absence of cellular atypia and epidermal involvement suggested a diagnosis of lupus, or gyrate or annular erythema, and the need for clinicopathological correlation.A, Photograph shows erythroderma.

Sliding hernia,A,Sliding hernia,"Inguinal hernias are one of the most common surgical diseases and account for up to 28% of all elective surgical cases performed in the United States.1 Because other diseases may mimic this condition, it is important to recognize other pathologies, as treatment may be different. Saphena varix may also present as a “groin bulge,” but it is a dilation of the saphenous vein due to valvular incompetence. Amyand hernia is an inguinal hernia containing the appendix. Therefore, an appendectomy may also be indicated at the time of inguinal hernia repair. Communicating hydrocele is when fluid flows between the scrotum and peritoneal cavity because of a patent processus vaginalis. Sliding hernias occur when a retroperitoneal organ constitutes part of the hernia sac.Sliding hernias that contain the bladder occur in about 1% to 4%2 of cases. The incidence of inguinal hernias containing ureter is extremely rare,3 and as of 2013, fewer than 140 cases have been reported.4 Associated bladder herniation is present in 25% of cases with inguinal hernias containing the ureter.5 Severe complications, such as renal failure, have been reported because of ureteral herniation, which is why it is crucial to identify these types of hernias. Comorbidities, such a liver dysfunction, can further complicate hernia repair and postoperative outcomes. In this case, the patient had a sliding hernia with the bladder and the right ureter constituting a portion of the hernia sac, resulting in right hydroureter and hydronephrosis and frequent urinary tract infections.Risk factors for bladder herniation include older age, male sex, obesity, previous herniorrhaphy, and lower urinary tract obstruction, such as in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Most of these are asymptomatic and diagnosed intraoperatively.6 Ureteral hernias most often occur on the right side and can present with abdominal pain, renal colic, or obstructive uropathy.5 Imaging scans to identify bladder and/or ureteral inguinal hernias include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, a pyelogram, and/or a cystogram,2 which are important to obtain so that in addition to operative planning any additional anatomic abnormalities, such as ectopic kidneys, can be detected. Surgical repair is indicated in cases in which the bladder and/or ureter are contained within the hernia sac, because if they are left untreated, it can lead to complications, such as renal failure or urosepsis. It must be noted that when these cases are diagnosed intraoperatively, the operating surgeon must be alert as to not inadvertently injure these structures, which can occur in up to 12% of cases.7Complications due to a fully or partially obstructed bladder and/or ureter in an inguinal hernia can be fully reversed after surgical intervention and can have a dramatic improvement in the quality of life. For example, the resolution of frequent urinary tract infections and hydroureter/hydronephrosis that was noted on postoperative ultrasonography results allowed this patient to return to a normal lifestyle. The involvement of multidisciplinary teams, such as general surgeons and urologists, can aid in workup (ie, cystoscopy) and surgical intervention (ie, bladder or ureteral resection or repair if needed). Additionally, malignancy of the bladder or prostate has been reported in up to 11.2% of patients with bladder herniation. Therefore, these patients must be followed up closely and undergo screening tests.6Comorbidities increase the risk of overall complications for inguinal hernia repair. Cirrhosis in particular is generally a feared health problem, especially in regards to hernia repair, but in recent studies, the presence of cirrhosis (regardless of Child Turcotte Pugh score) did not significantly increase the risk of complications or recurrence.8 Aggressively controlling ascites preoperatively and postoperatively is needed to optimize a patient’s outcome.

Sliding hernia,A,Sliding hernia,"Inguinal hernias are one of the most common surgical diseases and account for up to 28% of all elective surgical cases performed in the United States.1 Because other diseases may mimic this condition, it is important to recognize other pathologies, as treatment may be different. Saphena varix may also present as a “groin bulge,” but it is a dilation of the saphenous vein due to valvular incompetence. Amyand hernia is an inguinal hernia containing the appendix. Therefore, an appendectomy may also be indicated at the time of inguinal hernia repair. Communicating hydrocele is when fluid flows between the scrotum and peritoneal cavity because of a patent processus vaginalis. Sliding hernias occur when a retroperitoneal organ constitutes part of the hernia sac.Sliding hernias that contain the bladder occur in about 1% to 4%2 of cases. The incidence of inguinal hernias containing ureter is extremely rare,3 and as of 2013, fewer than 140 cases have been reported.4 Associated bladder herniation is present in 25% of cases with inguinal hernias containing the ureter.5 Severe complications, such as renal failure, have been reported because of ureteral herniation, which is why it is crucial to identify these types of hernias. Comorbidities, such a liver dysfunction, can further complicate hernia repair and postoperative outcomes. In this case, the patient had a sliding hernia with the bladder and the right ureter constituting a portion of the hernia sac, resulting in right hydroureter and hydronephrosis and frequent urinary tract infections.Risk factors for bladder herniation include older age, male sex, obesity, previous herniorrhaphy, and lower urinary tract obstruction, such as in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Most of these are asymptomatic and diagnosed intraoperatively.6 Ureteral hernias most often occur on the right side and can present with abdominal pain, renal colic, or obstructive uropathy.5 Imaging scans to identify bladder and/or ureteral inguinal hernias include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, a pyelogram, and/or a cystogram,2 which are important to obtain so that in addition to operative planning any additional anatomic abnormalities, such as ectopic kidneys, can be detected. Surgical repair is indicated in cases in which the bladder and/or ureter are contained within the hernia sac, because if they are left untreated, it can lead to complications, such as renal failure or urosepsis. It must be noted that when these cases are diagnosed intraoperatively, the operating surgeon must be alert as to not inadvertently injure these structures, which can occur in up to 12% of cases.7Complications due to a fully or partially obstructed bladder and/or ureter in an inguinal hernia can be fully reversed after surgical intervention and can have a dramatic improvement in the quality of life. For example, the resolution of frequent urinary tract infections and hydroureter/hydronephrosis that was noted on postoperative ultrasonography results allowed this patient to return to a normal lifestyle. The involvement of multidisciplinary teams, such as general surgeons and urologists, can aid in workup (ie, cystoscopy) and surgical intervention (ie, bladder or ureteral resection or repair if needed). Additionally, malignancy of the bladder or prostate has been reported in up to 11.2% of patients with bladder herniation. Therefore, these patients must be followed up closely and undergo screening tests.6Comorbidities increase the risk of overall complications for inguinal hernia repair. Cirrhosis in particular is generally a feared health problem, especially in regards to hernia repair, but in recent studies, the presence of cirrhosis (regardless of Child Turcotte Pugh score) did not significantly increase the risk of complications or recurrence.8 Aggressively controlling ascites preoperatively and postoperatively is needed to optimize a patient’s outcome. In this particular case, the patient developed mildly increased liver dysfunction postoperatively that was managed conservatively, and his levels subsequently returned to baseline.The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course. He had a transient and self-limiting increase in liver function test results but was otherwise asymptomatic. Repeated renal ultrasonography revealed resolution of the hydroureter and the patient reported a greatly improved quality of life.",Surgery,"A 55-year-old patient with a history of Childs B cirrhosis presented with a 2.5-year history of right groin pain and increased urinary frequency with difficulty voiding.

Common dermatologic adverse effects of anti–PD-1 therapies include mucosal erosions, papular eruptions with overlying scale, and pruritus.2 The reported incidence of dermatologic immune-related adverse effects to anti–PD-1 monotherapy varies, but between 1.2% and 11% of patients receiving anti–PD-1 monotherapy experience a lichenoid cutaneous reaction, 12% to 25% experience pruritus, and 2.6% to 15% experience vitiligo.3-5 Regardless of tumor type, anti–PD-1–induced dermatitis typically presents as discrete papules or nodules limited to 1 region of the body or as larger plaques generally distributed over the trunk.2 Despite this variation in clinical presentation, histopathologic study of anti–PD-1 dermatitis almost always shows lichenoid infiltrates composed of CD4 lymphocytes within the dermis and CD8 lymphocytes within the epithelium.2The mechanism of lichenoid drug reactions has not been elucidated, nor has the mechanism of cutaneous reactions to anti–PD-1 therapy. The leading hypothesis is that antagonizing PD-1 leads to T-lymphocyte–mediated toxic effects directed against basal keratinocytes.6The time from initiation of anti–PD-1 therapy to cutaneous presentation varies, but cutaneous events have been reported from 3 days to 13 months after starting treatment and can also occur after discontinuation of treatment.2 Anti–PD-1–induced dermatitis is generally easy to manage with topical or intralesional glucocorticoid drugs and does not always require discontinuation of pembrolizumab or nivolumab therapy because they are typically not high grade per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology of Criteria of Adverse Events, version 4.03.2 There is evidence to suggest that the development of cutaneous reactions after anti-PD1 therapy may be associated with improved tumor response and increased patient survival.6,7 Future research regarding the association between immune-related adverse events and outcomes after anti–PD-1 therapy is needed and currently ongoing.The patient was prescribed triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% ointment to be applied to the affected area twice daily and a series of intralesional corticosteroid injections, with improvement in the appearance of the papules and plaques over the course of several months.

Opening of the sac revealed the small bowel to be compressed and kinked longitudinally and transversely, resulting in mechanical obstruction (Figure 2).The dense fibrous capsule was opened longitudinally to reveal the small bowel compressed and kinked within.Also known as abdominal cocoon syndrome, SEP is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction in which part or all of the small bowel, and sometimes the colon, becomes encased and compressed in a fibrous sac.1 The condition can be primary (idiopathic), classically seen in adolescent girls in tropical latitudes,1,2 or secondary, most commonly caused by chronic peritoneal dialysis.1,3 Other known secondary causes include chronic inflammatory or infectious insults such as recurrent peritonitis, intraperitoneal chemotherapy, peritovenous or ventriculoperitoneal shunting, systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, abdominal tuberculosis, and parasitic infections.1-4 Clinical presentation usually includes symptoms of progressive chronic or intermittent intestinal obstruction, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, and abdominal mass.1,4,5Sometimes, SEP can be diagnosed on preoperative imaging, but often it is diagnosed only during operative intervention.1 Early cases with partial or intermittent obstruction may respond to nonoperative management, but the mainstay of treatment is the complete operative stripping and resection of the encasing rind. The available literature on SEP is dominated by single case reports, but several single-institution case series exist. These studies involve 18 to 65 patients with long-term recurrent obstruction rates, ranging from 0% to 28% after the full resection of the fibrous encapsulating sheath, and with at least 1 year of follow-up.4-7 The largest of these case series identified preoperative nutritional optimization and intraoperative intestinal stenting to be protective against early recurrent obstruction.4After the diagnosis of idiopathic SEP during the initial operation, the patient underwent the placement of a decompressive gastrostomy tube and then remained in the hospital for parenteral nutritional optimization. Later, he returned to the operating room for stripping and excision of the fibrous capsule from the entire involved bowel as well as lysis of thin adhesions between loops of bowel within the capsule.

Opening of the sac revealed the small bowel to be compressed and kinked longitudinally and transversely, resulting in mechanical obstruction (Figure 2).The dense fibrous capsule was opened longitudinally to reveal the small bowel compressed and kinked within.Also known as abdominal cocoon syndrome, SEP is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction in which part or all of the small bowel, and sometimes the colon, becomes encased and compressed in a fibrous sac.1 The condition can be primary (idiopathic), classically seen in adolescent girls in tropical latitudes,1,2 or secondary, most commonly caused by chronic peritoneal dialysis.1,3 Other known secondary causes include chronic inflammatory or infectious insults such as recurrent peritonitis, intraperitoneal chemotherapy, peritovenous or ventriculoperitoneal shunting, systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, abdominal tuberculosis, and parasitic infections.1-4 Clinical presentation usually includes symptoms of progressive chronic or intermittent intestinal obstruction, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, and abdominal mass.1,4,5Sometimes, SEP can be diagnosed on preoperative imaging, but often it is diagnosed only during operative intervention.1 Early cases with partial or intermittent obstruction may respond to nonoperative management, but the mainstay of treatment is the complete operative stripping and resection of the encasing rind. The available literature on SEP is dominated by single case reports, but several single-institution case series exist.

Later, he returned to the operating room for stripping and excision of the fibrous capsule from the entire involved bowel as well as lysis of thin adhesions between loops of bowel within the capsule.

Follicular lymphoma,B,Follicular lymphoma,"Scalp lesion, lymph node, and bone marrow biopsy demonstrated involvement by CD10-positive, low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), consistent with follicular lymphoma. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed extensive hypermetabolic activity in the scalp soft tissue (standardized uptake value [SUV], 7.0) (Figure 2) and in the cervical (SUV, 9.1), axillary, upper thoracic, and abdominal lymph nodes (SUV, 3.9) compatible with lymphoma with a FLIPI score (Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index) of 5. The patient underwent 6 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and achieved a complete response verified by PET scan after cycle 4.Positron emission tomography reveals extensive hypermetabolic activity in the scalp soft tissue.Follicular lymphoma is one of the most common subtypes of NHL and is the most common of the clinically indolent NHLs. In the United States, follicular lymphoma accounts for approximately 35% of NHLs, the majority of which present with diffuse lymphadenopathy. In the present case, the patient had clear evidence of systemic disease, but the skin involvement was the most prominent presenting feature. Skin involvement is uncommon in follicular lymphoma, reported in fewer than 5% of the patients.Histopathologic examination of the skin lesion exhibited a predominant follicular pattern of small B cells that tested positive for CD20, CD10, Bcl2, and Bcl6 and negative for CD3, CD5, TdT, cyclin D1, and CD21, consistent with follicular lymphoma. The proportion of centroblasts was fewer than 15 per high-power field, and there were no morphologic areas of transformation to large B-cell lymphoma. However, the lymphoma exhibited some atypical features, demonstrating lymphoid cells with blastoid cytomorphologic characteristics rather than classic centrocytes. In addition, there were focal areas of increased mitotic activity. While overall Ki-67 nuclear proliferation rate was not substantially elevated, in some foci it was as high as 40%. Follicular lymphoma with blastoid features, or a “blastoid variant” of follicular lymphoma, is not a defined category owing to a lack of a reproducible definition of blastoid features in the literature.1-4At first glance the scalp lesion in the present case is suggestive of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, especially mycosis fungoides. However, the predominant presence of monoclonal B cells in the scalp biopsy (Figure 1B), the lack of epidermotropism and Pautrier microabscesses, and the absence of immunophenotypic evidence of a T-cell neoplasm argue against this diagnosis.The location and size of the lesion would also be atypical for lichen planus, which, in addition, is an unlikely cause of diffuse lymphadenopathy. On histopathologic analysis, lichen planus usually demonstrates a bandlike infiltrate at the dermal-epidermal interface with extension of lymphocytes into basal and parabasal keratinocytes. The epidermis may demonstrate prominent acanthosis and hyperkeratosis.Marginal zone lymphoma B cells do not exhibit a germinal center profile, and they test negative for CD10 and Bcl6. They also characteristically exhibit small lymphoid cells with abundant pale cytoplasm and irregular nuclei with mature chromatin, thus showing “monocytoid appearance” of the lymphoid cells. In addition to this, the presence of centrocytes and centroblasts in the present case argue against a diagnosis of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.",Oncology,"A 67-year-old man presented with a rapidly enlarging scalp lesion (Figure 1A) first noticed 3 months earlier as a pimple.

Follicular lymphoma,B,Follicular lymphoma,"Scalp lesion, lymph node, and bone marrow biopsy demonstrated involvement by CD10-positive, low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), consistent with follicular lymphoma. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed extensive hypermetabolic activity in the scalp soft tissue (standardized uptake value [SUV], 7.0) (Figure 2) and in the cervical (SUV, 9.1), axillary, upper thoracic, and abdominal lymph nodes (SUV, 3.9) compatible with lymphoma with a FLIPI score (Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index) of 5. The patient underwent 6 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and achieved a complete response verified by PET scan after cycle 4.Positron emission tomography reveals extensive hypermetabolic activity in the scalp soft tissue.Follicular lymphoma is one of the most common subtypes of NHL and is the most common of the clinically indolent NHLs. In the United States, follicular lymphoma accounts for approximately 35% of NHLs, the majority of which present with diffuse lymphadenopathy. In the present case, the patient had clear evidence of systemic disease, but the skin involvement was the most prominent presenting feature. Skin involvement is uncommon in follicular lymphoma, reported in fewer than 5% of the patients.Histopathologic examination of the skin lesion exhibited a predominant follicular pattern of small B cells that tested positive for CD20, CD10, Bcl2, and Bcl6 and negative for CD3, CD5, TdT, cyclin D1, and CD21, consistent with follicular lymphoma. The proportion of centroblasts was fewer than 15 per high-power field, and there were no morphologic areas of transformation to large B-cell lymphoma. However, the lymphoma exhibited some atypical features, demonstrating lymphoid cells with blastoid cytomorphologic characteristics rather than classic centrocytes. In addition, there were focal areas of increased mitotic activity. While overall Ki-67 nuclear proliferation rate was not substantially elevated, in some foci it was as high as 40%. Follicular lymphoma with blastoid features, or a “blastoid variant” of follicular lymphoma, is not a defined category owing to a lack of a reproducible definition of blastoid features in the literature.1-4At first glance the scalp lesion in the present case is suggestive of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, especially mycosis fungoides. However, the predominant presence of monoclonal B cells in the scalp biopsy (Figure 1B), the lack of epidermotropism and Pautrier microabscesses, and the absence of immunophenotypic evidence of a T-cell neoplasm argue against this diagnosis.The location and size of the lesion would also be atypical for lichen planus, which, in addition, is an unlikely cause of diffuse lymphadenopathy. On histopathologic analysis, lichen planus usually demonstrates a bandlike infiltrate at the dermal-epidermal interface with extension of lymphocytes into basal and parabasal keratinocytes. The epidermis may demonstrate prominent acanthosis and hyperkeratosis.Marginal zone lymphoma B cells do not exhibit a germinal center profile, and they test negative for CD10 and Bcl6. They also characteristically exhibit small lymphoid cells with abundant pale cytoplasm and irregular nuclei with mature chromatin, thus showing “monocytoid appearance” of the lymphoid cells.

Fully addressing their presenting problems requires a prognosis, which is forecasting their risk (ie, probability) of developing future outcomes. The development of semistructured psychometric interviews (prognostic tools) to assess CHR-P criteria has allowed formulating a prognosis of being at risk or not at risk for psychosis.3 The original prognostic tool in this field (CAARMS2) was developed on the basis of accumulating knowledge of the specific symptoms that may predate the onset of psychosis (defined as binary outcome). The CAARMS is transdiagnostic, allowing the presence of several comorbid mental disorders at baseline, which are frequent in these patients.6 Specific training is needed to use it, and its administration usually requires 2 hours in the context of a clinical assessment.7 Extensive international validation has confirmed that in people referred to psychosis early-detection services, the CAARMS has an adequate prognostic performance, comparable with other prognostic instruments used in medicine.3 Vice versa, it does not work well outside these samples.3 Its potentials include a good ability to rule out a state of risk for psychosis, while its limitations include only a moderate ability to rule in a state of risk for psychosis (Figure).4 This prognostic tool has allowed one of the first preventive approaches to psychotic disorders to be implemented in psychiatry.8 Several other variants of the CAARMS have been developed with almost comparable prognostic performance.3 The use of these prognostic tools in individuals seeking help at psychosis early-detection clinics can impact their clinical management by (1) informing patients about their risk of developing psychosis, (2) establishing whether clinical monitoring is required, and (3) deciding whether to initiate preventive treatments or not.Individuals seeking help at specialized psychosis early-detection clinics have a higher risk of developing psychosis (15% at 3 years4) than the general population (0.43% at 3 years).5 Those who will meet the clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) criteria at the prognostic interview (Comprehensive Assessment of At-risk Mental States [CAARMS]) will have only a modest increase in their level of risk for psychosis (1.8-fold, from 15% to 26%).

Nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma,D,Nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma,"Nuclear protein in testis (NUT) midline carcinoma (NMC) is a rare aggressive human cancer that presents as a poorly differentiated carcinoma originating from midline locations and does not arise from any specific tissue type or organ.1 NUT midline carcinoma is driven by a rearrangement of the NUT gene (OMIM 608963) located on chromosome 15. This rearrangement commonly occurs between the NUT gene and a member of the BET genes family, most commonly BRD4 (OMIM 608749), resulting in the formation of the fusion oncogene BRD4-NUT.2,3 NUT midline carcinoma is extremely aggressive, with most cases presenting at an advanced stage as widely metastatic and unresectable disease when diagnosed,3,4 and has a highly lethal course.5The tumor arises in many sites, although large series suggest predilection for the head and neck and mediastinum.4 Existing literature suggests that primary pulmonary NMC is exceptionally rare and has shorter median survival when compared with the median survival reported for NMC arising at all sites (2.2 vs 6.7 months). This difference has been hypothesized to be partly owing to a relatively delayed onset of clinical symptoms for primary tumors of the lung compared with the other more common sites, for instance, the head and neck. The estimated 2-year progression-free survival is 9% based on studies incorporating all sites of disease.4From a histopathologic perspective, the appearance is commonly that of a poorly differentiated carcinoma with focal, abrupt squamous differentiation. The NMC cells are usually medium sized and round and often monomorphic in appearance in contrast to many other poorly differentiated carcinomas, which consist of highly pleomorphic large cells. These features are characteristic although not diagnostic.6 Reactivity of CD34 is occasionally seen.5The patient’s age was very unusual for conventional pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma, which is typically a disease of older patients who smoke. This characteristic, along with the characteristic histologic findings, raised the possibility of NMC. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization performed at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, demonstrated BRD4-NUT rearrangement in 66% of cells, consistent with NMC.

She denied any hematochezia or history of peptic ulcer disease. She had no other surgical history and denied alcohol use or smoking. On examination, she was hypertensive (blood pressure, 185/85 mm Hg) although not tachycardic and was afebrile. She was locally tender to palpation in the right lower quadrant with rebound and voluntary guarding. Her abdomen was not tympanitic. The patient had no abdominal scars, hernias, or palpable masses. Laboratory results were significant for the following: leukocyte count, 23 600/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) with neutrophilia (94%); blood urea nitrogen level, 28 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.357); creatinine concentration, 0.01 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4); lipase concentration, 195 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167); and lactate concentration, 2.02 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111). Electrolyte levels and liver function test results were within normal limits. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast enhancement was performed (Figure).Axial cross-sectional computed tomograms of the patient’s abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast enhancement show segmental mural thickening of the anterior cecum with wall hypoenhancement and pneumatosis, adjacent fat stranding, and a lucency medial to the cecum (A) and bilateral renal hypodensities (B). What Is Your Diagnosis?",Acute appendicitis,Colonic ischemia,Diverticulitis with perforation,Infectious colitis,B. Colonic ischemia,B,Colonic ischemia,"Computed tomography revealed cecal wall hypoenhancement with pneumatosis, sparing of the remaining colon and appendix, and bilateral renal infarcts. Given the patient’s abdominal pain, imaging findings, and history of early-onset stroke and cardiovascular disease, she was diagnosed with isolated cecal ischemia, an extremely rare presentation of acute colonic ischemia.Although the exact cause remains unclear, most cases are of nonocclusive origin,1,2 a variant of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, in which a low-flow state results in splanchnic vasoconstriction as blood flow is preferentially diverted to essential organs. It is associated with critical illness and cardiovascular disease. Occlusive causes are rarer and predominantly attributable to large arterial atherosclerotic disease with distal thromboembolism (spontaneous or after vascular procedures), cardiac arrhythmias with embolism of atrial thrombus, small arterial disease in patients with diabetes, or venous outflow obstruction from hypercoagulable states.3 Resultant segmental ischemia often occurs at watershed areas. The cecum may also represent a watershed area4 owing to its end arterial supply from the anterior and posterior cecal arteries. In most patients, there is dual arterial inflow from a vascular arcade that bridges the ileal and colic branches of the ileocolic artery5; however, the rare anatomical variant of a singular inflow off the colic branch may predispose these patients to ischemia.6 The appendix, terminal ileum, and ascending colon have multiple arterial sources, which may explain why these are at lesser risk of ischemia.Isolated cecal ischemia most commonly manifests as acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, leukocytosis, and nonspecific imaging findings of cecal wall thickening with adjacent fat stranding. It is frequently misdiagnosed as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or infectious colitis.7 A high index of suspicion is warranted, especially in elderly patients, those who are critically ill, or patients with atrial dysrhythmias or atherosclerotic disease. In addition, prompt imaging with intravenous contrast enhancement is important to evaluate for colonic ischemia. Caution is advised with colonoscopy because of the risk of perforation of a thin-walled ischemic cecum from increased intraluminal pressure.8 Mortality rates are high, and timely diagnosis is key to prevent rapid patient death.After the diagnosis is established, prompt surgical resection of the ischemic segment is crucial, although the role of primary anastomosis vs end ileostomy remains in debate.9,10 Schuler and Hudlin10 described 5 patients with isolated cecal necrosis: 4 had mucosal necrosis and underwent primary anastomosis, and 1 had transmural necrosis with perforation and underwent end ileostomy. Only the patients undergoing primary anastomosis survived. Çakar et al2 described 6 patients with transmural necrosis; half underwent primary anastomosis and the other half end ileostomy. Five patients underwent a second-look operation within 48 hours; all patients who had an initial anastomosis had evidence of staple-line ischemia and required another resection with end ileostomy. We advocate for end ileostomy in transmural necrosis; however, primary anastomosis may be considered if necrosis is limited to the mucosa when close examination of the patient is performed postoperatively.After initiation of fluid resuscitation, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and a heparin drip, the patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy. A 10 × 10–cm area of full-thickness cecal necrosis was identified with a normal appendix, terminal ileum, and ascending colon. An ileocecectomy was performed. Her renal function normalized postoperatively. The results of laboratory studies and findings of transesophageal echography were negative for a hypercoagulable cause or embolic source. Despite transition to dual antiplatelet therapy, 4 weeks postoperatively, the patient developed recurrent abdominal pain and melena with midtransverse colonic ischemia seen on imaging. She underwent another exploration with complete extended right hemicolectomy and end ileostomy. Pathologic analysis revealed transverse and ileocolic staple-line ischemia. She was transitioned to triple antithrombotic therapy and has had no embolic recurrences 1 year postoperatively.",Surgery,"A woman in her early 50s with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, diabetes, stroke, and coronary artery disease that required coronary artery bypass graft 6 years earlier presented to the emergency department with 12 hours of sudden-onset, constant, right lower quadrant abdominal pain associated with vomiting and melena.

Colonic ischemia,B,Colonic ischemia,"Computed tomography revealed cecal wall hypoenhancement with pneumatosis, sparing of the remaining colon and appendix, and bilateral renal infarcts. Given the patient’s abdominal pain, imaging findings, and history of early-onset stroke and cardiovascular disease, she was diagnosed with isolated cecal ischemia, an extremely rare presentation of acute colonic ischemia.Although the exact cause remains unclear, most cases are of nonocclusive origin,1,2 a variant of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, in which a low-flow state results in splanchnic vasoconstriction as blood flow is preferentially diverted to essential organs. It is associated with critical illness and cardiovascular disease. Occlusive causes are rarer and predominantly attributable to large arterial atherosclerotic disease with distal thromboembolism (spontaneous or after vascular procedures), cardiac arrhythmias with embolism of atrial thrombus, small arterial disease in patients with diabetes, or venous outflow obstruction from hypercoagulable states.3 Resultant segmental ischemia often occurs at watershed areas. The cecum may also represent a watershed area4 owing to its end arterial supply from the anterior and posterior cecal arteries. In most patients, there is dual arterial inflow from a vascular arcade that bridges the ileal and colic branches of the ileocolic artery5; however, the rare anatomical variant of a singular inflow off the colic branch may predispose these patients to ischemia.6 The appendix, terminal ileum, and ascending colon have multiple arterial sources, which may explain why these are at lesser risk of ischemia.Isolated cecal ischemia most commonly manifests as acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, leukocytosis, and nonspecific imaging findings of cecal wall thickening with adjacent fat stranding. It is frequently misdiagnosed as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or infectious colitis.7 A high index of suspicion is warranted, especially in elderly patients, those who are critically ill, or patients with atrial dysrhythmias or atherosclerotic disease. In addition, prompt imaging with intravenous contrast enhancement is important to evaluate for colonic ischemia. Caution is advised with colonoscopy because of the risk of perforation of a thin-walled ischemic cecum from increased intraluminal pressure.8 Mortality rates are high, and timely diagnosis is key to prevent rapid patient death.After the diagnosis is established, prompt surgical resection of the ischemic segment is crucial, although the role of primary anastomosis vs end ileostomy remains in debate.9,10 Schuler and Hudlin10 described 5 patients with isolated cecal necrosis: 4 had mucosal necrosis and underwent primary anastomosis, and 1 had transmural necrosis with perforation and underwent end ileostomy. Only the patients undergoing primary anastomosis survived. Çakar et al2 described 6 patients with transmural necrosis; half underwent primary anastomosis and the other half end ileostomy. Five patients underwent a second-look operation within 48 hours; all patients who had an initial anastomosis had evidence of staple-line ischemia and required another resection with end ileostomy. We advocate for end ileostomy in transmural necrosis; however, primary anastomosis may be considered if necrosis is limited to the mucosa when close examination of the patient is performed postoperatively.After initiation of fluid resuscitation, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and a heparin drip, the patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy. A 10 × 10–cm area of full-thickness cecal necrosis was identified with a normal appendix, terminal ileum, and ascending colon. An ileocecectomy was performed. Her renal function normalized postoperatively. The results of laboratory studies and findings of transesophageal echography were negative for a hypercoagulable cause or embolic source. Despite transition to dual antiplatelet therapy, 4 weeks postoperatively, the patient developed recurrent abdominal pain and melena with midtransverse colonic ischemia seen on imaging.

Arrowheads indicate the nonseptate broad-branching hyphae.Mucormycosis comprises fungal infections of the class Zygomycota and the order Mucorales. Rhizopus species represent the most frequently isolated causative organism that microscopically appears as nonseptate, broad-branching hyphae. These organisms are omnipresent in nature and are rarely pathogenic in immunocompetent patients.Mucormycosis is a medical emergency that presents opportunistically in patients with immunosuppression, neutropenia, and hyperglycemia.1 Mucormycosis has angioinvasive capacity, leading to vascular thrombosis that results in tissue infarction.2 Tissue infarction manifests as a hyperemic, violaceous, or black cutaneous plaque. Infections that involve the nasal, sinus, orbital, and brain tissues are characteristic and confer a high mortality rate. Clinical signs include fever, nasal ulceration or necrosis, periorbital swelling, sinusitis, or headache.3 Mortality from mucormycosis varies on the degree of involvement. A systematic review4 of 929 cases of mucormycosis found a mortality rate of 46% among patients with sinus involvement, 76% among those with pulmonary involvement, and 96% for disseminated infection.High-risk newborns, patients with hematologic malignant tumors, and patients with congenital metabolic abnormalities constitute risk factors frequently seen in the pediatric population.5,6 The most common pattern of presentation of pediatric mucormycosis is cutaneous, followed by gastrointestinal, rhinocerebral, and pulmonary. Thirty-two percent of all cases are disseminated.5 Cutaneous mucormycosis usually results from direct inoculation of spores into traumatized dermis but can also be from intravenous catheter placement, injections, and surgery.7Leukemia cutis presents as firm red-brown nodules and is more likely to occur in acute myelogenous leukemia than in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rapidly progressive neutrophilic dermatosis that presents with cutaneous ulceration with a violaceous border and undermined edges. Brown recluse spider bites result in painful hemorrhagic bullae surrounded by erythema that may be associated with nausea, myalgia, and diaphoresis. In the setting of neutropenia and a dark painless plaque, an opportunistic infection, such as mucormycosis, should be suspected.Pediatric mucormycosis portends a poor prognosis. Roilides et al8 reported a mortality of 64% in neonates and 56% in children. Both disseminated infection and age younger than 1 year were independent risk factors for mortality. Successful treatment of pediatric mucormycosis relies on a timely diagnosis and expedited treatment.Dermatologic consultation for suspected mucormycosis should include skin biopsies for permanent and frozen section histologic analysis and tissue cultures. Liposomal amphotericin B is first-line treatment for disseminated mucormycosis infection, and posaconazole may be used as step-down therapy.6 The recommended prophylactic antifungal agent for pediatric patients undergoing bone marrow transplant is fluconazole, which has unreliable activity against mucormycosis.

Mucormycosis,D,Mucormycosis,"Histologic sections from the lesional skin revealed nonseptate broad-branching fungal hyphae within and occluding dermal vessels, confirming angioinvasive mucormycosis (Figure 2A and B). Cutaneous and sinus tissue cultures similarly yielded Mucorales species, reflecting a disseminated angioinvasive mucormycosis infection. Imaging results were negative for pulmonary invasion. Combination antifungal therapy with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B, posaconazole, and micafungin was initiated, and excision was undertaken. Induction therapy was reinstated 24 days later.A, Punch biopsy specimen from the left lower back (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×10). Note the dermal necrosis and infiltrative hyphae. Arrowheads indicate the nonseptate broad-branching hyphae. B, Punch biopsy specimen from the left lower back (periodic acid–Schiff stain, original magnification ×20). Arrowheads indicate the nonseptate broad-branching hyphae.Mucormycosis comprises fungal infections of the class Zygomycota and the order Mucorales. Rhizopus species represent the most frequently isolated causative organism that microscopically appears as nonseptate, broad-branching hyphae. These organisms are omnipresent in nature and are rarely pathogenic in immunocompetent patients.Mucormycosis is a medical emergency that presents opportunistically in patients with immunosuppression, neutropenia, and hyperglycemia.1 Mucormycosis has angioinvasive capacity, leading to vascular thrombosis that results in tissue infarction.2 Tissue infarction manifests as a hyperemic, violaceous, or black cutaneous plaque. Infections that involve the nasal, sinus, orbital, and brain tissues are characteristic and confer a high mortality rate. Clinical signs include fever, nasal ulceration or necrosis, periorbital swelling, sinusitis, or headache.3 Mortality from mucormycosis varies on the degree of involvement. A systematic review4 of 929 cases of mucormycosis found a mortality rate of 46% among patients with sinus involvement, 76% among those with pulmonary involvement, and 96% for disseminated infection.High-risk newborns, patients with hematologic malignant tumors, and patients with congenital metabolic abnormalities constitute risk factors frequently seen in the pediatric population.5,6 The most common pattern of presentation of pediatric mucormycosis is cutaneous, followed by gastrointestinal, rhinocerebral, and pulmonary. Thirty-two percent of all cases are disseminated.5 Cutaneous mucormycosis usually results from direct inoculation of spores into traumatized dermis but can also be from intravenous catheter placement, injections, and surgery.7Leukemia cutis presents as firm red-brown nodules and is more likely to occur in acute myelogenous leukemia than in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rapidly progressive neutrophilic dermatosis that presents with cutaneous ulceration with a violaceous border and undermined edges. Brown recluse spider bites result in painful hemorrhagic bullae surrounded by erythema that may be associated with nausea, myalgia, and diaphoresis. In the setting of neutropenia and a dark painless plaque, an opportunistic infection, such as mucormycosis, should be suspected.Pediatric mucormycosis portends a poor prognosis. Roilides et al8 reported a mortality of 64% in neonates and 56% in children. Both disseminated infection and age younger than 1 year were independent risk factors for mortality. Successful treatment of pediatric mucormycosis relies on a timely diagnosis and expedited treatment.Dermatologic consultation for suspected mucormycosis should include skin biopsies for permanent and frozen section histologic analysis and tissue cultures. Liposomal amphotericin B is first-line treatment for disseminated mucormycosis infection, and posaconazole may be used as step-down therapy.6 The recommended prophylactic antifungal agent for pediatric patients undergoing bone marrow transplant is fluconazole, which has unreliable activity against mucormycosis. Evidence supporting the use of posaconazole in this role is increasingly promising.9 Treatment of mucormycosis is most effective when surgical debridement is combined with intravenous antifungal therapy.6",Oncology,"On day 15 of induction therapy with intravenous cytarabine, vincristine sulfate, dexamethasone, pegaspargase, and intrathecal methotrexate, a 3-year-old child with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented to the oncology department with an asymptomatic skin lesion. No known skin trauma occurred. The patient was afebrile, and vital signs were stable. On examination, a 4.0 × 2.0-cm, oval-shaped violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla and surrounding hyperemia was noted on the left lower back (Figure 1). A complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 1800/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), with 2% neutrophils (absolute neutrophil count, 36/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), and platelet count of 10 × 103/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1).

She had extensive rituals involving washing her hands repeatedly and cleaning household items. She reported, “I wash everything anyone else touches…I hardly let anyone into our home, and if I do, I wash down furniture and often have to wash the floors.” She avoided handling groceries, mail, and money and would not visit with family members owing to concerns that they were contaminated.She had experienced OCD symptoms since age 10 years but did not formally receive a diagnosis until 10 years later. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) resulted in little benefit even at maximum doses (eg, 400 mg of fluvoxamine daily, 200 mg of sertraline daily). A trial of clomipramine up to 250 mg daily also failed to reduce her OCD symptoms.

Randomized clinical trials indicate that ERP is (1) more effective than credible control interventions (eg, relaxation),1 (2) superior to monotherapy with clomipramine,3 and (3) superior to risperidone augmentation of an SSRI or clomipramine.4 Owing to potential adverse effects with SSRIs, practice guidelines recommend ERP as the first-line treatment for mild, uncomplicated OCD.5 However, because ERP is challenging, approximately 19% of patients with access to ERP refuse treatment or drop out prematurely.6While serotonergic medications have been the primary pharmacologic treatment for patients with OCD, evidence suggests that glutamatergic abnormalities may play a role in OCD7 (as discussed further by Dougherty et al2). Consequently, glutamate-modulating medications, such as memantine, riluzole, and the supplement N-acetylcysteine, have been investigated as potential OCD treatments generally to augment an SSRI or clomipramine. Data from these trials are inconsistent, but these interventions may benefit a subset of patients with OCD. The preliminary nature of these findings relegates these medications to third-line treatments behind conventional psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic approaches.For the small fraction of patients who have persistent, impairing OCD symptoms after evidence-based medical and psychological treatment, it may be reasonable to consider brain stimulation and/or surgical approaches that directly modulate the corticostriatal circuits believed to underlie OCD.2 Growing evidence suggests a potential role for transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of OCD when applied to these brain circuits.8 However, the modest sample sizes of recent studies limits definitive conclusions about efficacy and the optimal cortical targets for OCD. More investigation is needed before transcranial magnetic stimulation can be considered a standard OCD treatment.Patients with severe, treatment-refractory OCD may be helped by invasive surgical treatments such as capsulotomy and cingulotomy, both of which have response rates of 50% to 70% with minimal long-term cognitive adverse effects.9 Gamma knife radiosurgery has been used to replicate open capsulotomy with comparable results.9 Deep brain stimulation (DBS), the newest neurosurgical treatment for OCD, applies high-frequency electrical pulses to the white matter of the ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum at a site very close to the capsulotomy target.10 On the basis of open-label data, DBS is currently available for management of OCD under a Humanitarian Device Exemption from the Food and Drug Administration.9The patient received approximately 45 weekly ERP sessions but was unable to maintain benefits outside of ERP meetings.

Bronchopulmonary sequestration,B,Bronchopulmonary sequestration,"Computed tomography performed at 9 months of age confirmed a bronchopulmonary sequestration with a feeding vessel originating from the thoracic aorta. Results of elective thoracoscopy showed adhesions from previous fetal and postnatal interventions and allowed for resection of the sequestration (Video).Bronchopulmonary sequestrations are congenital malformations of the lung that can be intralobar (within the lung) or extralobar (contained within a separate pleura). They are characterized by an anomalous blood supply, most commonly originating from a branch of the thoracic or abdominal aorta (Figure 2).1 Bronchopulmonary sequestrations are distinguished from congenital pulmonary airway malformations by the absence of a connection with the tracheobronchial tree and the presence of an anomalous systemic artery.Thoracoscopic view of feeding vessel (arrow) from aorta to bronchopulmonary sequestration.The natural course of sequestrations has become more evident with prenatal surveillance and the development of fetal interventions. Prenatal diagnosis is often made via ultrasonography with the aid of color Doppler to visualize the anomalous artery.2 If the vessel is not visible, magnetic resonance imaging of the fetus may aid in diagnosis. Initial evaluation should include assessment for concomitant congenital anomalies.2Sequestrations diagnosed antenatally may be asymptomatic, may lead to a hydrothorax with or without hydrops, or may regress spontaneously.3,4 Many are not identified until later in life. Older children may present with an infection or pneumothorax or the sequestration may be discovered incidentally on imaging.1The origins of nonimmune fetal hydrops are numerous, making identification of an underlying thoracic cause important given the opportunity for intervention. For congenital lung masses associated with fetal hydrothorax and hydrops, thoracoamniotic shunting should be performed because hydrops associated with bronchopulmonary sequestration is otherwise fatal.5,6 A pleural effusion present at birth may need to be drained with tube thoracostomy. Symptomatic infants require early intervention or surgical resection; those with asymptomatic lesions should undergo follow-up imaging with elective thoracoscopic resection.5,7",Surgery,"A pregnant woman in her late 30s had normal findings on anatomic ultrasonography at 19 weeks’ gestation.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed an inhomogeneous nodule in the subcutaneous layer with a largest diameter of approximately 5 cm. No enlarged lymph nodes were detectable in the groin. Results of a complete blood cell count and levels of alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were unremarkable. An ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy was performed, and histopathologic evaluation showed the aspects of a small round-cell tumor, which was confirmed to be a Ewing sarcoma by immunohistochemical and molecular analysis (with positivity for the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene [OMIM 133450]). The patient then underwent disease staging with computed tomography (CT) of the chest and whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The CT findings were negative for secondary lesions; the FDG-PET scan demonstrated, as expected, high uptake in the right thigh (maximum standard uptake variable [SUVmax], 8.4) at the site of the subcutaneous tumor and at a second lesion in the left ankle joint (SUVmax, 12.0). The patient reported vague pain around the left ankle but no functional limitations and no history of trauma at that site. A radiograph of the ankle did not show calcifications within the soft-tissue lesion.

Ganglion cysts appear with a homogeneous high-intensity T2-weighted signal and do not show central contrast enhancement or high uptake on FDG-PET. Synovial sarcoma is a rare soft-tissue tumor that is intra-articular only in about 10% of the cases. This tumor usually shows an inhomogeneous high-intensity signal on T2-weighted MRI scans. A similar radiologic presentation would also be expected in case of a soft-tissue metastasis from an Ewing sarcoma, which is a rare event.1 Synovial sarcoma shows calcifications within the tumor in approximately 30% of cases.Excisional biopsy confirmed TGCT. The patient underwent treatment for a localized ES manifesting at an unusual site: the subcutis.Tenosynovial giant cell tumor, also known as pigmented villonodular synovitis, is a benign, proliferative inflammatory disease involving joints, bursae, and tendon sheaths. This disease can manifest as a single nodule, the localized type, or as an extensive synovial proliferation with villous and nodular shapes, the diffuse form.2 Although symptoms are not always directly associated with the extension of disease, diffuse-type TGCT usually causes pain, stiffness, secondary osteoarthritis, and reduced quality of life, whereas patients with localized TGCT are often asymptomatic.2,3The diagnosis of TGCT is mainly based on the combination of clinical and radiologic presentation, and histologic confirmation is not always required. Appearance on MRI is relatively specific, and thus this examination is essential in the diagnostic workup. The lesion is typically intra-articular and appears as an inhomogeneous mass with low- to intermediate-intensity signal on T1- and T2-weighted images. The low-intensity T2-weighted signal is attributable to hemosiderin deposits within the pathologic tissue. The diffuse type shows numerous solid nodules or villi along the synovium and is often associated with a large joint effusion. In long-standing lesions, bone erosions, extension outside the joint, and secondary arthritis often occur.4From literature data, TGCT shows consistently increased uptake in FDG-PET in the localized and diffuse types owing to its highly active inflammatory component, with SUVmax values ranging from 4.0 to 17.0 (Figure 2).5 Therefore, this disease can be easily mistaken for a malignant neoplasm, for example when FDG-PET is performed for staging, as in the current case. Owing to the routine use of FDG-PET as a staging study, reports of incidental findings of TGCTs mimicking malignant neoplasms are becoming more frequent.6,7Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography in a patient with Ewing sarcoma show high uptake of contrast material (maximum standard uptake variable [SUVmax], 8.4) in the right thigh (black arrowhead) and a second area (SUVmax, 12.0) in the left ankle (red arrowhead).Surgical excision of the pathologic tissue is the standard treatment of TGCT and is usually curative for the localized form. In the diffuse type, multiple and invasive surgical procedures often lead to significant adverse effects and the risk for recurrence is high.3 Radiotherapy or radiosynovectomy have been proposed as alternatives but are also associated with adverse effects and poor local control. Therefore, during the past few years, interest in potential target treatments for diffuse-type TGCT has increased, especially since the finding of overexpression of colony-stimulating factor 1 in this neoplasm.8 Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including small molecules and antibodies against colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, are currently under investigation and have shown promising results in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.9,10 In the near future, FDG-PET might become a useful tool to assess the metabolic response to these potential new treatments.",Oncology,"An adolescent girl presented with a 3-month history of a growing, painless mass in the right thigh.

The patient was initially diagnosed with MDS 3 years ago and treated with azacitidine followed by CLAG (cladribine, cytarabine, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor). Posttreatment bone marrow biopsy findings at that time showed no evidence of disease. His physical examination on this presentation showed multiple dark brown cutaneous papules measuring at 3.0 to 5.0 cm (Figure, A), but the rest of the examination results were negative for hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy.

Cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm,C,Cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare clonal disorder comprising 0.7% of cutaneous lymphomas.1 Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is categorized as an independent entity to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)2 and it may occur as an isolated disease or in the presence of other hematologic malignant abnormalities including AML, MDS, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in 10% to 20% of cases.1 Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm typically occurs in the elderly population (median age, 60-70 years), and it is more common in men (2.5-3.5:1.0).3Although BPDCN can involve any body site including lymph node, spleen, and liver, the most common sites are skin and bone marrow.4 Accordingly, patients commonly present with cutaneous lesions as brown or purple nodules (73%), bruise-like patches (12%), disseminated or mixed lesions (14%).4 Cytopenia (thrombocytopenia, 78%; anemia, 65%; neutropenia, 34%) is common in the presence of bone marrow involvment.4 Overt leukemia with circulating BPDCN cells could be the first manifestation in advanced cases.4Cutaneous lesions in BPDCN may mimic lesions of leukemia cutis, cutaneous CMML, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or Langerhans cell histiocytosis, rendering it a diagnostic challenge. Notably, BPDCN typically show dense dermal infiltration of small-to-medium sized immature cells with plasmacytoid appearance and elongated cytoplasmic tails. Results of immunohistochemical analyses are typically positive for CD4, CD56, CD45RA, CD123, TCL1, BDCA-2, TCF-4/E2-2, and BDCA-4, and results for CD3, CD11c, CD14, CD19, CD57, CD117, and myeloperoxidase are negative. Results for CD8, CD20, CD34, PAX5, Epstein-Barr virus, and T-cell receptor proteins are uniformly negative.The pathogenesis of BPDCN and its relationship to other hematologic disorders remain elusive. Its immunophenotypic resemblance to plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) and higher proliferation index suggest that BPDCN originates from PDCs. Recent genetic studies demonstrated BPDCN shares many mutations in common (TET2, 80%; ASXL1, 32%; NRAS, 27.3%; TP53) with other myeloid disorders,5 and abnormal karyotypes such as 5q, 6q, 12p, 13q, and 15q have been reported in 50% to 65% of cases.6The clinical outcome of BPDCN remains dismal, with median overall survival (OS) of 12 to 14 months.3 Advanced age is an adverse prognostic factor, and no survival difference was observed between cutaneous vs systemic BPDCN.7 There is no standard care established given its rarity. A retrospective study3 showed that regimens for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas such as hyper-CVAD (including course A [cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone] and course B [methotrexate and cytarabine]) or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) had superior outcomes compared with AML regimens (66.6% vs 26.9% complete remission [CR] rate; P = .02; median OS, 12.3 vs 7.1 months; P = .02). Therefore, ALL-like induction chemotherapies are recommended along with central nervous system prophylaxis or therapy. A recent phase 2 clinical trial of SL-401, a recombinant interleukin 3 genetically fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin, demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 95%, a CR of 79%, and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.5 months in the front-line setting, enabling successful bridging to allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) in 44% of patients.8 Disease relapse is common (median relapse time 9 months) regardless of types of treatments.4 Therefore, allo-SCT is recommended in patients who achieve CR/partial response after induction therapies. In a large retrospective study, 3-year OS rate was 41% in patients treated with allo-SCT, and there was no relapse observed 27 months after allo-SCT, suggesting that allo-SCT could be potentially curative.9 Another study10 showed significantly higher 3-year OS rate (74% vs 0%, P < .001) in patients who received allo-SCT in their first CR vs not in CR1, further emphasizing the benefit of allo-SCT. The optimal therapy for refractory/relapsed BPDCN is poorly defined. The SL-401 study showed an ORR of 69%, a CR rate of 31%, and median PFS 3.6 months in the refractory/relapsed settings.8 Currently, a variety of agents including BCL-2 inhibitors are under clinical development.This patient was treated with hyper-CVAD with complete resolution of skin lesions; however, the patient developed disease relapse and was subsequently treated with SL-401. Unfortunately, he had progression of disease and died after further chemotherapies.",Oncology,"A white man in his 50s with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 2 (RAEB-2) or MDS with excess blasts, type 2 (MDS-EB-2) RAEB-2 reported a 2-month history of nonpruritic infiltrative skin lesions on the left upper chest, which disseminated to the entire chest, back, and right facial areas (Figure, A).

In a large retrospective study, 3-year OS rate was 41% in patients treated with allo-SCT, and there was no relapse observed 27 months after allo-SCT, suggesting that allo-SCT could be potentially curative.9 Another study10 showed significantly higher 3-year OS rate (74% vs 0%, P < .001) in patients who received allo-SCT in their first CR vs not in CR1, further emphasizing the benefit of allo-SCT. The optimal therapy for refractory/relapsed BPDCN is poorly defined. The SL-401 study showed an ORR of 69%, a CR rate of 31%, and median PFS 3.6 months in the refractory/relapsed settings.8 Currently, a variety of agents including BCL-2 inhibitors are under clinical development.This patient was treated with hyper-CVAD with complete resolution of skin lesions; however, the patient developed disease relapse and was subsequently treated with SL-401.

Cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm,C,Cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare clonal disorder comprising 0.7% of cutaneous lymphomas.1 Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is categorized as an independent entity to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)2 and it may occur as an isolated disease or in the presence of other hematologic malignant abnormalities including AML, MDS, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in 10% to 20% of cases.1 Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm typically occurs in the elderly population (median age, 60-70 years), and it is more common in men (2.5-3.5:1.0).3Although BPDCN can involve any body site including lymph node, spleen, and liver, the most common sites are skin and bone marrow.4 Accordingly, patients commonly present with cutaneous lesions as brown or purple nodules (73%), bruise-like patches (12%), disseminated or mixed lesions (14%).4 Cytopenia (thrombocytopenia, 78%; anemia, 65%; neutropenia, 34%) is common in the presence of bone marrow involvment.4 Overt leukemia with circulating BPDCN cells could be the first manifestation in advanced cases.4Cutaneous lesions in BPDCN may mimic lesions of leukemia cutis, cutaneous CMML, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or Langerhans cell histiocytosis, rendering it a diagnostic challenge. Notably, BPDCN typically show dense dermal infiltration of small-to-medium sized immature cells with plasmacytoid appearance and elongated cytoplasmic tails. Results of immunohistochemical analyses are typically positive for CD4, CD56, CD45RA, CD123, TCL1, BDCA-2, TCF-4/E2-2, and BDCA-4, and results for CD3, CD11c, CD14, CD19, CD57, CD117, and myeloperoxidase are negative. Results for CD8, CD20, CD34, PAX5, Epstein-Barr virus, and T-cell receptor proteins are uniformly negative.The pathogenesis of BPDCN and its relationship to other hematologic disorders remain elusive. Its immunophenotypic resemblance to plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) and higher proliferation index suggest that BPDCN originates from PDCs. Recent genetic studies demonstrated BPDCN shares many mutations in common (TET2, 80%; ASXL1, 32%; NRAS, 27.3%; TP53) with other myeloid disorders,5 and abnormal karyotypes such as 5q, 6q, 12p, 13q, and 15q have been reported in 50% to 65% of cases.6The clinical outcome of BPDCN remains dismal, with median overall survival (OS) of 12 to 14 months.3 Advanced age is an adverse prognostic factor, and no survival difference was observed between cutaneous vs systemic BPDCN.7 There is no standard care established given its rarity. A retrospective study3 showed that regimens for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas such as hyper-CVAD (including course A [cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone] and course B [methotrexate and cytarabine]) or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) had superior outcomes compared with AML regimens (66.6% vs 26.9% complete remission [CR] rate; P = .02; median OS, 12.3 vs 7.1 months; P = .02). Therefore, ALL-like induction chemotherapies are recommended along with central nervous system prophylaxis or therapy. A recent phase 2 clinical trial of SL-401, a recombinant interleukin 3 genetically fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin, demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 95%, a CR of 79%, and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.5 months in the front-line setting, enabling successful bridging to allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) in 44% of patients.8 Disease relapse is common (median relapse time 9 months) regardless of types of treatments.4 Therefore, allo-SCT is recommended in patients who achieve CR/partial response after induction therapies.

Genetic testing following an episode of hypoglycemia revealed microdeletion of the 16p11.2 region of chromosome 16. His pediatrician documented a normal neurological examination without dysmorphology or congenital anomalies.A developmental evaluation revealed delays in motor function and language development notable by age 2 years. He attended a 0 to 3 program with intensive speech therapy and then moved to a self-contained preschool classroom with a 1:1 staff-to-student ratio. He received school-based speech, occupational, and physical therapies. Testing results revealed clinically significant scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Cognitive testing results showed that his IQ was below average but was likely an underestimate due to noncompliance. The parents stated that he played repetitively, lining up toy cars and spinning their wheels. He did not seek or give comfort to others when distressed. He had tactile hypersensitivity but pain hyposensitivity, flicked light switches repetitively, and mouthed objects.In the office, the patient showed a minimal response to clinicians’ social overtures and poor eye contact. He replayed videos on a smartphone while laughing, spinning around, and flapping his hands. He did not respond to prompts for joint engagement and no imaginative play was observed. When the videos stopped, he repeatedly climbed onto chairs and jumped off. As clinicians attempted to redirect him, he became very agitated and his mother intervened physically to protect him from self-injury.Referral of family members for genetic testing to determine 16p11.2 carrier statusPharmacotherapy with R-baclofen based on the mouse model of 16p11.2 deletionPharmacotherapy with citalopram for rigidity and repetitive behaviorReferral to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for irritability, agitation, and self-injury What Would You Do Next?",Referral of family members for genetic testing to determine 16p11.2 carrier status,Pharmacotherapy with R-baclofen based on the mouse model of 16p11.2 deletion,Pharmacotherapy with citalopram for rigidity and repetitive behavior,"Referral to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for irritability, agitation, and self-injury","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (associated with chromosome 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, level 3 severity, with accompanying intellectual and language impairment) and global developmental delay",D,"Referral to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for irritability, agitation, and self-injury","Children with aggression and self-injury are frequently referred to child psychiatrists for management of acute behavioral issues.

He also has at least 2 identifiable risk factors for a neurodevelopmental disorder: (1) premature birth and (2) 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.A careful medical evaluation in collaboration with his other clinicians ruled out medical problems that would account for his behavior. His behavior had been quite consistent over the past year and there were no recent psychosocial stressors. In the absence of other medical, psychiatric, or psychosocial factors, his behaviors most likely relate to the diagnosis of ASD with outbursts secondary to (1) deficient communication and (2) decreased tolerance for change and frustration.Behavioral intervention is first-line treatment for aggressive behavior in young children, and therapy based on the principles of applied behavior analysis has extensive empirical support in ASD. Several treatment models exist, including standard applied behavior analysis , pivotal response training, and the Early Start Denver Model. Parallel parent-training components can provide additional benefits. A functional behavioral assessment to identify triggers and understand the function of the behavior can help implement a behavioral intervention plan to decrease the target behavior, in this case, aggression and self-injury. While this patient benefitted from school-based therapies, he had not yet received applied behavior analysis –specific or other behavioral therapies at the time of evaluation. Unfortunately, access to behavioral interventions is often limited by a scarcity of trained clinicians.It is critical to evaluate the immediate safety concerns of each patient and determine whether the risk of injury to the patient or others justifies a trial of a medication to reduce the risk of injury.1 In these cases, medications should be carefully considered. Atypical antipsychotic medications have the best evidence for treating aggression and self-injurious behavior in children with ASD. Based on multiple randomized clinical trials,2 risperidone and aripiprazole were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of “irritability associated with autistic disorder” in children as young as 5 and 6 years old, respectively. The “irritability” target symptom definition was based on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability/Agitation/Crying subscale, which indexes aggression and self-injury as well as tantrums, crying, mood swings, and irritability. In any child, symptoms must be substantial to merit using this medication in the context of the potential adverse effects, which include sedation and an increased risk for movement disorders. Mixed receptor antagonists, such as risperidone and aripiprazole, are also associated with substantial weight gain and related medical problems, including type 2 diabetes. The addition of metformin has shown efficacy in reducing weight gain in children with ASD who are taking risperidone or aripiprazole.3 Some genetic conditions (including chromosome 16p11.2 deletion syndrome) are also associated with an increased risk of obesity,4 and aripiprazole may therefore be preferred over risperidone. While multiple lines of evidence point to abnormalities of the serotonin system in ASD, serotonin reuptake inhibitors do not show the same pattern of benefit in children with ASD that they provide in obsessive compulsive disorder; for example, a large randomized clinical trial of citalopram for repetitive behavior in ASD showed no overall significant benefits and increased adverse effects.5Autism spectrum disorder is an extremely heterogeneous disorder that appears to be a common final outcome of several factors, including genetic risk alleles, environmental insults, and developmental events.6 While chromosomal microarray testing can identify a clinically relevant genetic change in up to 10% of people with autism,7 in most cases we do not yet have evidence-based guidelines to clinically act on these findings. For these individuals (and those with idiopathic ASD), treatments target behavioral symptoms, such as the irritability and agitation experienced by this child.Our patient had a perinatal risk factor (prematurity) and a genetic risk factor (16p11.2 microdeletion). While there is a markedly increased risk for ASD in 16p11.2 microdeletion carriers, most do not receive a diagnosis of ASD. 16p11.2 deletion carriers are phenotypically diverse (and overlap with the nonclinical population), and they are at risk for several other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as obesity.8 Family members should always be offered genetic counseling and testing to assess whether they are carriers and to assess the recurrence risk of ASD in any siblings.The finding of a rare genomic variant in this patient could eventually open the door to a precision medicine treatment approach based on studies of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. As an illustration, mouse models of 16p11.2 deletion suggest that the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor agonist R-baclofen may improve behavior.6,9 R-baclofen affects inhibition by gamma-aminobutyric acid, which is postulated to contribute to the pathophysiology of ASD via excessive excitatory or insufficient inhibitory neurotransmission. A randomized clinical trial of R-baclofen in the general ASD population did not show improvement in irritability and agitation symptoms, although suggestive results on 2 other measures may merit a follow-up study.10",Psychiatry,"A 4-year-old boy was referred to the child psychiatry clinic for management of tantrums with aggression and self-injurious behavior.

Testicular cancer,B,Testicular cancer,"Results of percutaneous biopsy of the intraperitoneal mass subsequently revealed tumor cells with uniform vesicular hyperchromatic nuclei and clear cytoplasm, with positive staining for placental alkaline phosphatase, CD117 (proto-oncogene c-Kit), and OCT4 (octamer-binding transcription factor 4), suggestive of seminomatous germ cell origin. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIB seminoma testicular cancer. Testicular cancer commonly affects males between the ages of 15 and 35 years, and is the most common solid tumor among males in this age range.1 It accounts for 1% of all cancers in men, with 95% of cases presenting as germ cell tumors.1 Cryptorchidism increases the risk of testicular cancer: in a meta-analysis,2 the pooled relative risk of testicular cancer in men with isolated cryptorchidism was 2.9. The treatment options for germ cell tumors differ between seminomatous and nonseminomatous subtypes. Seminoma is highly treatable, with cure rates exceeding 90% for all stages combined.1 The staging of testicular cancer is done in accordance with the 2017 joint staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union for International Cancer Control.3 For patients with advanced disease, prognostic tools by the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group may be used for risk stratification, prognostication, and selection of appropriate systemic therapy.4 In metastatic seminomatous germ cell tumors, patients may have a good or intermediate risk profile based on the location of the metastases. Those with an intermediate risk profile harbor metastasis to visceral organs other than the lungs or lymph nodes.This patient was diagnosed with metastatic seminoma in the good risk category. As such, the recommended treatment option is cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. The standard treatment regimen is 3 cycles of bleomycin sulfate, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP)5 or 4 cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EP).6 Trials conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Genitourinary Tract Cancer Cooperative Group5 and Groupe d’Etude des Tumeurs Uro-Genital comparing 3 cycles of BEP with 4 cycles of EP7 showed that the EP cohort had similar survival outcomes, but possibly slightly inferior, when treating individuals with a good risk profile. Etoposide and cisplatin should be considered for men with compromised pulmonary function and/or compromised renal function. In men with metastatic seminomas who had a good risk profile, the 5-year progression-free survival rate was 90% and the overall survival rate was 92%.4After systemic therapy, the primary site of the germ cell tumor in the testicle should be removed if not previously done, as the testicular blood barrier impairs effective penetration of chemotherapeutic agents into the testicular parenchyma. There is no role for radiotherapy for metastatic seminomas.This patient received 3 cycles of BEP cytoreductive chemotherapy, with good response. The large intraperitoneal heterogenous mass with calcifications became significantly smaller, measuring 9.8 × 16.7 cm in its transverse diameter. There was also interval resolution of the left supraclavicular adenopathy and left inguinal lymph node. Both the lactate dehydrogenase and β human chorionic gonadotrophin levels normalized after chemotherapy. The patient subsequently underwent laparoscopic left testicular orchidectomy for the residual tumor (Figure 2), and results of histologic testing showed no residual viable disease.",Surgery,"A man in his 30s presented with abdominal pain associated with unintentional weight loss for 6 months.

The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIB seminoma testicular cancer. Testicular cancer commonly affects males between the ages of 15 and 35 years, and is the most common solid tumor among males in this age range.1 It accounts for 1% of all cancers in men, with 95% of cases presenting as germ cell tumors.1 Cryptorchidism increases the risk of testicular cancer: in a meta-analysis,2 the pooled relative risk of testicular cancer in men with isolated cryptorchidism was 2.9. The treatment options for germ cell tumors differ between seminomatous and nonseminomatous subtypes. Seminoma is highly treatable, with cure rates exceeding 90% for all stages combined.1 The staging of testicular cancer is done in accordance with the 2017 joint staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union for International Cancer Control.3 For patients with advanced disease, prognostic tools by the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group may be used for risk stratification, prognostication, and selection of appropriate systemic therapy.4 In metastatic seminomatous germ cell tumors, patients may have a good or intermediate risk profile based on the location of the metastases. Those with an intermediate risk profile harbor metastasis to visceral organs other than the lungs or lymph nodes.This patient was diagnosed with metastatic seminoma in the good risk category. As such, the recommended treatment option is cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. The standard treatment regimen is 3 cycles of bleomycin sulfate, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP)5 or 4 cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EP).6 Trials conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Genitourinary Tract Cancer Cooperative Group5 and Groupe d’Etude des Tumeurs Uro-Genital comparing 3 cycles of BEP with 4 cycles of EP7 showed that the EP cohort had similar survival outcomes, but possibly slightly inferior, when treating individuals with a good risk profile. Etoposide and cisplatin should be considered for men with compromised pulmonary function and/or compromised renal function. In men with metastatic seminomas who had a good risk profile, the 5-year progression-free survival rate was 90% and the overall survival rate was 92%.4After systemic therapy, the primary site of the germ cell tumor in the testicle should be removed if not previously done, as the testicular blood barrier impairs effective penetration of chemotherapeutic agents into the testicular parenchyma.

He was otherwise asymptomatic and had no physical limitations. He had never smoked, and results of his physical examination were normal. Results of complete blood cell counts, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests were all within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed a 10 × 9-cm lobulated left lower lobe mass. Examination of a biopsy specimen showed a primary adenocarcinoma with an immunohistochemical profile of CDX2 positive, CK20 positive, TTF-1 negative, and napsin A negative. His EGFR (OMIM 131550), ALK (OMIM 105590), and ROS1 (OMIM 165020) genes were wild type, and results of testing for programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) were 0%.

Positron emission tomography showed no evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy or extrathoracic disease. Given the patient’s excellent performance status, he underwent a mediastinoscopy with left lower lobe lobectomy. Results of postoperative pathologic testing showed a 13-cm adenocarcinoma with similar immunohistochemical markers as in the prior biopsy specimen.

Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEA),B,Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEA),"This pathologic specimen revealed an adenocarcinoma with immunohistochemical staining identical to that of colorectal adenocarcinoma. Positron emission tomography and upper and lower endoscopy did not reveal any evidence of colorectal malignant neoplasm or pathologic lymphadenopathy. Thus, the diagnosis of PEA was made.Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma is a histopathologic diagnosis defined as a primary non–small cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLC) with intestinal differentiation. Patients present with pulmonary-predominant lesions without evidence of gastrointestinal malignant neoplasm at workup.1,2 There are approximately 50 cases of PEA described in the literature that immunohistochemically compared PEA, NSCLC, and metastatic colorectal cancer.1,3 Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma shares the same immunohistochemical markers used to distinguish metastatic colorectal cancer and NSCLC, including CDX2 and CK20, which are characteristic of metastatic colorectal cancer.3,4Management can pose a dilemma for the oncologist in deciding to treat PEA as a gastrointestinal tract or lung primary malignant neoplasm, because their treatments and prognoses differ. Although the presentation of PEA is well described, few reports describe treatment response. One case report showed a partial response and progression-free survival of 4 months with adjuvant docetaxel and cisplatin therapy.5 Despite the histologic similarity of PEA to metastatic colorectal cancer, PEA may not respond well to typical colorectal chemotherapy regimens such as fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin or gemcitabine.5To reduce the risk of recurrence, the patient was treated with adjuvant docetaxel and cisplatin for 4 cycles, which was well tolerated. Six months later, he developed a new 3.9 × 3.2-cm left adrenal gland mass and nodules in the right middle lobe (0.9 × 0.7 cm) and right lower lobe (1.5 × 1.4 cm). The patient remained asymptomatic at that time. Examination of biopsy specimens of the adrenal mass showed similar morphologic characteristics and immunohistochemical profile as the prior left lower lobe malignancy.Given the progression of the patient’s condition after adjuvant chemotherapy, nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as second-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC irrespective of PD-1 staining percentage, was initiated. Stereotactic body radiotherapy was also initiated for the left adrenal mass. There is evidence that radiotherapy-associated tumor injury releases antigens that lead to a more aggressive immune response when using immune checkpoint inhibitors.6 Results of subsequent imaging 3 months later demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe nodules. The patient’s adrenal mass had decreased significantly to 1.4 × 1.0 cm. Since initiation of nivolumab, the patient has demonstrated greater than 14 months of durable response.Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma represents a unique manifestation of treatment-refractory NSCLC that has had a remarkable durable response with immune checkpoint inhibition. For metastatic NSCLC in particular, PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors have become a center point of discussion. In approximately 20% of patients, these responses can last more than 12 months, as was noted in this patient.7 However, the strength of PD-1 and PD-L1 staining correlation does not adequately estimate response. In fact, up to 19% of individuals with negative PD-1 and PD-L1 staining respond to nivolumab.7,8 The current literature suggests that that the tumor microenvironment and mutational burden are important and may explain the efficacy of treatment in the patient. Biopsy specimens demonstrating high inflammatory white cell infiltration 1 to 2 months after nivolumab therapy have been shown to be associated with excellent response.9 Mutational burden and microsatellite instability may also explain immune response.9,10 Next-generation sequencing genomic testing performed on the PEA biopsy specimen did not show microsatellite instability, although results were remarkable for intermediate mutational burden with 8 significant mutations including TP53 (OMIM 191170) and CCND1 (OMIM 168461).This patient with PEA represents a unique NSCLC phenotype that continues to have durable response of greater than 14 months with nivolumab therapy despite a low PD-1 expression. We suggest that immunotherapy may have a significant efficacious role in the treatment of PEA owing to its mutational burden.",Oncology,"A man in his 60s presented with a 1-year history of a mild, dry cough.

Hemorrhagic shock secondary to perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis,B,Hemorrhagic shock secondary to perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis,"The computed tomographic scan demonstrated calculi within the gallbladder and surrounding hyperemia indicative of cholecystitis. Additionally, there was active extravasation into the distended gallbladder associated with hemorrhagic ascites. The constellation of findings on the scan, his presentation, and examination findings were most consistent with acute perforated hemorrhagic cholecystitis. This patient was promptly taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy; Figure 2 clearly shows an inflamed gallbladder with a perforated wall.Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with grasper on cystic duct and instrument retracting liver. Perforation was noted in the gallbladder wall adjacent to the liver with hemorrhagic contents.Cholelithiasis is an extremely common diagnosis in Americans, affecting approximately 20% of the population, one-third of whom will go on to develop cholecystitis.1 However, both hemorrhagic cholecystitis and perforated cholecystitis are uncommon. Gallbladder perforation due to ischemia and gangrene occurs in only 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis and is associated with a mortality rate of up to 70%.2 Case reports of hemorrhagic cholecystitis are most consistently associated with malignancy or bleeding diathesis but can be related to obstructive cholecystitis, trauma, percutaneous interventions, or parasites. Diagnosis of hemorrhagic cholecystitis can be difficult because the presentation can range from a simple cholecystitis to acute abdomen pain. Prompt diagnosis is necessary to avoid significant morbidity and mortality.3-5Although there are, to our knowledge, no randomized studies or case series published on perforated hemorrhagic cholecystitis, most case reports recommend evaluating with ultrasonography or computed tomography if there is concern for this pathology. However, it should be noted that it can be difficult to see perforation on ultrasonography. There are several studies6,7 that emphasize the utility of computed tomography in the setting of complications of acute cholecystitis. Computed tomography also offers several distinct advantages over ultrasonography, including widespread availability, speed of imaging, lack of operator dependence, and increased anatomical coverage.5,6 Most reports agree that cholecystectomy is the appropriate treatment.After correction of coagulopathy and packed red blood cell transfusion, the patient was taken to the operating room to proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively, there was evidence of gallbladder perforation with active bleeding through the perforation, and greater than 1 L of blood clot was found intra-abdominally. Pathology revealed acute on chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis and a full-thickness gallbladder perforation.

In adult T cell leukemia lymphoma, the antibody against human T-lymphotropic virus 1 is found in the blood. Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) subtype and is considered extranodal indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma with T-cell origin. Mycosis fungoides accounts for 54% of the CTCLs and almost 4% of cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States. Its incidence is higher in men and black patients, with the incidence rate increasing with age.1 Clinically, MF presentation mimics other dermatological conditions, making the diagnosis challenging at early stages.2 Given the difficulty of MF diagnosis, a diagnostic algorithm was developed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer to help in establishing the diagnosis. This point-based algorithm takes into account 4 aspects: clinical, histopathologic, molecular biological, and immunopathologic features. A total of 4 points is needed to establish the diagnosis of MF.3This patient’s skin lesions started as small patches and plaques, progressed to exfoliative lesions, then to nodules. Histopathologic findings were positive for upper dermal atypical lymphoid infiltrate. Molecular testing showed positive TRG gene rearrangement. Immunopathologic testing showed T cells from multiple nodular aggregates with expression of CD2, CD4, and CD5. Her stage was IIIB.The cause of MF is ill defined, though theories suggest underlying genetic predisposition with environmental triggers.4 Patients usually have similar symptoms to other inflammatory dermatological conditions such as psoriasis, chronic dermatitis, and vitiligo.4 Mycosis fungoides usually affects multiple areas simultaneously and generally affect body parts not exposed to the sun. The lesion of MF might present as patches, plaques, or tumors, which are the most common cutaneous manifestations, or generalized erythroderma. Poikiloderma is a more distinct but rare variant of MF. These lesions may increase in size and coalesce, affecting more surface areas. As in this patient, topical and/or oral steroids are effective in early-stage MF, which may confuse the diagnosis with other dermopathies, delaying diagnosis for a long time.5Diagnosis of early-stage MF is not only challenging clinically but also histopathologically. Several pathological features observed in MF can also be seen in other inflammatory diseases. Examples of those features include the following: haloed lymphocytes, Pautrier abscesses, disproportional exocytosis, and lymphocytes aligned within the basal layer. Haloed lymphocytes are considered the most suggestive of MF.6 The most substantial prognostic factors in the survival rate of MF are patient age at presentation; T, N, and B classifications; overall clinical stage; and the presence or absence of extracutaneous disease.7 The preferred method of treatment in early stage MF is skin-directed therapy, which includes topical corticosteroids, ultraviolet B, combination treatment consisting of Psoralens and then exposure of the skin to ultraviolet A, localized radiotherapy, and mechlorethamine. For more advanced stages, systemic therapy is indicated.8 This patient received multiple therapies in adjunct with radiotherapy, including bexarotene, which was discontinued because of allergic adverse effects; vorinostat, which resulted in worsening of the patient’s underlying epilepsy; and romidepsin, which resulted in resolved skin lesions (Figure 2).Clinical photograph of resolved skin lesions on the head and neck.Romidepsin is one of the histone deacetylase inhibitors that are approved for the treatment of MF, with an overall response rate of 34%.9 This case illustrates the importance of identifying indolent CTCLs, mainly MF, and offering patients new treatments if previous regimens fail.

The T cell receptor γ gene (TRG) rearrangement analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative.The plaques and nodules worsened over a 6-month period, becoming more numerous and increasing in thickness, especially on the face, and early leonine facies developed (Figure 1B). The results from analysis of a second biopsy specimen showed dense band-like lymphoid infiltrate in the superficial dermis with mild epidermotropism. As her condition continued to worsen, a third biopsy specimen was obtained, and the result was consistent with the suspected diagnosis.

Mycosis fungoides,C,Mycosis fungoides,"The papules in lymphomatoid papulosis are characterized by the presence of central necrosis and crusting. Lesions subside by discontinuing the causative drug in reactive lymphomatoid reaction where TRG gene rearrangement is always negative. In adult T cell leukemia lymphoma, the antibody against human T-lymphotropic virus 1 is found in the blood. Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) subtype and is considered extranodal indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma with T-cell origin. Mycosis fungoides accounts for 54% of the CTCLs and almost 4% of cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States. Its incidence is higher in men and black patients, with the incidence rate increasing with age.1 Clinically, MF presentation mimics other dermatological conditions, making the diagnosis challenging at early stages.2 Given the difficulty of MF diagnosis, a diagnostic algorithm was developed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer to help in establishing the diagnosis. This point-based algorithm takes into account 4 aspects: clinical, histopathologic, molecular biological, and immunopathologic features. A total of 4 points is needed to establish the diagnosis of MF.3This patient’s skin lesions started as small patches and plaques, progressed to exfoliative lesions, then to nodules. Histopathologic findings were positive for upper dermal atypical lymphoid infiltrate. Molecular testing showed positive TRG gene rearrangement. Immunopathologic testing showed T cells from multiple nodular aggregates with expression of CD2, CD4, and CD5. Her stage was IIIB.The cause of MF is ill defined, though theories suggest underlying genetic predisposition with environmental triggers.4 Patients usually have similar symptoms to other inflammatory dermatological conditions such as psoriasis, chronic dermatitis, and vitiligo.4 Mycosis fungoides usually affects multiple areas simultaneously and generally affect body parts not exposed to the sun. The lesion of MF might present as patches, plaques, or tumors, which are the most common cutaneous manifestations, or generalized erythroderma. Poikiloderma is a more distinct but rare variant of MF. These lesions may increase in size and coalesce, affecting more surface areas. As in this patient, topical and/or oral steroids are effective in early-stage MF, which may confuse the diagnosis with other dermopathies, delaying diagnosis for a long time.5Diagnosis of early-stage MF is not only challenging clinically but also histopathologically. Several pathological features observed in MF can also be seen in other inflammatory diseases. Examples of those features include the following: haloed lymphocytes, Pautrier abscesses, disproportional exocytosis, and lymphocytes aligned within the basal layer. Haloed lymphocytes are considered the most suggestive of MF.6 The most substantial prognostic factors in the survival rate of MF are patient age at presentation; T, N, and B classifications; overall clinical stage; and the presence or absence of extracutaneous disease.7 The preferred method of treatment in early stage MF is skin-directed therapy, which includes topical corticosteroids, ultraviolet B, combination treatment consisting of Psoralens and then exposure of the skin to ultraviolet A, localized radiotherapy, and mechlorethamine. For more advanced stages, systemic therapy is indicated.8 This patient received multiple therapies in adjunct with radiotherapy, including bexarotene, which was discontinued because of allergic adverse effects; vorinostat, which resulted in worsening of the patient’s underlying epilepsy; and romidepsin, which resulted in resolved skin lesions (Figure 2).Clinical photograph of resolved skin lesions on the head and neck.Romidepsin is one of the histone deacetylase inhibitors that are approved for the treatment of MF, with an overall response rate of 34%.9 This case illustrates the importance of identifying indolent CTCLs, mainly MF, and offering patients new treatments if previous regimens fail. In such patients with refractory skin involvement or extracutaneous disease, enrollment in a clinical trial of novel agents is appropriate.",Oncology,"A patient in them 20s previously prescribed and currently taking valproic acid and phenytoin for epilepsy presented to the clinic with a 2-month history of gradually worsening pruritic plaques that initially involved the scalp, face, and neck, and later affected the anterior and posterior chest wall, abdomen, upper arms, and thighs; they also had nodules over the nose and cheeks (Figure 1A).Clinical photographs show (A) nodules on the head and neck on presentation and (B) nodules of of increasing thickness after 6 months.It was thought that they developed exfoliative dermatitis secondary to valproic acid and phenytoin.

Advanced desmoplastic small round cell tumor,D,Advanced desmoplastic small round cell tumor,"Histopathologic analysis revealed islands and nests of uniform small round cells with round hyperchromatic nuclei and minimal cytoplasm embedded in a prominent fibroblastic stroma characteristic of desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT). Immunoprofile showed varying degrees of epithelial, muscle, and neural marker expressions. Results of FISH yielded pathognomonic EWSR1-WT1 fusion oncogene that results from t(11;22)(p13;q12) translocation.1Desmoplastic small round cell tumor is a rare and highly fatal soft tissue sarcoma of mesenchymal origin that was first described by Gerald and Rosai in 1989.2 Etiology of DSRCT remains uncertain. The name DSRCT derives from its characteristic histologic findings of clusters of small round blue cells surrounded by abundant desmoplastic stroma. It is a disease of pediatric and young adult patients with peak incidence from 20 to 24 years and is more common in men.3 Patients usually present with nonspecific abdominal symptoms, such as distension, pain, discomfort, and constipation. Most patients have advanced disease at presentation evidenced by imaging findings of large abdominal masses and peritoneal implants with ascites.4Contrast-enhanced CT scan is the initial imaging study of choice. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be considered for detailed delineation of pelvic and hepatic lesions.4 Positron emission tomography scan can detect occult lesions, including pelvic and cervical lymph nodes perhaps missed by CT and MRI.5 Multiple disseminated abdominopelvic masses with a large dominant lesion is the common presenting finding, whereas solitary well-defined abdominal mass is rare.5,6 Ascites can be present in 35% of cases.6 More than half of patients have metastatic disease at presentation with liver, lungs, pleura, and mediastinum being the common locations,4,6 whereas cervical, lymph nodes, and bone are rare.6 Approximately 50% of patients have thoracoabdominal lymphadenopathies.6Biopsy is often performed for tissue diagnosis. However, for solitary intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal mass, particularly in suspected sarcoma, surgical resection should be performed without biopsy to prevent tumor seeding. Desmoplastic small round cell tumor frequently has diffuse abdominopelvic involvement; thus, conventional sarcoma staging may not be useful for prognosis and treatment decision. Therefore, a new staging system4 is being proposed, although it is not yet validated, as follows:Stage 1: tumor localized to 1 or 2 sites in the abdomen or 1 site elsewhere.Stage 2: presence of extensive peritoneal disease.Stage 3: involving peritoneal disease and liver metastasis.Stage 4: additional disease outside the abdominal cavity, including lymph nodes.Stage 1: tumor localized to 1 or 2 sites in the abdomen or 1 site elsewhere.Stage 3: involving peritoneal disease and liver metastasis.Stage 4: additional disease outside the abdominal cavity, including lymph nodes.Desmoplastic small round cell tumor is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which has poor prognosis despite multimodality treatments. It is extremely rare; thus, recommendations are based on level 2 and 3 clinical data, which may be debatable. Surgery is the preferred initial approach in patients with solitary lesion, however, most patients have advanced disease at presentation and are always treated with multiagent intensive chemotherapy. This is followed by maximal surgical debulking with or without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, then adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.4 Kushner et al7 developed a P6 chemotherapy regimen that includes cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and etoposide. Owing to its high toxicity, a more tolerable alternative regimen was used for this patient, which comprises neoadjuvant vincristine, ifosfamide, dexrazoxane, doxorubicin, and etoposide and adjuvant irinotecan plus temozolomide.4 Combined with surgical and radiation modalities, this regimen yielded disease-free interval of approximately 2 years.4 Addition of irinotecan, temozolomide, and bevacizumab to P6 chemotherapy regimen in newly diagnosed patients is proven to be effective without notable additional toxic effects.8Adjuvant total abdominal radiotherapy has considerable hematological and gastrointestinal toxic effects. Although intensity-modulated radiation therapy has reduced these toxic effects, it is associated with suboptimal disease-free survival.4 Myeloablative therapy with autologous stem cell rescue following debulking surgery is ineffective.9 Intraperitoneal radioimmunotherapy with 131I-8H9 has promising preliminary results.4 Additional newer approaches include poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 and 2 inhibitors (PARPi), trabectedin, and agents targeting mTOR and androgen receptor pathways.4,10",Oncology,"A man in his 20s presented with a 2-month history of vague, right upper-quadrant abdominal pain, with associated 5-kg weight loss, loss of appetite, and increasing abdominal distension.

The name DSRCT derives from its characteristic histologic findings of clusters of small round blue cells surrounded by abundant desmoplastic stroma. It is a disease of pediatric and young adult patients with peak incidence from 20 to 24 years and is more common in men.3 Patients usually present with nonspecific abdominal symptoms, such as distension, pain, discomfort, and constipation. Most patients have advanced disease at presentation evidenced by imaging findings of large abdominal masses and peritoneal implants with ascites.4Contrast-enhanced CT scan is the initial imaging study of choice. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be considered for detailed delineation of pelvic and hepatic lesions.4 Positron emission tomography scan can detect occult lesions, including pelvic and cervical lymph nodes perhaps missed by CT and MRI.5 Multiple disseminated abdominopelvic masses with a large dominant lesion is the common presenting finding, whereas solitary well-defined abdominal mass is rare.5,6 Ascites can be present in 35% of cases.6 More than half of patients have metastatic disease at presentation with liver, lungs, pleura, and mediastinum being the common locations,4,6 whereas cervical, lymph nodes, and bone are rare.6 Approximately 50% of patients have thoracoabdominal lymphadenopathies.6Biopsy is often performed for tissue diagnosis. However, for solitary intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal mass, particularly in suspected sarcoma, surgical resection should be performed without biopsy to prevent tumor seeding. Desmoplastic small round cell tumor frequently has diffuse abdominopelvic involvement; thus, conventional sarcoma staging may not be useful for prognosis and treatment decision. Therefore, a new staging system4 is being proposed, although it is not yet validated, as follows:Stage 1: tumor localized to 1 or 2 sites in the abdomen or 1 site elsewhere.Stage 2: presence of extensive peritoneal disease.Stage 3: involving peritoneal disease and liver metastasis.Stage 4: additional disease outside the abdominal cavity, including lymph nodes.Stage 1: tumor localized to 1 or 2 sites in the abdomen or 1 site elsewhere.Stage 3: involving peritoneal disease and liver metastasis.Stage 4: additional disease outside the abdominal cavity, including lymph nodes.Desmoplastic small round cell tumor is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which has poor prognosis despite multimodality treatments. It is extremely rare; thus, recommendations are based on level 2 and 3 clinical data, which may be debatable. Surgery is the preferred initial approach in patients with solitary lesion, however, most patients have advanced disease at presentation and are always treated with multiagent intensive chemotherapy. This is followed by maximal surgical debulking with or without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, then adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.4 Kushner et al7 developed a P6 chemotherapy regimen that includes cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and etoposide. Owing to its high toxicity, a more tolerable alternative regimen was used for this patient, which comprises neoadjuvant vincristine, ifosfamide, dexrazoxane, doxorubicin, and etoposide and adjuvant irinotecan plus temozolomide.4 Combined with surgical and radiation modalities, this regimen yielded disease-free interval of approximately 2 years.4 Addition of irinotecan, temozolomide, and bevacizumab to P6 chemotherapy regimen in newly diagnosed patients is proven to be effective without notable additional toxic effects.8Adjuvant total abdominal radiotherapy has considerable hematological and gastrointestinal toxic effects. Although intensity-modulated radiation therapy has reduced these toxic effects, it is associated with suboptimal disease-free survival.4 Myeloablative therapy with autologous stem cell rescue following debulking surgery is ineffective.9 Intraperitoneal radioimmunotherapy with 131I-8H9 has promising preliminary results.4 Additional newer approaches include poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 and 2 inhibitors (PARPi), trabectedin, and agents targeting mTOR and androgen receptor pathways.4,10",Oncology,"A woman in her 20s presented with a 2-month history of vague, right upper-quadrant abdominal pain, with associated 5-kg weight loss, loss of appetite, and increasing abdominal distension.

2262,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2659373,"A woman in her 80s with a history of recurrent oral cancer presented with a new, biopsy-confirmed, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Her oncologic history began 16 years ago with diagnosis and local resection of a lesion on the palate. Cancer recurrence at the left buccal mucosa was identified and excised 10 years later. She then was diagnosed with 3 recurrences of SCC in rapid succession. Each malignant neoplasm was locally resected and the patient was also treated with adjuvant radiotherapy for the last episode. She remained asymptomatic, and a routine surveillance clinical examination uncovered a sixth lesion at the margin of a palatal graft.The patient’s medical history was also noted for a total thyroidectomy in the 1950s, complicated by recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. She had a history of tobacco use and stopped smoking cigarettes in the 1970s. Physical examination and laryngoscopy findings confirmed a painless lesion on the left side of the palate and immobility of the left vocal cord. No other mucosal lesion was identified. Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed to assess extent of disease and to plan treatment. The PET scan results showed focal fludeoxyglucose F 18 localization within the known oral cavity SCC (Figure 1A) and in a small, level IIA lymph node, located lateral to the upper right internal jugular vein. There was unexpected, prominent, metabolic activity in the medial and asymmetrically enlarged left vocal cord (Figure 1B).A, Positron emission tomography reveals focal fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake in biopsy-confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the left palatal graft margin (arrowhead). B, Increased metabolic activity in the left vocal cord (arrowhead).Primary laryngeal carcinoma in the setting of extensive, recurrent head and neck SCC What Is Your Diagnosis?",Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma,"Primary laryngeal carcinoma in the setting of extensive, recurrent head and neck SCC",Inflammatory reaction,Postradiation change,C. Inflammatory reaction,C,Inflammatory reaction,"The inflammatory reaction is caused by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)–based (Teflon; The Chemours Company) injection augmentation. Given this patient’s extensive head and neck oncologic history, which includes 6 temporally separate SCC lesions, the hypermetabolic activity of the prominent left vocal cord initially generated concern for a malignant neoplasm. Establishing an accurate diagnosis involved extensive review of the history and previous imaging studies. The patient sustained paralysis of the left vocal cord following a thyroidectomy procedure and subsequently received PTFE-based injection augmentation.Computed tomography of the neck (Figure 2) showed unchanged medialization, expansion, and hyperdensity of the left vocal cord when compared with a computed tomographic scan performed 10 months earlier at an outside institution. Laryngoscopy results showed an immobilized left glottis without a focal mucosal lesion to suggest malignant neoplasm. Radiotherapy changes would be unlikely because they typically appear more diffuse in the neck region, and this patient’s radiotherapy port from previous adjuvant treatment did not include the glottis. The focal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake imaging seen on PET scan is consistent with the diagnosis of PTFE-induced granuloma. This inflammatory response is described as a multinuclear, foreign-body, giant cell reaction.1Axial computed tomography at the level of the glottis confirms a medially positioned, asymmetrically enlarged, and hyperdense left vocal cord (arrowhead) that was unchanged from prior imaging.This case underscores the importance of clinical history in the evaluation of laryngeal pathologic changes. Vocal cord paralysis without a history of prior surgery in this region would necessitate the use of fiber-optic laryngoscopy and radiologic imaging. In contrast, investigation of the cause of postsurgical vocal cord pathologic changes can be shaped by information available about prior treatment and the status of current disease. For this patient, the vocal cord findings were chronic, radiologically stable, and visualized at the PTFE injection site.

He was previously healthy and had no prior abdominal operations. The patient noted pencil-thin stools that occurred during the past several months but had not had a colonoscopy in more than a decade. The rest of his history was noncontributory. He was mildly tachycardic but normotensive and afebrile. Physical examination revealed a lethargic patient with a distended abdomen, diffuse rebound tenderness, and involuntary guarding. No surgical scars or inguinal hernias were apparent on examination. The only abnormal laboratory values were as follows: sodium concentration, 126 mEq/L (reference range, 135-145 mEq/L) (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1); lactate concentration, 58.6 mg/dL (reference range, 0-18.0 mg/dL) (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111); and white blood cell count, 18 500/μL (reference range, 3400-10 000/μL) (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). He was resuscitated with 2 L of lactated Ringer solution and underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast. Computed tomography revealed diffuse free fluid but without free air and several loops of dilated small bowel with thickened, hypoenhancing bowel walls. The mesentery was markedly edematous (Figure). The rest of the small bowel were dilated and air and fluid filled but had normal bowel wall enhancement. The colon was normal.Axial computed tomography image of the abdomen and pelvis.

Mesenteric venous thrombosis,C,Mesenteric venous thrombosis,"Acute mesenteric venous thrombosis has an estimated incidence of 2.7 per 100 000 population.1 Its origin is multifactorial and can be divided into acquired vs inherited conditions. Localized inflammatory processes, such as infection, trauma, pancreatitis, or tumor leading to compression or invasion into surrounding structures, may increase the risk of mesenteric venous thrombosis that affects predominantly the larger veins. If cirrhosis and solid organ neoplasms, the most common underlying causes, have been ruled out, diagnostic studies for thrombophilia and myeloproliferative disorders should performed.2 Nonoperative treatment for mesenteric venous thrombosis centers around anticoagulation along with treatment of the underlying process.3Patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis may also be diagnosed with a myeloproliferative neoplasm 8% to 18% of the time, although a previous study4 found rates as high as 40%. Among patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm and mesenteric venous thrombosis, polycythemia vera (PV) is the most common cause (27.5%), followed by essential thrombocytosis (26.2%) and primary myelofibrosis (12.8%).2 Polycythemia vera is an acquired stem cell disorder characterized by erythroid proliferation independent of erythropoietin-mediated growth factor signaling. The JAK2 (OMIM 147796) V617F mutation is found in 96% of patients with PV and is a major criterion in the World Health Organization criteria for the diagnosis of PV.5,6Arterial or venous thrombotic events are potentially devastating clinical features in patients with PV. The hypercoagulability associated with PV is mediated by increased blood viscosity and complex platelet-leukocyte interactions, manifesting in multiple vascular beds as mesenteric thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, coronary events, and cerebral vascular accidents.7Patients presenting with progressively worsening abdominal pain and distension, involuntary guarding, or peritonitis should be evaluated for ischemic bowel. With radiographic evidence of splanchnic vein thrombosis and no clinical history of malignant tumor or previous diagnosis of hypercoagulability, testing for thrombophilia markers should begin concomitantly with preparation for surgery. Care should be taken to also resect any ischemic bowel or any bowel associated with thrombosed mesentery. The extent of resection depends on the patency of mesenteric vessels that perfuse the 2 resection ends. This patency can be investigated using manual palpation of a mesenteric pulse, observing bleeding at the cut edges, intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography, or indocyanine green angiography if available. Determination of vascular patency is of paramount importance in patients who present with new-onset thromboses. An additional exploration should be planned in 24 to 36 hours if there are any doubts regarding bowel viability. A hand-sewn anastomosis should be considered for 2 segments that have discrepant luminal diameter attributable to venous congestion. Finally, an intravenous heparin infusion should begin as soon as postoperative hemostasis is determined.

Spontaneous perinephric hematoma,B,Spontaneous perinephric hematoma,"The CT scan revealed an acute large left perinephric hematoma with multiple foci of active hemorrhage (Figure 1A). The spleen was mildly enlarged, and was without evidence of rupture. The abdominal aorta was well visualized without evidence of aneurysm dilatation or rupture.

A 3.5 × 2.7-cm Bosniak I cyst was initially demonstrated in the left kidney at the initial CT scan2 (Figure 1B). We postulate that a spontaneous cyst rupture occurred, and the concurrent administration of ibrutinib contributed to a bleeding diathesis that led to development of a large perinephric hematoma.3Following these events, treatment with ibrutinib was stopped, and the patient was started on rituximab and bortezomib. There were no further episodes of bleeding from the left kidney, and she did not require additional blood transfusions. The platelet and white blood cell counts normalized, and the patient was discharged 8 days later.Ibrutinib is a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated in the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma, and has been associated with a good tolerability profile.4 It is also effective therapy against chronic lymphocytic leukemia,5 small lymphocytic lymphoma,6 and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.7 Spontaneous bleeding has been reported with ibrutinib, and is most commonly related to grade 1 and grade 2 hemorrhagic adverse events in the cutaneous system (petechiae, ecchymoses). The incidence of these events have been reported in up to 50% of patients, especially those requiring concurrent antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. However, up to 3% of patients may experience major bleeding in the viscera (≥grade 3), especially after trauma.4 In a phase III trial comparing ofatumumab and ibrutinib for the treatment of chronic lymphoid leukemia, there was 1 case of a grade 3 and grade 4 hemorrhage (subdural hematoma), respectively.8 This trial had excluded patients who required warfarin but not other forms of anticoagulation.The bleeding diathesis associated with ibrutinib is likely to be related to selective inhibition of platelet signaling and function necessary for collagen-induced platelet aggregation and activation. It also decreases firm platelet adhesion on von Willebrand factor under physiological arterial blood flow, thereby leading to accentuated bleeding in specific conditions, such as trauma.3,9 The thrombocytopenia observed at clinical presentation is likely to be related to consumption from bleeding. This is supported by the subsequent normalization of the platelet counts with angiographic hemostasis.To our knowledge, this is the first report of a perinephric hematoma arising from a rupture of a simple renal cyst and leading to a grade 4 hemorrhagic adverse event. According to current guidelines, interruption of ibrutinib monotherapy is recommended if grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxic effects, grade 3 or higher neutropenia with infection or fever, or grade 4 hematologic toxic effects occur.10Spontaneous perinephric hematomas are rare, and are usually caused by benign renal tumors (angiomyolipomas), vascular abnormalities, or other disorders, such as a rupture of a renal artery aneurysm. The clinical symptoms can range from mild flank and/or abdominal pain in minor cases to acute cardiovascular collapse in major bleeding episodes. A strong clinical judgement is required so that early axial imaging with CT can facilitate a prompt and precise diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening condition.

During the 2-month period that she was receiving ibrutinib therapy, there were no concurrent administrations of anticoagulants. At presentation, she was hypotensive (blood pressure, 79/45 mm Hg) with conjunctival pallor and left renal angle tenderness. The patient’s hemoglobin count was low (7.6 g/dL; reference range, 12-16 g/dL; to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), which represented a significant decrease from the baseline (10.6 g/dL) measured 1 month before presentation. She was also found to have acute-onset thrombocytopenia (40×109/L; reference range, 140-400×109/L) and leukocytosis (12.75×109/L, reference range, 4-10×109/L). Her coagulation profile (prothrombin time) was normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed (Figure 1A) and compared with a similar scan performed 4 months prior (Figure 1B).

Spontaneous perinephric hematoma,B,Spontaneous perinephric hematoma,"The CT scan revealed an acute large left perinephric hematoma with multiple foci of active hemorrhage (Figure 1A). The spleen was mildly enlarged, and was without evidence of rupture. The abdominal aorta was well visualized without evidence of aneurysm dilatation or rupture. The patient underwent left renal arterial embolization, following hemodynamic stabilization with a transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells and 1 unit of platelets (Figure 2).A, Bleeding demonstrated at the lower pole vascular of the left kidney. B, Postembolisation angiogram showing hemostasis (coils introduced into lower pole artery). A 3.5 × 2.7-cm Bosniak I cyst was initially demonstrated in the left kidney at the initial CT scan2 (Figure 1B). We postulate that a spontaneous cyst rupture occurred, and the concurrent administration of ibrutinib contributed to a bleeding diathesis that led to development of a large perinephric hematoma.3Following these events, treatment with ibrutinib was stopped, and the patient was started on rituximab and bortezomib. There were no further episodes of bleeding from the left kidney, and she did not require additional blood transfusions. The platelet and white blood cell counts normalized, and the patient was discharged 8 days later.Ibrutinib is a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated in the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma, and has been associated with a good tolerability profile.4 It is also effective therapy against chronic lymphocytic leukemia,5 small lymphocytic lymphoma,6 and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.7 Spontaneous bleeding has been reported with ibrutinib, and is most commonly related to grade 1 and grade 2 hemorrhagic adverse events in the cutaneous system (petechiae, ecchymoses). The incidence of these events have been reported in up to 50% of patients, especially those requiring concurrent antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. However, up to 3% of patients may experience major bleeding in the viscera (≥grade 3), especially after trauma.4 In a phase III trial comparing ofatumumab and ibrutinib for the treatment of chronic lymphoid leukemia, there was 1 case of a grade 3 and grade 4 hemorrhage (subdural hematoma), respectively.8 This trial had excluded patients who required warfarin but not other forms of anticoagulation.The bleeding diathesis associated with ibrutinib is likely to be related to selective inhibition of platelet signaling and function necessary for collagen-induced platelet aggregation and activation. It also decreases firm platelet adhesion on von Willebrand factor under physiological arterial blood flow, thereby leading to accentuated bleeding in specific conditions, such as trauma.3,9 The thrombocytopenia observed at clinical presentation is likely to be related to consumption from bleeding. This is supported by the subsequent normalization of the platelet counts with angiographic hemostasis.To our knowledge, this is the first report of a perinephric hematoma arising from a rupture of a simple renal cyst and leading to a grade 4 hemorrhagic adverse event. According to current guidelines, interruption of ibrutinib monotherapy is recommended if grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxic effects, grade 3 or higher neutropenia with infection or fever, or grade 4 hematologic toxic effects occur.10Spontaneous perinephric hematomas are rare, and are usually caused by benign renal tumors (angiomyolipomas), vascular abnormalities, or other disorders, such as a rupture of a renal artery aneurysm. The clinical symptoms can range from mild flank and/or abdominal pain in minor cases to acute cardiovascular collapse in major bleeding episodes. A strong clinical judgement is required so that early axial imaging with CT can facilitate a prompt and precise diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening condition. The options for definitive treatment include renal arterial embolization, or surgical intervention (nephrectomy).",Oncology,"A patient in them 50s presented to the emergency department with acute, severe, left flank pain.

Lupus enteritis,C,Lupus enteritis,"The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. A rheumatology consultation was obtained, and she was given intravenous methyprednisolone, 1000 mg daily, for 4 days. The patient’s abdominal pain improved within 8 hours of methyprednisolone administration, and by hospital day 2, she was tolerating a diet of solid food.Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune-mediated chronic inflammatory disease with the potential to affect every organ system.1 Systemic lupus erythematosus affects the hematologic, renal, and central nervous systems most commonly, and presentations can be variable.1 Enteritis is a relatively rare sequela of systemic lupus erythematosus, typically presenting with signs and symptoms similar to those of mesenteric ischemia, with pain out of proportion to the findings on physical examination.2 In some studies, lupus enteritis is referred to as the most frequent possible cause of abdominal pain in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus2; alternatively, in other studies, lupus enteritis is cited as a relatively rare cause of abdominal pains, illustrating our lack of knowledge about this disease secondary to its relative rarity.3 Laboratory test findings are nonspecific and usually positive only for inflammatory markers.4 Computed tomography scans demonstrate severe bowel wall thickening (ie, target sign). Mesenteric fat stranding and engorged mesenteric vessels are also commonly observed.5 Bladder wall thickening is frequently found on CT scans. The patient also presented with a moderate degree of ascites.Given the grave findings on CT scans, lupus enteritis can appear on cursory glance to resemble mesenteric ischemia but is lacking the large vessel thrombosis and/or occlusion seen in that disease.5 Prompt recognition of lupus enteritis is key to preventing the sequelae of perforation, obstruction, or necrosis.Management of lupus enteritis consists of prompt administration of immunologic suppression, usually consisting of pulse doses of corticosteroids.4 Several practitioners have reported positive outcomes using alternative methods of immunosuppression such as cyclophosphamide. These are considered second-line therapies in cases in which corticosteroids have failed or are contraindicated.4,6 Patients usually respond well to immunosuppression, as was seen in our case, with complete resolution of abdominal pain within hours.Vigilant surgical attention is warranted for early recognition of clinical deterioration. Despite the relative paucity of literature on lupus enteritis, the pendulum has shifted from early surgical intervention toward medical management in the absence of absolute indications for surgical intervention such as bowel necrosis or perforation.There have been reports of the recurrence of lupus enteritis being associated with the degree of initial bowel wall thickening or the involvement of the urinary tract.7,8 Lymphopenia, elevated amylase, and hypoalbuminemia are reported to be associated with poorer outcomes.9In conclusion, lupus enteritis, while relatively rare, is an important diagnosis to consider for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus presenting with severe abdominal pain. Given the profound findings on CT scans, it is often the consultant surgeon determining the treatment for these patients. With appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, potentially morbid diagnostic operations can be avoided.9",Surgery,"A patient in them 50s with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, congestive heart failure, and type 2 diabetes presented to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain 1 day after discharge from an admission for similar abdominal pain.

Rupture of a jejunal artery aneurysm,C,Rupture of a jejunal artery aneurysm,"Patients with hemodynamic instability and generalized peritonitis or clinical deterioration with acute abdominal pain are usually experiencing one of a few intra-abdominal catastrophes: severe pancreatitis, ruptured abdominal aneurysm, bowel infarction, or digestive juices or sepsis release from perforation of a peptic ulcer or other gastrointestinal abnormality. Diagnosis always relies on imaging evaluation; when dealing with clinically deteriorating patients, computed tomography has the advantage of providing rapid, sensitive, and specific results.1 This patient’s CECT image showing high-attenuation fluid (34 HU) in the perihepatic and perisplenic regions (Figure 1) and his sudden onset of abdominal pain and anemia establish a diagnosis of intraperitoneal hemorrhage. With a normal serum amylase level, the clinical features and imaging results eliminated the diagnoses of pancreatitis and perforated peptic ulcer. Numerous specific computed tomographic signs of hemoperitoneum associated with a high-attenuation hematoma or sentinel clot, mesenteric fluid, and active arterial extravasation may indicate the source of bleeding and help direct management.2 The CECT images in this patient demonstrated the presence of a small area of hyperdense vessels, suggesting active bleeding with a large peripancreatic hematoma (Figure 1A). The CT finding of active bleeding indicated that endovascular management or surgical treatment should be considered. A selective superior mesenteric artery injection revealed vascular sclerosis and a 7-mm aneurysm of the distal branch of the first jejunal artery (Figure 1B).Jejunal artery aneurysms are rare, accounting for less than 3% of all splanchnic artery aneurysms,3 which have recognized morbid potential because of their tendency to rupture. Jejunal artery aneurysms have a 30% risk of rupture with a 20% death rate.

2424,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2648732,"A 62-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with severe substernal pain radiating to the left shoulder and back and subsequent swelling of the left side of her neck. She had been recently treated at an outpatient facility for a viral illness with multiple episodes of forceful coughing. There was no recent history of trauma to the neck or chest.Physical examination revealed normal vital signs and soft tissue swelling over the left supraclavicular area. No overlying skin changes or crepitus were appreciated. Laboratory data revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 18 000/µL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001). A computed tomographic scan demonstrated extensive edema of the left neck, with fat stranding seen in the subcutaneous tissues extending into the left jugular, carotid, and esophageal spaces (Figure, A). Mediastinal edema and bilateral pleural effusions were also seen on computed tomographic scan (Figure, B). Owing to the concern for esophageal perforation, a barium swallow was performed, showing no extravasation of contrast.A, Computed tomographic scan shows extensive soft tissue inflammation in the left neck (arrowhead). B, Computed tomographic scan shows bilateral pleural effusions (red arrowheads) and mediastinal edema (white arrowhead). What Is Your Diagnosis?",Acute jugular thrombosis,Spontaneous chylothorax,Contained esophageal perforation,Descending necrotizing mediastinitis,B. Spontaneous chylothorax,B,Spontaneous chylothorax,"Ultrasonography-guided left thoracentesis yielded milky fluid. Laboratory analysis confirmed chylothorax, with triglyceride level of 1760 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0113), without microbiology growth. Workup for malignancy, including computed tomographic scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and screening laboratory test results were negative. With this, a diagnosis of spontaneous chylothorax was made, presumably due to thoracic duct rupture from episodes of coughing. The patient began a low-fat diet and was observed to have improvement with regard to her neck swelling and pleural effusions. She was discharged after 4 days of hospitalization. At follow-up, there was complete resolution of her symptoms. A computed tomographic scan 6 weeks later demonstrated complete resolution of the pleural effusions, normal appearing mediastinum, and no signs of soft tissue inflammation. Given the presentation and clinical course, we suspect the etiology of her bilateral chylothoraces was rupture of the thoracic duct in the left neck, as it enters the jugular or subclavian vein, secondary to coughing.Spontaneous chylothoraces are a rare cause of pleural effusions and pose a diagnostic challenge, as patients present with acute onset of atypical symptoms.1-3 In most cases, the clinical history can lead to the etiology, linking chylothoraces to an undiagnosed malignancy, systemic disease, or trauma. Garcia Restoy et al2 observed that patients usually describe a combination of chest and supraclavicular pain or dyspnea on presentation. In this review of previous reports, all had presented with some degree of supraclavicular or neck swelling.2 This current patient presented with previously described symptoms of this rare pathology. In the absence of an alternative diagnosis, coughing may explain the etiology of bilateral spontaneous chylothoraces.Disruption of the thoracic duct leads to chyle leaks, the severity of these varying based on the cause and location of the injury. A chyloma initially develops, a contained collection below the pleura, and subsequently ruptures into the pleural space. The laterality of these effusions can hint to the location of the injury, most commonly presenting as isolated right- or left-sided effusions, and less frequently bilaterally.4 The etiology of chylothoraces includes nontraumatic causes such as malignancy, congenital duct abnormalities, and systemic diseases (eg, sarcoidosis and amyloidosis). Traumatic causes may be iatrogenic and noniatrogenic, with thoracic surgery as the primary cause of iatrogenic trauma. Among these, esophageal surgery has an incidence as high as 4%.4 Noniatrogenic disruptions constitute 20% of traumatic cases, secondary to penetrating or blunt trauma. Forceful emesis or coughing, as a source of minor trauma, has been linked to the development of chylothoraces.4Diagnosis is made by fluid analysis; triglyceride levels greater than 110 mg/dL are diagnostic, and levels less than 50 mg/dL will be chyle in fewer than 5% of cases.5 An initial priority must be to rule out undiagnosed malignancy.

Workup for malignancy, including computed tomographic scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and screening laboratory test results were negative. With this, a diagnosis of spontaneous chylothorax was made, presumably due to thoracic duct rupture from episodes of coughing. The patient began a low-fat diet and was observed to have improvement with regard to her neck swelling and pleural effusions. She was discharged after 4 days of hospitalization. At follow-up, there was complete resolution of her symptoms. A computed tomographic scan 6 weeks later demonstrated complete resolution of the pleural effusions, normal appearing mediastinum, and no signs of soft tissue inflammation. Given the presentation and clinical course, we suspect the etiology of her bilateral chylothoraces was rupture of the thoracic duct in the left neck, as it enters the jugular or subclavian vein, secondary to coughing.Spontaneous chylothoraces are a rare cause of pleural effusions and pose a diagnostic challenge, as patients present with acute onset of atypical symptoms.1-3 In most cases, the clinical history can lead to the etiology, linking chylothoraces to an undiagnosed malignancy, systemic disease, or trauma. Garcia Restoy et al2 observed that patients usually describe a combination of chest and supraclavicular pain or dyspnea on presentation. In this review of previous reports, all had presented with some degree of supraclavicular or neck swelling.2 This current patient presented with previously described symptoms of this rare pathology. In the absence of an alternative diagnosis, coughing may explain the etiology of bilateral spontaneous chylothoraces.Disruption of the thoracic duct leads to chyle leaks, the severity of these varying based on the cause and location of the injury. A chyloma initially develops, a contained collection below the pleura, and subsequently ruptures into the pleural space. The laterality of these effusions can hint to the location of the injury, most commonly presenting as isolated right- or left-sided effusions, and less frequently bilaterally.4 The etiology of chylothoraces includes nontraumatic causes such as malignancy, congenital duct abnormalities, and systemic diseases (eg, sarcoidosis and amyloidosis). Traumatic causes may be iatrogenic and noniatrogenic, with thoracic surgery as the primary cause of iatrogenic trauma. Among these, esophageal surgery has an incidence as high as 4%.4 Noniatrogenic disruptions constitute 20% of traumatic cases, secondary to penetrating or blunt trauma. Forceful emesis or coughing, as a source of minor trauma, has been linked to the development of chylothoraces.4Diagnosis is made by fluid analysis; triglyceride levels greater than 110 mg/dL are diagnostic, and levels less than 50 mg/dL will be chyle in fewer than 5% of cases.5 An initial priority must be to rule out undiagnosed malignancy.

The patient had a history of IgGκ multiple myeloma, diagnosed approximately 6 months earlier. At that time, flow cytometry showed a κ-restricted plasma cell population positive for CD38 and CD138 but negative for CD3, CD20, and CD45 expression. Cytogenetic analysis with fluorescent in situ hybridization did not reveal high-risk genetic markers. The patient demonstrated no evidence of end organ disease, and her myeloma was classified as stage II. Since her initial diagnosis, she had completed 4 cycles of lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD) therapy in addition to irradiation for lytic lesions of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Physical examination revealed scattered red-violaceous nodules, with the largest measuring approximately 6.0 × 5.5 × 2.5 cm (Figure, A). They were found in the mouth, the trunk, and on all 4 extremities. The lesions were nonulcerated, round with a smooth surface, fixed, and firm and tender to touch. Serum protein levels were normal. An ultrasound-guided needle biopsy and immunohistochemical analysis of the largest lesion on the patient’s right shoulder were performed (Figure, B and C).

Plasmacytoma,C,Plasmacytoma,"Positron emission tomography–computed tomography demonstrated innumerable foci of hypermetabolic activity within the subcutaneous soft tissue but without evidence of direct medullary extension. Biopsy showed diffuse involvement of a monotypic κ-restricted plasma cell dyscrasia with necrosis (Figure, B). The tissue core sample showed extensive necrosis; however, nonnecrotic regions demonstrated a dense monomorphic infiltrate of primarily immature atypical cells with a plasmacytoid appearance. Immunohistochemical stains revealed diffuse CD138 positivity (Figure, C) but negativity for CD3, CD20, CD56, BCL6, and c-kit. These findings were consistent with the patient’s history of κ-restricted multiple myeloma.The development of her cutaneous and mucosal plasmacytomas, despite 4 cycles of RVD, was concerning for refractory disease, and the treatment regimen was switched to dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (DCEP). The patient received the first cycle of DCEP (day 1-4) as an inpatient without complications. No skin breakdown or ulceration was noted during chemotherapy. At her 1-week follow-up visit, the cutaneous plasmacytomas were found to be smaller, less firm in consistency, and reportedly less tender.Multiple myeloma is characterized by a clonal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Clinical manifestations are typically related to organ damage, such as hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone lesions, referred to as “CRAB” symptoms. Extramedullary involvement may occur at any time during the course of the disease and in up to 45% of patients at the time of relapse.1 However, skin involvement was found in fewer than 5% to 10% of patients with myeloma.2 Some suggest a correlation between the proliferation of plasma cells outside the bone marrow and total body tumor cell mass.3 As such, skin findings are often associated with higher tumor burden and more aggressive disease.4 Cutaneous plasmacytomas may occur secondary to multiple myeloma or as primary lesions, without evidence of an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia. All classes of immunoglobulins have been implicated in cases of secondary plasmacytomas, although subtype IgG is the most common.5 In cases of extramedullary disease without evidence of direct tumor extension, hematogenous spread involving loss of cell adhesion molecules such as VLA-4, CD44, and CD56 have been proposed, although this remains incompletely understood.1Morphologically, the usual appearance of cutaneous plasmacytomas are of red-violaceous papules or nodules with or without ulceration. These lesions can range from 1 to 5 cm in diameter with variable distribution, although the trunk and abdominal regions are predominantly involved. Multiple lesions are more common than solitary lesions.6 On palpation, these nodules are smooth with a firm consistency and may be associated with substantial tenderness.Resection of solitary cutaneous plasmacytomas and intralesional injections with either steroids or tumor necrosis factor have shown an overall beneficial response.7 However, extensive and widespread disease, as in the present patient, may require chemotherapy and/or irradiation. While multiple myeloma is considered an incurable disease, studies in the last decade report an increase in 5-year survival rates from 28% to 49%; which has been largely attributed to novel therapies including immunomodulatory agents and proteasome inhibitors.8 Unfortunately, the presence of extramedullary involvement at any time during the disease course has been associated with poor prognosis regardless of therapy.1,4 Currently, various options exist for the treatment of multiple myeloma including immunomodulatory agents, proteasome inhibitors, cytotoxic agents, and stem cell transplantation.9 In relapsed or refractory disease, salvage options have included DCEP, which has shown a beneficial response but is associated with significant treatment-related mortality.10Recognition of the various cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma is important because it may indicate extramedullary involvement or relapsed disease, either of which warrants consideration of a new treatment regimen. The advances in chemotherapy allow more options for those with extramedullary manifestations who may not respond to conventional therapy. Responses to newer approaches such as kinesin-spindle protein inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD38, SLAMF7), and histone deacetylase inhibitors are encouraging, and the addition of these agents may further improve response rates.9",Oncology,"A woman in her 60s presented for evaluation of multiple painful cutaneous nodules that had developed over the previous 2 months.

Responses to newer approaches such as kinesin-spindle protein inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD38, SLAMF7), and histone deacetylase inhibitors are encouraging, and the addition of these agents may further improve response rates.9",Oncology,"A patient in them 60s presented for evaluation of multiple painful cutaneous nodules that had developed over the previous 2 months. The patient had a history of IgGκ multiple myeloma, diagnosed approximately 6 months earlier. At that time, flow cytometry showed a κ-restricted plasma cell population positive for CD38 and CD138 but negative for CD3, CD20, and CD45 expression. Cytogenetic analysis with fluorescent in situ hybridization did not reveal high-risk genetic markers. The patient demonstrated no evidence of end organ disease, and them myeloma was classified as stage II. Since them initial diagnosis, they had completed 4 cycles of lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD) therapy in addition to irradiation for lytic lesions of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Physical examination revealed scattered red-violaceous nodules, with the largest measuring approximately 6.0 × 5.5 × 2.5 cm (Figure, A). They were found in the mouth, the trunk, and on all 4 extremities. The lesions were nonulcerated, round with a smooth surface, fixed, and firm and tender to touch. Serum protein levels were normal. An ultrasound-guided needle biopsy and immunohistochemical analysis of the largest lesion on the patient’s right shoulder were performed (Figure, B and C).",what is your diagnosis?,What is your diagnosis?,Plasmacytoma,Neutrophilic dermatoses,Leukemia cutis,Hemangioma,a,1,1,1,1,neutral,0,0,65.0,61-70,,845,augmented_neutral_fromfemale

Gram, Gomori methenamine silver (GMS), AFB stains, and corresponding tissue cultures returned negative results. Overall, the clinical and histopathological presentation was consistent with Sweet syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis).Sweet syndrome is a reactive process classically diagnosed by the abrupt development of painful erythematous papules, plaques or nodules in the setting of neutrophilia, fever, and malaise.1 There is a visually diverse spectrum of lesions from ulcerated vesicles to subcutaneous nodules, most commonly on the head, neck, and extremities.1,2 Sweet syndrome requires clinical correlation, histopathology, and tissue cultures to exclude other diagnoses, because it can clinically mimic infections and cutaneous metastases.Sweet syndrome can be broken into the subgroups of classical, drug-induced, and malignancy-associated disease. In malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome, the cutaneous eruption may occur as a paraneoplastic herald of disease, and concomitantly with active disease.2 Because neutrophilia may be absent in these cases, it is still important to consider a diagnosis of Sweet syndrome in the setting of neutropenia.2 Malignancy-associated disease is most commonly found with hematologic malignant diseases, with AML being the most closely associated.3 Review of cytological features in patients with AML found increased rates of Sweet syndrome in AML with myelodysplastic-related features, 5q deletion, and FLT3 mutations.3 This patient had both a 5q deletion and p53 mutation, which may have contributed to the development of Sweet syndrome.In contrast to Sweet syndrome, angioinvasive fungal infections typically present as violaceous plaques or papules with central necrosis.4 Genera commonly associated with angioinvasion include Fusarium, Scedosporium, Candida, Aspergillus, and the Mucorales.4,5 Given the dark, dusky erythematous plaques present on this immunocompromised patient, an angioinvasive fungal infection was initially clinically favored. Immunosuppression, neutropenia, and hematological malignant disease, especially AML, as in this patient, are strong risk factors for fungal infection and dissemination, which can quickly become a medical emergency.5-7 Skin biopsies for histologic analysis and tissue culture in immunocompromised patients are essential to make the diagnosis. Histopathologic analysis in this case demonstrated papillary dermal edema with hemorrhage and diffuse neutrophilic infiltrate. Importantly, no organisms were observed and tissue culture results were negative.Bartonella henselae lesions characteristically present at the site of inoculation with an erythematous papule or crusted pustule and tender lymphadenopathy, and can occur secondary to exposure to cats. Histologically, lymph nodes and skin lesions may show central necrosis with surrounding histiocytes and lymphocytes. Although the patient did recall cat scratches, his clinical presentation and histological findings were not consistent with Bartonella infection. Of note, Sweet syndrome lesions have been found to display pathergy with lesion development at sites of cutaneous injury.2 Leukemia cutis also can present with purpuric papules, nodules, and plaques, and also may have numerous neutrophils on histopathologic analysis; however, malignant immature leukocytes would be present in the dermal infiltrate.2After histopathologic confirmation and no growth on tissue cultures, the patient was treated with topical triamcinolone ointment (0.1%) as well as oral prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/d) with clinical resolution of his lesions and gastrointestinal symptoms. This is characteristic of Sweet syndrome, which typically shows an excellent response to systemic corticosteroids. A patient is typically given 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day orally until the lesions improve, before tapering to 10 mg daily over 4 to 6 weeks.2This case is notable for the unusual presentation of Sweet syndrome, clinically mimicking an angioinvasive fungal infection, in the setting of AML. Given the wide differential diagnosis in these patients and the disparity of treatment options, this case highlights the importance of histologic analysis and tissue culture to make an accurate diagnosis in an immunocompromised patient, and the importance of making a timely diagnosis.",Oncology,"A man in his 40s with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) arising from myelodysplasia presented with fever, cough, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, and 1 month of neutropenia.

Overall, the clinical and histopathological presentation was consistent with Sweet syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis).Sweet syndrome is a reactive process classically diagnosed by the abrupt development of painful erythematous papules, plaques or nodules in the setting of neutrophilia, fever, and malaise.1 There is a visually diverse spectrum of lesions from ulcerated vesicles to subcutaneous nodules, most commonly on the head, neck, and extremities.1,2 Sweet syndrome requires clinical correlation, histopathology, and tissue cultures to exclude other diagnoses, because it can clinically mimic infections and cutaneous metastases.Sweet syndrome can be broken into the subgroups of classical, drug-induced, and malignancy-associated disease. In malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome, the cutaneous eruption may occur as a paraneoplastic herald of disease, and concomitantly with active disease.2 Because neutrophilia may be absent in these cases, it is still important to consider a diagnosis of Sweet syndrome in the setting of neutropenia.2 Malignancy-associated disease is most commonly found with hematologic malignant diseases, with AML being the most closely associated.3 Review of cytological features in patients with AML found increased rates of Sweet syndrome in AML with myelodysplastic-related features, 5q deletion, and FLT3 mutations.3 This patient had both a 5q deletion and p53 mutation, which may have contributed to the development of Sweet syndrome.In contrast to Sweet syndrome, angioinvasive fungal infections typically present as violaceous plaques or papules with central necrosis.4 Genera commonly associated with angioinvasion include Fusarium, Scedosporium, Candida, Aspergillus, and the Mucorales.4,5 Given the dark, dusky erythematous plaques present on this immunocompromised patient, an angioinvasive fungal infection was initially clinically favored. Immunosuppression, neutropenia, and hematological malignant disease, especially AML, as in this patient, are strong risk factors for fungal infection and dissemination, which can quickly become a medical emergency.5-7 Skin biopsies for histologic analysis and tissue culture in immunocompromised patients are essential to make the diagnosis. Histopathologic analysis in this case demonstrated papillary dermal edema with hemorrhage and diffuse neutrophilic infiltrate. Importantly, no organisms were observed and tissue culture results were negative.Bartonella henselae lesions characteristically present at the site of inoculation with an erythematous papule or crusted pustule and tender lymphadenopathy, and can occur secondary to exposure to cats. Histologically, lymph nodes and skin lesions may show central necrosis with surrounding histiocytes and lymphocytes. Although the patient did recall cat scratches, his clinical presentation and histological findings were not consistent with Bartonella infection. Of note, Sweet syndrome lesions have been found to display pathergy with lesion development at sites of cutaneous injury.2 Leukemia cutis also can present with purpuric papules, nodules, and plaques, and also may have numerous neutrophils on histopathologic analysis; however, malignant immature leukocytes would be present in the dermal infiltrate.2After histopathologic confirmation and no growth on tissue cultures, the patient was treated with topical triamcinolone ointment (0.1%) as well as oral prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/d) with clinical resolution of his lesions and gastrointestinal symptoms. This is characteristic of Sweet syndrome, which typically shows an excellent response to systemic corticosteroids. A patient is typically given 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day orally until the lesions improve, before tapering to 10 mg daily over 4 to 6 weeks.2This case is notable for the unusual presentation of Sweet syndrome, clinically mimicking an angioinvasive fungal infection, in the setting of AML. Given the wide differential diagnosis in these patients and the disparity of treatment options, this case highlights the importance of histologic analysis and tissue culture to make an accurate diagnosis in an immunocompromised patient, and the importance of making a timely diagnosis.",Oncology,"A woman in her 40s with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) arising from myelodysplasia presented with fever, cough, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, and 1 month of neutropenia.

She was mildly tender in the right iliac fossa and there was a large mobile mass, at least 10 cm in diameter, that was easily palpable in the right iliac fossa. She was initially investigated with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen (Figure 1). She underwent a colonoscopy that showed no intraluminal mucosal abnormalities or masses, but evidence of external compression at the cecum was noted.Coronal (A) and transverse (B) computed tomographic images show a large intra-abdominal cystic mass in the right iliac fossa. What Is Your Diagnosis?",Appendix abscess,Cecal carcinoma,Mucocele of the appendix,Neuroendocrine tumor,C. Mucocele of the appendix,C,Mucocele of the appendix,"The CT scan demonstrated a large right-sided cystic mass arising from the appendix. Based on these findings, the clinical diagnosis of mucocele of the appendix was made and a surgical resection was planned. The normal colonoscopy results excluded cecal carcinoma. Neuroendocrine tumors arising from the appendix usually present with symptoms of acute appendicitis.1 The CT scan appearances are not consistent with that of an appendix abscess.Mucocele of the appendix is an obstructive dilatation of the appendix caused by an intraluminal accumulation of mucoid material, secondary to 1 of the following processes: retention cyst, mucosal hyperplasia, mucinous cystadenoma, or mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.2 Mucoceles are found in 0.2% to 0.3% of all appendectomy specimens.3 Around 50% of patients are asymptomatic at the time of presentation when the mucocele is found as an incidental finding. Other patients may present with abdominal pain, abdominal mass, weight loss, or acute appendicitis.4 The presence of symptoms is associated with a higher incidence of cystadenocarcinoma.The diagnosis is usually confirmed with a CT scan, which characteristically shows a well-encapsulated cystic mass that is usually in the right lower quadrant. Curvilinear mural calcification is seen in 50% of cases.5 Cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas are typically larger and are associated with a 20% incidence of perforation. Perforation is indicated by the presence of ascites in the pelvis and the right upper quadrant.When a mucocele perforates, it releases mucoid material into the peritoneal cavity. This material may be acellular or may contain dysplastic cells. Patients with a spillage of mucus into the peritoneal cavity containing epithelial cells have a different prognosis than those with intact mucoceles, and a specimen of the fluid should be sent for analysis.5 In cases with epithelial cell contamination, patients may progress to developing pseudomyxoma peritonei, peritoneal carcinomatosis, or peritoneal tumors, which is why it is important to keep mucoceles intact during excisions. Peritoneal carcinomatosis may be treated with a combination of cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and patients should be referred to a peritoneal carcinomatosis treatment center for this definitive treatment.6 If a large mucocele is found during laparoscopy, conversion to laparotomy is safer, as it allows the specimen to be removed without rupturing and also allows for an exploration for mucoid fluid.7Excising a mucocele does not have to extend to the right hemicolectomy, unless there is an involvement of the appendiceal or ileocolic lymph nodes, although this is unusual. If a frozen section of the appendix shows a spread of tumor cells longitudinally, this would also require a right hemicolectomy to allow for an adequate removal.8The patient underwent a laparotomy during which a huge cystic lesion occupying much of the right side of the abdomen was found (Figure 2).

Other causes include stenosis or obstruction at the gastrojejunostomy site from ulceration, radiation enteritis, tumor recurrence, bezoars, or foreign bodies.2 In a retrospective study of 186 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer, afferent loop syndrome was found in approximately 13% of long-term survivors (>2 years after surgery).3 The most common clinical signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. Interestingly, this study found that 2-year survival was the only independent predictor for the development of afferent limb syndrome after controlling for other factors such as age, sex, type of surgery, and adjuvant chemoradiation. Malignant obstruction from cancer recurrence was seen in 33% of the patients, while radiation enteropathy was found to be the cause in 38%.Patients with a surgical history of gastric bypass who present with pancreaticobiliary problems, such as obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, or pancreatitis, should be evaluated for afferent loop syndrome. Computed tomographic imaging is the diagnostic study of choice. Acute or complete obstruction of the afferent limb is a surgical emergency. If the obstruction is benign, surgery would include adhesiolysis and reconstruction; however, if the obstruction is malignant, then bypass or excision and reconstruction should be performed. Several studies favor endoscopic stenting or transhepatic percutaneous stenting; however, results are limited because these minimally invasive procedures are very technically difficult to do given the altered anatomy.4-6After fluid resuscitation and placement of a nasogastric tube, this patient underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy with manual evaluation of the intussusception. There was no evidence of bowel ischemia nor obvious tumor at the lead point.

The patient presented a deep wound induced by the bistoury piercing of the index finger pulp of the right hand, with a disrupted epidermal barrier. Both the patient who was operated on and the surgeon were negative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B/C virus testing. A soft tissue abscess of the digit appeared 7 days after the initial trauma. Antibiotic therapy combining amoxicillin and clavulanate was started, without any significant improvement. Surgery was performed urgently, with excision of the wound entrance and washing of the flexor tendon sheath. Bacteriological swabs were performed in the same time. An antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate was prescribed. Forty-eight hours after surgery, pustules appeared. Further drainage and washing of the sheath were repeated (Figure, A). The bacteriological samples were found to be sterile. The surgeon was hospitalized for infusions combining piperacillin/tazobactam and teicoplanine, carried out over 72 hours. An oral antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate (3 g every 24 hours) was prescribed for 10 additional days. The lesions completely resolved within 2 weeks.

Radiography did not reveal any sign suggestive of osteitis, while focused ultrasonography did not individualize any foreign body or damage to the flexor sheath. The vesicle fluid was positive for herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1) by in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction, leading to the diagnosis of a recurrent HSV-1 herpetic whitlow.Owing to a lack of knowledge of this viral infection, herpetic whitlow is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as a bacterial infection. The estimated incidence of herpetic whitlow is about 2.5 per 100 000 patients per year, which is probably mistaken.1 It mainly affects children younger than 10 years (HSV-1) or young adults (HSV-1 or HSV-2).2-4 Health care workers are at higher risk of contamination, especially when they are in contact with the oral cavity or secretions from the nasopharynx and mouth, ie, dentists, anesthesiologists, and medical staff working in intensive care units.5The literature reports several cases of complications resulting from misdiagnosed herpetic whitlows treated with surgery, ie, incision and drainage that may lead to secondary bacterial infection.2,6,7 Systemic and/or local complications, such as herpetic keratitis, hypoesthesia or hyperesthesia, and nail loss, are described. Misdiagnosis leading to unnecessary surgery and potential increasing morbidity highlights the importance of diagnosing a herpetic whitlow without wasting time in medical workers. Some characteristic clinical signs may be helpful: (1) occurrence after trauma in the skin defect area, usually in the dominant hand; (2) prodromal pain that appears between 2 and 20 days after inoculation; (3) occasional presence of fever and systemic symptoms; and (4) typical appearance  of a large vesicle with serous fluid surrounded by erythema; grouped or scattered vesicles can be also observed. The diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction or viral cultures.After resolution of the initial infection, the virus can be reactivated spontaneously or triggered by an appropriate stimulus, eg, a general illness, stress, ultraviolet light exposure, menstruation, or tissue damage. About 20% to 50% of patients experience a recurrence that remains usually milder than the primary infection.1 Herpetic whitlow requires an appropriate treatment with oral antiviral medication. Acyclovir or valacyclovir may be beneficial in this context to prevent recurrence and reduce duration of symptoms.8 The other aim of treatment is to prevent autoinoculation and transmission of the infection, with local protection with wound dressing.9This case emphasized that herpetic whitlow may occur in any health care worker who has regular contact with contaminated oral secretion.

Based on the patient’s critical conditions and severe long-standing obstruction with initial signs of ischemia and shock, taking the patient immediately to the operating room was most logical, a choice especially justified in settings without a daily 24-hour interventional endoscopy service. However, the surgical risks of an aggressive treatment such as laparotomy in a frail patient should be carefully considered, along with the potential health care burden of surgery, a prolonged intensive care unit stay, and/or a long recovery of a patient with an irreversible condition/advanced dementia. In the case of sigmoid volvulus, the 2016 American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons Guidelines recommend performing an endoscopic derotation, which is less invasive and cheaper than a surgical intervention. It is effective in 60% to 95% of cases, but it has a risk of overall recurrence up to 61%,1 could lead to complications such as perforation, and should not be performed in patients with suspected ischemia or perforation. However, for an endoscopic failure or finding of gangrene, the only possible therapeutic step is performing an emergency laparotomy and sigmoidectomy, which has significant morbidity and mortality rates, especially among high-risk patients (based on their American Society of Anesthesiologists score).A computed tomography scan and a diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium enema were performed with a diagnostic and therapeutic purpose, confirming a huge colonic volvulus with a twisted mesentery and a vascular compromise (so-called “whirl-sign” highlighted within the red circle).We successfully performed an emergency colonoscopy for derotation and decompression. However, the mucosa appeared endoscopically dusky. While without such comorbidities and surrogate decisions to limit interventions immediate laparotomy would be appropriate given the ischemic signs and symptoms, because of the patient’s critical conditions and underlying chronic diseases with advanced Alzheimer dementia, and after discussion with his family and guardian, we decided not to proceed with futile therapeutic procedures and give him palliative care with appropriate painless end-of-life comfort.2 The physician in charge should discuss the situation with relatives/guardians, make them aware of a probable therapeutic futility, and listen to their point of view while explaining the reasons and consequences of such action.3,4 Provided the critical conditions of the patient and his severe comorbidities, the final decision making may be influenced by the judgment of not only the surgeon, anesthetist, and physician in charge, but also by the cultural environment and the feelings of the patient’s relatives.

Sigmoid volvulus,C,Sigmoid volvulus,"A plain abdominal radiograph showed a clear coffee bean-like or “bent inner tube” sign, suggestive for colonic volvulus. A computed tomography scan confirmed a huge colonic volvulus with a twisted mesentery and vascular compromise (Figure 2). Based on the patient’s critical conditions and severe long-standing obstruction with initial signs of ischemia and shock, taking the patient immediately to the operating room was most logical, a choice especially justified in settings without a daily 24-hour interventional endoscopy service. However, the surgical risks of an aggressive treatment such as laparotomy in a frail patient should be carefully considered, along with the potential health care burden of surgery, a prolonged intensive care unit stay, and/or a long recovery of a patient with an irreversible condition/advanced dementia. In the case of sigmoid volvulus, the 2016 American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons Guidelines recommend performing an endoscopic derotation, which is less invasive and cheaper than a surgical intervention. It is effective in 60% to 95% of cases, but it has a risk of overall recurrence up to 61%,1 could lead to complications such as perforation, and should not be performed in patients with suspected ischemia or perforation. However, for an endoscopic failure or finding of gangrene, the only possible therapeutic step is performing an emergency laparotomy and sigmoidectomy, which has significant morbidity and mortality rates, especially among high-risk patients (based on their American Society of Anesthesiologists score).A computed tomography scan and a diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium enema were performed with a diagnostic and therapeutic purpose, confirming a huge colonic volvulus with a twisted mesentery and a vascular compromise (so-called “whirl-sign” highlighted within the red circle).We successfully performed an emergency colonoscopy for derotation and decompression. However, the mucosa appeared endoscopically dusky. While without such comorbidities and surrogate decisions to limit interventions immediate laparotomy would be appropriate given the ischemic signs and symptoms, because of the patient’s critical conditions and underlying chronic diseases with advanced Alzheimer dementia, and after discussion with his family and guardian, we decided not to proceed with futile therapeutic procedures and give him palliative care with appropriate painless end-of-life comfort.2 The physician in charge should discuss the situation with relatives/guardians, make them aware of a probable therapeutic futility, and listen to their point of view while explaining the reasons and consequences of such action.3,4 Provided the critical conditions of the patient and his severe comorbidities, the final decision making may be influenced by the judgment of not only the surgeon, anesthetist, and physician in charge, but also by the cultural environment and the feelings of the patient’s relatives.

Osteosarcoma metastasis,C,Osteosarcoma metastasis,"Pathologic analysis revealed metastatic osteosarcoma in a 6.5-cm mass. The mass showed apparent bony tissue.Metastases to the thyroid gland are reported at autopsy in 1% to 24% of metastatic cancer patients.1,2 The most common sites were kidney, lung, breast, esophagus, and uterus.3-5 Some studies showed that the most common primary tumor for thyroid metastases was lung cancer4,6,7; however, some showed renal cell carcinoma.3,8 Review articles concluded that lung and renal cell carcinomas made up more than 80% of total thyroid gland metastases. Unlike uterine cancer, cancer of the cervix is not a common primary source for thyroid metastasis. Unlike the considerable predominance of primary thyroid cancers in women, some studies have found male,1 some have found female,3 and some studies have found no gender predominance4,5 for metastasis to the thyroid gland.The majority of patients presented with clinical complaints, such as new-onset neck swelling, dysphagia, dysphonia, and cough.8 Clinical differential diagnosis for a rapidly enlarging unilateral thyroid mass includes anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), thyroid lymphoma or sarcoma, metastasis to the thyroid gland, and abscess. Differential diagnosis for pathology should include osteosarcoma, sarcomatoid PDTC, ATC with osseous metaplasia, medullary thyroid carcinoma, spindle epithelial tumor with thymus-like differentiation, and synovial sarcoma.9 The cytological image may be ambiguous and requires histopathological confirmation, supported by immunohistochemical examinations.Sarcomas are derived from mesenchymal cells, such as bone, fat, and muscle. Sarcomas of the thyroid, both primary and metastatic, are rare. Osteosarcomas express vimentin; leiomyosarcomas express vimentin, desmin, and smooth-muscle actin. Unlike PDTC, ATC often displays p53 mutations and does not stain for thyroglobulin and often not vimentin. Osteosarcoma may be positive for p53.Metastases of primary tumors can be divided into 2 categories: synchronous and metachronous. Synchronous indicates that the tumors are detected at the same time as the thyroid metastases, whereas metachronous indicates that the thyroid metastases are detected some time after the primary tumor was detected. The mean interval between discovery of the primary tumor and the thyroid metastases was 5.8 years.8 Our patient presented with thyroid gland metastasis after 4 years of disease-free survival without other metastasis apparent on PET-CT examination.We recommend neck ultrasonography for all thyroid enlargement as a first step for imaging. However, in selected cases, CT or PET-CT may be considered initially if clinical suspicion is high for nonthyroid causes such as metastases.In patients with clinically suspected metastasis to the thyroid gland, core-needle biopsy achieved a significantly higher sensitivity than fine-needle biopsy without any false-negative results.10 In cases of known rare primary malignant abnormality, nontypical ultrasonography features of primary thyroid malignant abnormality, and need for an additional immunohistochemical analysis, core-needle biopsy may be primarily considered.10 In this case, we deferred biopsy considering highly calcified tissue on CT imaging and likelihood of osteosarcoma metastasis with previous history of osteosarcoma.The treatment is surgical excision of the lesion with or without lymph node dissection. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy is also considered in selected cases of local recurrence or concomitant metastases. Surgical treatment was associated with improved survival duration.3 The incidence of surgical complications was very low and did not vary by extent of surgical treatment. The most common surgical complications are injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and incomplete resection of the metastasis. In 1 review,5 no patients had tumor recurrence when margins were negative. In light of these data, subtotal thyroidectomy may be warranted unless there is concern for involvement of the contralateral lobe. However, another review3 found that recurrence was more likely in patients treated with subtotal thyroidectomies (13.3%) vs total thyroidectomies (4.8%).Metastasis of osteosarcoma to the thyroid gland is rare. It is important to consider thyroid metastases in the differential diagnosis in thyroid nodules, especially in patients with a medical history of malignant abnormality and rapidly enlarging thyroid mass.

Osteosarcoma metastasis,C,Osteosarcoma metastasis,"Pathologic analysis revealed metastatic osteosarcoma in a 6.5-cm mass. The mass showed apparent bony tissue.Metastases to the thyroid gland are reported at autopsy in 1% to 24% of metastatic cancer patients.1,2 The most common sites were kidney, lung, breast, esophagus, and uterus.3-5 Some studies showed that the most common primary tumor for thyroid metastases was lung cancer4,6,7; however, some showed renal cell carcinoma.3,8 Review articles concluded that lung and renal cell carcinomas made up more than 80% of total thyroid gland metastases. Unlike uterine cancer, cancer of the cervix is not a common primary source for thyroid metastasis. Unlike the considerable predominance of primary thyroid cancers in women, some studies have found male,1 some have found female,3 and some studies have found no gender predominance4,5 for metastasis to the thyroid gland.The majority of patients presented with clinical complaints, such as new-onset neck swelling, dysphagia, dysphonia, and cough.8 Clinical differential diagnosis for a rapidly enlarging unilateral thyroid mass includes anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), thyroid lymphoma or sarcoma, metastasis to the thyroid gland, and abscess. Differential diagnosis for pathology should include osteosarcoma, sarcomatoid PDTC, ATC with osseous metaplasia, medullary thyroid carcinoma, spindle epithelial tumor with thymus-like differentiation, and synovial sarcoma.9 The cytological image may be ambiguous and requires histopathological confirmation, supported by immunohistochemical examinations.Sarcomas are derived from mesenchymal cells, such as bone, fat, and muscle. Sarcomas of the thyroid, both primary and metastatic, are rare. Osteosarcomas express vimentin; leiomyosarcomas express vimentin, desmin, and smooth-muscle actin. Unlike PDTC, ATC often displays p53 mutations and does not stain for thyroglobulin and often not vimentin. Osteosarcoma may be positive for p53.Metastases of primary tumors can be divided into 2 categories: synchronous and metachronous. Synchronous indicates that the tumors are detected at the same time as the thyroid metastases, whereas metachronous indicates that the thyroid metastases are detected some time after the primary tumor was detected. The mean interval between discovery of the primary tumor and the thyroid metastases was 5.8 years.8 Our patient presented with thyroid gland metastasis after 4 years of disease-free survival without other metastasis apparent on PET-CT examination.We recommend neck ultrasonography for all thyroid enlargement as a first step for imaging. However, in selected cases, CT or PET-CT may be considered initially if clinical suspicion is high for nonthyroid causes such as metastases.In patients with clinically suspected metastasis to the thyroid gland, core-needle biopsy achieved a significantly higher sensitivity than fine-needle biopsy without any false-negative results.10 In cases of known rare primary malignant abnormality, nontypical ultrasonography features of primary thyroid malignant abnormality, and need for an additional immunohistochemical analysis, core-needle biopsy may be primarily considered.10 In this case, we deferred biopsy considering highly calcified tissue on CT imaging and likelihood of osteosarcoma metastasis with previous history of osteosarcoma.The treatment is surgical excision of the lesion with or without lymph node dissection. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy is also considered in selected cases of local recurrence or concomitant metastases. Surgical treatment was associated with improved survival duration.3 The incidence of surgical complications was very low and did not vary by extent of surgical treatment. The most common surgical complications are injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and incomplete resection of the metastasis. In 1 review,5 no patients had tumor recurrence when margins were negative. In light of these data, subtotal thyroidectomy may be warranted unless there is concern for involvement of the contralateral lobe. However, another review3 found that recurrence was more likely in patients treated with subtotal thyroidectomies (13.3%) vs total thyroidectomies (4.8%).Metastasis of osteosarcoma to the thyroid gland is rare.

In the week following her first treatment, the patient reported a few mild morning headaches that improved with acetaminophen. After receiving 3 cycles of ipilimumab, 3 mg/kg, and nivolumab, 1 mg/kg, and 8 weeks after her first treatment, the patient reported experiencing daily headaches for at least the prior week and a half. The location of her headaches varied, and there was no associated eye or temple pain. At best, with taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the headache decreased to pain rated 3 on a scale of 1 to 10. Also at this time, the patient reported low energy levels and difficulty reading; however, physical examination showed no gross visual field defects. Laboratory workup conducted 8 weeks after initiating treatment included adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels that were measured at 25 pg/mL (reference range, 10-60 pg/mL) and 16.8 μg/dL (reference range, 6-24 μg/dL), respectively. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 0.82 mIU/L (reference range, 0.5-5.0 mIU/L), which was gradually decreasing compared with 1.41 mIU/L 5 weeks earlier and 1.21 mIU/L 2 weeks earlier. Her total triiodothyronine level was measured at 73 ng/dL (reference range, 80-200 ng/dL) and free thyroxine level was 1.0 ng/dL (reference range, 0.9-1.7 ng/dL).

Immune-related hypophysitis,B,Immune-related hypophysitis,"Magnetic resonance images at 8 weeks after initiating ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy demonstrate an enlarged ovoid-shaped pituitary gland and thickening of the infundibulum. Based both on the constellation of imaging, laboratory, and clinical findings and the known association of hypophysitis during immune-checkpoint inhibitor treatment, the diagnosis of immune-related hypophysitis was made in this patient treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab. The laboratory abnormalities associated with hypophysitis can include low or inappropriately normal levels of TSH, low levels of ACTH, thyroid hormones, or gonadal hormones. Disruptions of the pituitary can lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, or hypogonadism. Hypophysitis is one of the many adverse effects that has been related to immunotherapies; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, aseptic meningitis, and other neurologic adverse effects have also been reported.1The patient was started on steroid therapy with 20/10-mg doses (am/pm replacement dose) of hydrocortisone. The treatment of hypophysitis was complicated when at 3 days following her last cycle of ipilimumab and nivolumab she was admitted to the hospital for colitis. She was hospitalized for 3 weeks and treated with Solu-Medrol and infliximab. She was discharged receiving a high-dose of prednisone and later tapered to a maintenance dose of hydrocortisone. In total, she completed 4 cycles of ipilimumab and nivolumab.The patient’s clinical symptoms resolved, including headache and fatigue. A follow-up MRI demonstrated resolution of the pituitary enlargement (Figure). She continues to be monitored for adrenal insufficiency and thyroid abnormalities, and more than a year after initiation of treatment her adrenocorticotropic hormone level was 5 pg/mL (reference range, 10-60 pg/mL) and morning cortisol level was 12.9 μg/dL (reference range, 6-14 μg/dL).Mechanistically, ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against programed cell death protein-1 (PD-1). CTLA-4 and PD-1 normally function as immune checkpoints by downregulating pathways involved in T lymphocyte activation. By binding CTLA-4 and PD-1, ipilimumab and nivolumab increase the activation of the immune system by inactivating these immune checkpoints. Immune-checkpoint inhibition has been associated with a unique set of adverse events termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that can involve multiple organ systems in the body.2,3 Immune-related hypophysitis during immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy is an uncommon but increasingly recognized form of irAE. Various studies examining patients treated with monotherapy ipilimumab have reported an incidence of immune-related hypophysitis ranging from 1% to 13%.4-8 The median time of onset for hypophysitis after beginning ipilimumab was found to be 9 weeks (range, 5-36 weeks).7 In a study analyzing nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy, 11.7% of patients developed hypophysitis.9The treatment of ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis is often with systemic high-dose corticosteroids, although the supportive-treatment with hormone replacement for hypophysitis-related hormone deficiencies could also be considered as a treatment strategy. It was noted that frequency of hypophysitis resolution and time to resolution did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment strategies, nor did either group recover from persistent adrenal insufficiency.7This case highlights the clinical and radiographic presentation of immune-related hypophysitis during ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy for metastatic melanoma.

The treatment of hypophysitis was complicated when at 3 days following her last cycle of ipilimumab and nivolumab she was admitted to the hospital for colitis. She was hospitalized for 3 weeks and treated with Solu-Medrol and infliximab. She was discharged receiving a high-dose of prednisone and later tapered to a maintenance dose of hydrocortisone. In total, she completed 4 cycles of ipilimumab and nivolumab.The patient’s clinical symptoms resolved, including headache and fatigue. A follow-up MRI demonstrated resolution of the pituitary enlargement (Figure). She continues to be monitored for adrenal insufficiency and thyroid abnormalities, and more than a year after initiation of treatment her adrenocorticotropic hormone level was 5 pg/mL (reference range, 10-60 pg/mL) and morning cortisol level was 12.9 μg/dL (reference range, 6-14 μg/dL).Mechanistically, ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against programed cell death protein-1 (PD-1). CTLA-4 and PD-1 normally function as immune checkpoints by downregulating pathways involved in T lymphocyte activation. By binding CTLA-4 and PD-1, ipilimumab and nivolumab increase the activation of the immune system by inactivating these immune checkpoints. Immune-checkpoint inhibition has been associated with a unique set of adverse events termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that can involve multiple organ systems in the body.2,3 Immune-related hypophysitis during immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy is an uncommon but increasingly recognized form of irAE. Various studies examining patients treated with monotherapy ipilimumab have reported an incidence of immune-related hypophysitis ranging from 1% to 13%.4-8 The median time of onset for hypophysitis after beginning ipilimumab was found to be 9 weeks (range, 5-36 weeks).7 In a study analyzing nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy, 11.7% of patients developed hypophysitis.9The treatment of ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis is often with systemic high-dose corticosteroids, although the supportive-treatment with hormone replacement for hypophysitis-related hormone deficiencies could also be considered as a treatment strategy. It was noted that frequency of hypophysitis resolution and time to resolution did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment strategies, nor did either group recover from persistent adrenal insufficiency.7This case highlights the clinical and radiographic presentation of immune-related hypophysitis during ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy for metastatic melanoma. As the use of immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapies rapidly increases in clinical oncology practice, heightened awareness of and familiarity with the manifestations of various forms of irAEs, including hypophysitis, will be important for clinicians involved in immuno-oncology patient care.",Oncology,"A 56-year-old patient with metastatic melanoma receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab every 3 weeks developed headaches during the course of them treatment. In the week following them first treatment, the patient reported a few mild morning headaches that improved with acetaminophen. After receiving 3 cycles of ipilimumab, 3 mg/kg, and nivolumab, 1 mg/kg, and 8 weeks after them first treatment, the patient reported experiencing daily headaches for at least the prior week and a half. The location of them headaches varied, and there was no associated eye or temple pain. At best, with taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the headache decreased to pain rated 3 on a scale of 1 to 10. Also at this time, the patient reported low energy levels and difficulty reading; however, physical examination showed no gross visual field defects. Laboratory workup conducted 8 weeks after initiating treatment included adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels that were measured at 25 pg/mL (reference range, 10-60 pg/mL) and 16.8 μg/dL (reference range, 6-24 μg/dL), respectively. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 0.82 mIU/L (reference range, 0.5-5.0 mIU/L), which was gradually decreasing compared with 1.41 mIU/L 5 weeks earlier and 1.21 mIU/L 2 weeks earlier. Them total triiodothyronine level was measured at 73 ng/dL (reference range, 80-200 ng/dL) and free thyroxine level was 1.0 ng/dL (reference range, 0.9-1.7 ng/dL). Them serum sodium level was measured at 138 mEq/L; 1 week later it was measured at 135 mEq/L (reference range, 135-145 mEq/L). Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed for further assessment (Figure).Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain obtained 8 weeks after initiating ipilimumab (A-C) and nivolumab treatment and at follow-up (D).",what is your diagnosis?,What is your diagnosis?,Brain metastasis,Immune-related hypophysitis,Pituitary adenoma,Mucocele,b,1,1,0,1,neutral,0,0,56.0,51-60,,939,augmented_neutral_fromfemale

He served in the military for 4 years, including a 6-month tour in Iraq. While in Iraq he worked as an assault vehicle operator and was involved in frequent foot patrols. He reported numerous traumatic experiences, including frequent receipt of incoming fire, multiple ambushes, and an explosion by an improvised explosive device (IED) that injured several fellow soldiers (see Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review).1He denied any psychiatric issues prior to his military service, but reported that since returning home “there ain’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about [these experiences].” The thoughts were highly distressing and he had frequent violent nightmares. He reported intense guilt relating to the belief that he should have detected the IED and been able to protect his colleagues. He reported a number of triggers (eg, walking down a city street; driving by a shooting range) that reminded him of his experiences in Iraq and induced panic-like symptoms (eg, fear, anxiety, racing heart, and feeling shaky). He avoided things that reminded him of these events and was reluctant to discuss his history (see Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review).1He felt numb and withdrawn from others, reported difficulty sleeping, and was always “on guard.” He startled easily and had angry outbursts. The patient was hopeless at times, but denied suicidal thoughts. He reported difficulty concentrating and had significant fluctuations in his weight. He denied mania, psychosis, or medical problems. He reported drinking more than 12 beers 2 to 3 times per week. He denied any other substance abuse history.The patient was briefly in outpatient treatment while he was still in the military.

CPT focuses on reframing cognitive distortions about the trauma and providing skills for emotion regulation while PE provides patients with a graded exposure to trauma reminders and triggers in an attempt to undo a conditioned fear response (see Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review)1 (Audio).The Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense (VA/DoD) clinical practice guidelines recommend trauma-focused psychotherapies, including CPT and PE, as first-line treatment options for PTSD.3 While trauma-focused therapies are almost universally recommended across treatment guidelines,3,4 recommendations regarding other types of psychotherapy have been mixed. Non–trauma-focused psychotherapies (such as supportive psychotherapy, nondirective counseling, and psychodynamic therapy) are not as effective in treating PTSD symptoms5 but may help by restoring interpersonal relationships and occupational functioning.6Direct head-to-head comparisons of CPT and PE with pharmacotherapy for treatment of PTSD are limited. Two SSRIs, sertraline and paroxetine, are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PTSD. The VA/DoD guidelines recommend SSRIs as first-line agents3 while the World Health Organization recommends SSRIs only as a second-line treatment after psychotherapy or in the case of comorbid depression. An analysis of VA prescription drug records showed that pharmacologic approaches to treating PTSD are the first-line treatment in the majority of veterans, with SSRIs being the primary agents.7 As with many anxiety-related disorders, the early adverse effects of increased anxiety can be marked with SSRIs in treating PTSD, so “starting low and going slow” with titration is important.Second-generation antipsychotics are not recommended for the treatment of PTSD except in populations with comorbid psychosis. Historically, these medications have been used as an augmentation strategy for individuals with SSRI-resistant illness. However, in a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, risperidone did not lead to improvements in PTSD, anxiety, or depression though patients treated with risperidone did show elevated rates of adverse effects.8Prazosin and propranolol have been studied as a potential treatment based on the hyperadrenergic model of PTSD (see Theme 2, Dysregulated Circuits, in related Educational Review).1 However, prazosin and propranolol have not been effective as primary treatment for PTSD. Prazosin is effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of nightmares in patients with PTSD and is recommended for this limited purpose.9 Propranolol has been explored for preventing the original consolidation of fear learning and/or its potential to block the reconsolidation of fear memories (see Theme 3, Memory Reconsolidation, in related Educational Review).1,10 While both of these ideas are active areas of investigation, neither is currently recommended.PTSD is a heterogeneous and complex disorder. Evidence supports trauma-focused therapy as first-line treatment, but a significant portion of patients do not respond adequately and nonadherence is common.2 Given these limitations, it is critical to expand our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms that contribute to the development of PTSD in order to identify and develop more effective treatments.The patient's mental health fluctuated considerably over the next several years: he engaged in medication management but consistently declined to engage in trauma-focused psychotherapy. He did well when he was able to engage in recovery-oriented work activities that distanced him from the memory of his traumatic events.

2757,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2599165,"A previously healthy man in his 50s was referred with right upper abdominal pain he had experienced for 20 days, with high-grade fever and chills since the first week. There was no history of trauma or alcohol intake. Clinical examination revealed no icterus or significant lymphadenopathy. There was guarding and tenderness in the right upper quadrant; the liver was firm, smooth, and palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory investigations were remarkable for white blood cell counts of 13 200/μL (to convert to × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and alkaline phosphatase of 259 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167). Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a large hypoechoic area in the right lobe of the liver along with gallstones. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan was performed (Figure 1).Sections of the contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan show a large hypodense area (blue arrowhead) measuring 16 × 11.8 × 12.4 cm, involving segments 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, along with a gallstone (black arrowhead). The gallbladder fundus (red arrowhead) is seen just caudal to this hypodense area.Acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder What Is Your Diagnosis?",Liver abscess,Acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder,Gallbladder cancer with contiguous liver infiltration,Necrotic liver tumor,B. Acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder,B,Acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder,"The correct diagnosis is intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder. The short history, fever, and leucocytosis suggest an inflammatory pathology. While liver abscess is a valid differential diagnosis, the preceding history of pain suggests acute cholecystitis leading to perforation of the gallbladder, at which time the patient manifested fever. On CECT, there is clear loss of continuity of the gallbladder fundus with stones floating freely in the liver, confirming the diagnosis beyond doubt. The lack of any mucosal irregularity or mass in the gallbladder rules out a tumor. Although large necrotic liver tumors can present with fever, the imaging in this patient is diagnostic. There is no particular enhancement pattern or solid component to suggest a tumor. Additionally, the perileisonal edema suggests abscess formation.Acute cholecystitis is frequently encountered in surgical practice, but intrahepatic gallbladder perforation with abscess formation is a rare and life-threatening complication, with only a few case reports published to date, to our knowledge.1 Although Niemeier2 originally described pericholecystic abscess following a localized perforation as type II, most reports qualify an intraheptic perforation under the same category with some modification.3 Definitive diagnosis can be made on ultrasonography and CECT. For the diagnosis of perforation, CECT is more sensitive than ultrasound.4 Management depends on the general condition of the patient and the size of the intrahepatic collection.

For the past year, the patient had been investigated for hypochromic microcytic anemia. As part of the investigation, he underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and a colonoscopy, which revealed a normal-looking bowel with no obvious source of bleeding visualized. Further investigation involved capsule endoscopy, which was ingested 3 days prior to his emergency department admission. The patient claimed not to have passed a bowel movement containing the capsule. Physical examination results were normal except for a nontender distended and tympanic abdomen. Results of routine laboratory testing were essentially normal except for a low level of hemoglobin (8.1 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]), with no leukocytosis noted. Contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography demonstrated a small-bowel obstruction, with a transition zone located at the mid-jejunum. An intraluminal hypodense mass was demonstrated in this area and appeared to be the cause of the obstruction. Adjacent to this area, the capsule was clearly demonstrated in a dilated proximal loop of the small bowel (Figure 1).Computed tomographic scan showing an intraluminal hypodense mass (pink arrowhead) causing a small-bowel obstruction.

Small-bowel adenocarcinoma,A,Small-bowel adenocarcinoma,"Primary small-bowel adenocarcinoma is a rare and diagnostically challenging malignancy. Although the small bowel accounts for up to 90% of the mucosal surface area of the digestive tract, it accounts for less than 5% of gastrointestinal tumors.1 The most common histological subtype is small-bowel adenocarcinoma, followed by carcinoid tumors, small-bowel lymphoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the small bowel.2 The diagnosis of small-bowel tumors is often delayed because of vague and nonspecific symptoms, mainly abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, and bleeding.3 In this instance, the patient presented with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and underwent capsule endoscopy, a highly sensitive outpatient procedure that allows for complete small-bowel visualization.4,5 Capsule endoscopy is a safe and minimally invasive diagnostic tool but should not be performed in the context of subocclusion because of the dangers of capsule retention. In a single-center study with 1000 capsule endoscopy procedures, capsule retention occurred in 1.4% of patients6; however, none of the 14 patients presented with acute small-bowel obstruction. In this patient, the combination of a partially occluding tumor along with the presence of the capsule agglomerated to an acute small-bowel obstruction requiring immediate laparoscopic small-bowel resection. The pathology report revealed the tumor to be small-bowel adenocarcinoma (Figure 2).Surgical specimen showing an endoluminal circumferential obstructing polypoid tumor of the small intestine.To this day, there is no definite method to avoid capsule retention. Use of a patency test capsule is recommended in patients with suspected small-bowel stricture or mass.7 Conversely, some investigators have pointed out that capsule retention may facilitate identification and treatment of underlying pathology.8",Surgery,"A 43-year-old man with generally good health presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of cramps and abdominal pain.

The expansion of this patient’s tumor from unnoticeable to 8-cm diameter in less than 3 weeks is remarkable, as is the dramatic reversal in response to dexamethasone.Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma arises from either physiologic lymphoid tissue (ie, Peyer patches in the gut) or from acquired MALT that develops in response to infection or autoimmune disease (ie, Hashimoto thyroiditis or Sjogren syndrome).1 Although the central nervous system (CNS) lacks mucosa, MALT lymphoma is thought to arise from meningothelial cells.5 Under these inflammatory conditions a pathologic clone may overtake the normal population, giving rise to malignant lymphocytes that express general B-cell markers (CD19, CD20, CD79a), some complement receptors (CD21, CD35), but are negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD23, and cyclin D1 expression.2In general, MALT lymphomas carry a positive prognosis, with an estimated 5-year survival of 90% for extragastric MALT lymphomas.1 However, CNS involvement occurs so rarely that survival in this subtype has not been determined.2 Short-term follow-up of reported cases involving the dura demonstrates potential for complete remission following surgery and adjuvant therapy, suggesting a similarly positive outlook.2 The ideal treatment regimen for MALT lymphoma has not been determined, and typically involves a patient-specific combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. In general MALT lymphomas tend to be radiosensitive, responding well to low-dose radiation therapy.6 For this reason, there is a general preference for radiotherapy over chemotherapy in the treatment of localized MALT lymphoma. Data from a case series of patients with dural MALT lymphoma treated with radiation therapy suggests that MALT lymphoma of the dura is no different in this regard and the authors recommend low-dose and limited-field radiation therapy for focal, localized dural MALT lymphoma.10This case illustrates the importance of including low-grade MALT lymphoma in the differential for a rapidly enlarging scalp mass.

The patient was taken to the operating room for exploration. In the operating room, a lobster claw shell (Figure 2, white arrowhead) was found, perforating the distal ileum through the mesenteric surface and with impending perforation on the antimesenteric surface (Figure 2, black arrowhead). The patient underwent small-bowel resection with primary anastomosis to remove the involved segment of bowel with the claw fragment. The patient did recall eating lobster rolls at a national fast food chain prior to onset of abdominal pain but he did not recall biting or swallowing a shell fragment. He was discharged from the hospital within 5 days, after an uneventful recovery.Terminal ileum with lobster claw shell (white arrowhead) perforating the distal ileum through the mesenteric surface and with impending perforation on the antimesenteric surface (black arrowhead).The involuntary ingestion of foreign bodies is well described with thousands of case reports and series available in the literature. The topic continues to be of great interest to patients and physicians precisely because it is so common and yet appears bizarre. While items such as spoons, pins, blades, dentures, toothpicks, and grill brush bristles are often implicated in foreign body ingestion,1-4 problematic food ingestions are also of significant clinical concern.2,3,5 Fish bones are particularly problematic in unintentional ingestions and are reported as causative factors in complications from ingestions in up to 63% of cases.2 While the ingestion of crustacean claws is less frequent (any ingestion of a crustacean fragment is reported in less than 20% of unintentional ingestions),2,3 the presentation can be quite dramatic, perhaps because of the cutting function of the claw.6,7 Regardless of the type of foreign body ingestion, the ileocecal region tends to be the most common site of perforation (30%-39%),1-3 presumably because it represents an anatomic site of narrowing where foreign bodies can become lodged and erode through the bowel wall. We suspect adhesions from this patient’s appendectomy contributed to perforation in this area for him.A significant risk factor for foreign body ingestion in adult patients without mental illness is the use of dentures as they cover the palate and can interfere with normal food sensation. In reported series, approximately 70% of patients who presented with foreign body ingestion wore dentures.2,3 Eating quickly and chewing coarsely also contribute to the risk of foreign body ingestion.8 Of note, foreign body ingestion is often not noticed by patients and a high index of suspicion must be maintained when a previously well patient presents with abdominal complaints after eating.9 Missed preoperative diagnosis or misdiagnosis as an inflammatory process such as appendicitis or diverticulitis is common.2",Surgery,"A 52-year-old previously healthy patient presented to the emergency department with gradual onset of severe right lower quadrant abdominal pain over the course of 24 hours.

In a case series of 235 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the head and neck, 23% presented with extranodal involvement of the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, or larynx.1 However, none of these patients presented with bony involvement, highlighting the rare nature of our case. To our knowledge, we report the first case of neutrophil-rich, ALK-negative ALCL involving the mandible as the systemic extranodal presentation. This report also represents the first case of neutrophil-rich ALCL to present with stage IV systemic extranodal spread in an immune-competent patient.Anaplastic large cell lymphoma represents a subset of lymphomas that are defined by the malignant proliferation of large lymphoid cells with strong CD30 expression.2 First described by Stein et al3 in 1985, ALCL has been further divided into 3 main entities: primary systemic ALK-positive ALCL, primary systemic ALK-negative ALCL, and primary cutaneous ALCL.2 The rare neutrophil-rich histologic variant of ALCL that we report here was first identified by Mann et al4 in 1995, and has since been observed in both ALK-positive and ALK-negative subtypes.5,6Among 6 patients initially described with neutrophil-rich ALCL, Mann et al4 noted that the abundance of neutrophils on pathologic findings appeared to correlate with extranodal involvement of the muscle, skin, and lung. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions from such a small number of patients, the abundance of neutrophils on our patient’s pathologic findings, combined with the aggressive extranodal character of her disease, appears to support this trend.The aggressive nature of our patient’s disease also may be attributed to the lack of ALK expression. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase–negative ALCL tends to affect older patients and is characterized by a poor prognosis.2,7 Expression of ALK is caused by chromosomal translocations, including the most common translocation, t(2;5).2 Analysis of patients with the T-cell and null phenotype of ALCL showed a drastic difference in 5-year survival, at 93% for patients with ALK-positive ALCL and 37% for those with ALK-negative ALCL.7 However, the subset of patients with ALK-negative ALCL who also possess a DUSP22 (OMIM 616778) rearrangement have a favorable prognosis, similar to that of patients with ALK-positive disease.8 In addition to expanding our knowledge of a rare subtype of ALCL, this case highlights the aggressive nature of ALK-negative ALCL and the importance of including lymphomas in the differential diagnosis for a bone or soft-tissue mass of the head and neck.",Oncology,"A woman in her 70s with a history of sarcoidosis presented with progressive supraclavicular, facial, and mandibular swelling of 3 months’ duration.

This report also represents the first case of neutrophil-rich ALCL to present with stage IV systemic extranodal spread in an immune-competent patient.Anaplastic large cell lymphoma represents a subset of lymphomas that are defined by the malignant proliferation of large lymphoid cells with strong CD30 expression.2 First described by Stein et al3 in 1985, ALCL has been further divided into 3 main entities: primary systemic ALK-positive ALCL, primary systemic ALK-negative ALCL, and primary cutaneous ALCL.2 The rare neutrophil-rich histologic variant of ALCL that we report here was first identified by Mann et al4 in 1995, and has since been observed in both ALK-positive and ALK-negative subtypes.5,6Among 6 patients initially described with neutrophil-rich ALCL, Mann et al4 noted that the abundance of neutrophils on pathologic findings appeared to correlate with extranodal involvement of the muscle, skin, and lung. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions from such a small number of patients, the abundance of neutrophils on our patient’s pathologic findings, combined with the aggressive extranodal character of her disease, appears to support this trend.The aggressive nature of our patient’s disease also may be attributed to the lack of ALK expression. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase–negative ALCL tends to affect older patients and is characterized by a poor prognosis.2,7 Expression of ALK is caused by chromosomal translocations, including the most common translocation, t(2;5).2 Analysis of patients with the T-cell and null phenotype of ALCL showed a drastic difference in 5-year survival, at 93% for patients with ALK-positive ALCL and 37% for those with ALK-negative ALCL.7 However, the subset of patients with ALK-negative ALCL who also possess a DUSP22 (OMIM 616778) rearrangement have a favorable prognosis, similar to that of patients with ALK-positive disease.8 In addition to expanding our knowledge of a rare subtype of ALCL, this case highlights the aggressive nature of ALK-negative ALCL and the importance of including lymphomas in the differential diagnosis for a bone or soft-tissue mass of the head and neck.",Oncology,"A man in him 70s with a history of sarcoidosis presented with progressive supraclavicular, facial, and mandibular swelling of 3 months’ duration.

Samples from the left upper neck lymph node and mandible mass demonstrated a population of large atypical cells in a background of abundant neutrophils. The atypical cells were positive for CD30 (strong, uniform), CD4, TIA1, EMA (variable), and CD7 (dim, partial) and very rare atypical cells showed dim expression of CD5. The cells were negative for ALK, CD3, CD8, Pax-5, CD15, CD79a, CD20, CD138, S100, and pan-keratin. The Ki-67 proliferation index was high. Results of bone marrow biopsy showed involvement with CD30-positive ALCL.Following discussion among the surgeon, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and support staff in the multidisciplinary tumor conference, nonsurgical management was pursued. Chemoradiotherapy was begun using CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), with plans for subsequent consolidation radiotherapy.

Nodular melanoma,D,Nodular melanoma,"Cavernous lymphangiomas usually arise during infancy, with the most common sites being the neck and head. They appear as painless swellings that can be flesh-colored, blue, or red lesions and may ulcerate. They can be surgically removed but often regrow, creating a therapeutic challenge. However, angiogenesis has been reported to be inhibited successfully with sirolimus.1Nodular basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin cancer and often has rolled, pearly edges with a central ulceration, tends to grow slowly, and usually does not metastasize.2 On histological examination, there are nests of basaloid cells, with palisading strands of the cells at the periphery and haphazard arrangement of the central cells as well as a hyperchromatic nucleus with little cytoplasm.Squamous cell carcinomas usually occur on sun-exposed locations, may produce keratin resulting in a scaly or hornlike appearance, and may ulcerate and bleed.3 On histological examination, there are nests, sheets, and strands of atypical keratinocytes originating in the epidermis and infiltrating into the dermis. Immunohistochemistry shows keratin expression with a high molecular weight and epithelial membrane antigen.Melanomas represent only 4% of all dermatologic cancers but account for 80% of skin cancer–related deaths.4 Nodular malignant melanoma is common in fair-skinned persons and on sun-exposed areas of the body.5 Wide local excision is the treatment for primary melanoma, with resection margins based on lesion thickness (1-cm margins for melanomas less than 2 mm thick and 2-cm and 3-cm margins for lesions greater than 2 mm and 4 mm thick, respectively).6 Wide local excision has been shown to reduce recurrence rates, although there is no statistically significant effect on survival. Patients with Clark level 5 melanoma are associated with 5-year survival rates of 25% or less.7 Melanoma is almost 100% curable when diagnosed early but has poor survival when metastatic.8 Adjuvant interferon alfa has been approved since 1996 based on the results of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1684 trial9 of patients with stage IIB or III melanoma, which showed the benefit of high-dose interferon alfa on both relapse-free and overall survival.In this patient, histological examination showed atypical melanocytes within the epidermis and dermis. Immunohistological stains can show S-100, MART-1, and HMB-45 as well as other immunohistological markers. The patient underwent a wide local excision of the back mass and a left axillary lymph node dissection. Histological examination of the back mass revealed it was malignant nodular melanoma with vertical growth, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and Clark level 5 with invasion into the subcutaneous fat (Figure 2). Left axillary dissection revealed enlarged, matted lymph nodes. However, histopathological examination revealed only sinus histiocytosis without evidence of any malignancy. Malignant nodular melanoma with vertical growth, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and Clark level 5 with invasion into the subcutaneous fat was found on histological examination.The patient declined to undergo skin graft coverage for the lesion and allowed the wound to heal by secondary intention.

Deeper excisional biopsies were performed of the originally biopsied lesion and representative smaller papulonodules. These biopsy specimens demonstrated the classic histopathologic changes seen in hypertrophic lichen planus (HLP) (Figure, B). Hypertrophic lichen planus is a subtype of lichen planus, a common skin eruption characterized histologically by a bandlike (lichenoid) lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis and destruction of the basal layer of the epidermis (Figure, C).After 6 weeks of clobetasol propionate, 0.05%, a high-potency topical corticosteroid, applied under occlusion, near-complete resolution was noted.Antibodies that target the programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) are gaining acceptance in oncology for a variety of neoplasms. Activated T cells express PD-1 as an immune checkpoint receptor to mediate immunosuppression and immune tolerance. Tumor and stromal cells express immunosuppressive PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Thus, inhibition of PD-1 and its immunosuppressive ligands increase antitumor T-cell response and disinhibit T-cell tolerance.1 This has emerged as a therapeutic strategy in oncology, and 3 antibody inhibitors have gained US Food and Drug Administration approval since 2014: pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab. Pembrolizumab is approved for melanoma and non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while nivolumab is approved for squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC, renal cancer, melanoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma; atezolizumab is approved for bladder cancer.Checkpoint inhibition can induce autoimmune responses. Clinical observation of toxic effects from immune checkpoint inhibitors has led to the identification of immune-related adverse events, including dermatologic, hepatic, and gastrointestinal toxic effects. In agents targeting PD-1, a significant percentage of such adverse events appear in the skin,2-6 termed immune-related cutaneous adverse events.5 Lichenoid tissue reactions, eczema, and vitiligo appear to be the most common immune-related cutaneous adverse events with pembrolizumab, with lichenoid reactions observed in 17% of patients in a recent single institution cohort.5 While this patient’s skin reaction developed relatively early on in her treatment course, these events typically occur later in therapy. These immune-related cutaneous adverse events do not seem to be confined to pembrolizumab and are likely a class effect.The protypical lichenoid tissue reaction is lichen planus, a pruritic eruption found in the skin and mucous membranes.7 Clinical findings are polymorphic and range from classic flat-topped polygonal purple papules to bullous, erosive, and hypertrophic variants. Lichen planus has been associated with hepatitis C, medications, and certain dental hardware.7 It is often highly pruritic and symmetric and with a predilection for the lower extremities. A growing consensus suggests the etiology is a result of T-cell–mediated autoimmune damage to basal keratinocytes expressing self-antigens. In animal models, PD-1 pathway inhibition induces T-cell responses against self-antigens, resulting in keratinocyte apoptosis.8 Corticosteroids, whether topical, intralesional, or systemic, are the cornerstone of treatment.Histologically, HLP can mimic squamous cell carcinoma with marked psuedoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, thereby presenting a diagnostic challenge. In this patient, her initial superficial shave biopsy was read as a squamous cell carcinoma. Hypertrophic lichen planus can be distinguished histologically by the presence of a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis with associated pigment incontinence, resulting in destruction of the basal layer of the epidermis. In addition, paucity of atypical keratinocytes and hypergranulosis can help to differentiate HLP from squamous cell carcinoma. This distinction is important, because the morbidity and cost associated with the treatment of HLP is significantly lower than that of squamous cell carcinoma.The development of hypertrophic lichen planus in patients receiving pembrolizumab has emerged as a relatively common toxic effect in checkpoint inhibition,5 much as solitary BRAF inhibition is linked with the emergence of keratoacanthomas and squamous cell cancers.9 Indeed, some have proposed that cutaneous adverse effects are associated with better outcomes.4,10 Whether this is true, and whether they represent more potent immune activation, remains to be determined. Lichen planus and other immune-related cutaneous adverse events are likely to emerge with increasing frequency as the use of PD-1 inhibitors expands and combination therapies are studied.

The mass was therefore resected en bloc with the distal pancreas, spleen, left kidney, and left adrenal. On postoperative day 0, his leukocytosis resolved (white blood cell count, 6000/μL).Pathologic examination of the retroperitoneal mass identified a largely dedifferentiated liposarcoma (French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group [FNCLCC] grade 2) with associated well-differentiated components. The dedifferentiated component of the liposarcoma contained a prominent inflammatory infiltrate with numerous neutrophils and scattered eosinophils and plasma cells (described as an inflammatory malignant fibrous histiocytoma). The spleen showed red pulp expansion by a granulocytic proliferation. The kidney and adrenal gland were surrounded by the sarcoma but were otherwise normal.Retroperitoneal sarcomas are relatively rare tumors, of which liposarcomas are the most common variant. Inflammatory malignant fibrous histiocytoma is an even rarer subtype of liposarcoma. These tumors of mesenchymal origin are associated with a clinically significant systemic leukemoid reaction and contain a predominance of neutrophils and eosinophils. The exceptionally high white blood cell count associated with these masses, which often abruptly normalizes after resection, can easily lead to misdiagnosis as leukemia or infection. Bone marrow biopsy, when performed, can help differentiate leukemia from inflammatory malignant fibrous histiocytoma, in which a hypercellular bone marrow is found but without any monoclonal proliferation.Surgical resection is the principal treatment, and multiorgan en bloc resection is frequently required to obtain complete macroscopic excision of the mass. Chemotherapy is generally not useful. The effectiveness of radiation is controversial, given the absence of randomized clinical trial evidence showing survival benefit. Many still favor its use, especially in cases with the highest risk of recurrence, given the potential of radiotherapy to decrease local recurrence.1 Following surgical resection, a recurrent leukocytosis frequently marks disease recurrence.2 The leukocytosis associated with these masses led some to initially believe that they were of lymphomatous origin, but they are now considered a subtype of dedifferentiated liposarcoma based on immunohistochemical and genomic analysis.3",Surgery,"A man in his 30s presented to his primary care clinician after 2 years of worsening abdominal discomfort and an increasingly large recurrent umbilical hernia.

Her disease recurred 1 year later, and she underwent haplotype-matched allogeneic SCT 8 months prior to admission. Two months prior to admission, she developed graft-vs-host disease requiring high-dose prednisone, rituximab, and intravenous immunoglobulin. At the time of admission, she was receiving prednisone (40 mg/d) and tacrolimus for graft-vs-host disease and prophylaxis of infection with levofloxacin, valacyclovir, posaconazole, and thrice weekly dapsone. The patient lived with her family, including her son who recently had a cough. She was born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States 3 decades prior. She denied recent travel.On examination, her temperature was 38.3° C, pulse of 115 beats/min, blood pressure of 110/50 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed tachycardia, increased work of breathing and bibasilar crackles without wheezes. Her laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 4.2 × 106/mL (normal range, 3.4-10 × 106/mL), hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL (normal range, 12-15.5 g/dL [to convert g/dL to g/L, multiply by 10]), platelets of 45 × 106/mL (normal range, 140-450 × 106/mL), and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL (normal range, 0.5-1.0 mg/dL [to convert mg/dL to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). A chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral opacities without pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Initial empirical treatment included vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and oseltamivir. On hospital day 2, she was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed (Figure, A) and compared with a study 2 weeks prior when she was asymptomatic (Figure, B).A, Computed tomographic (CT) chest image obtained on admission demonstrates diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening. B, Computed tomographic chest image from 2 weeks prior demonstrates nearly normal lungs.Add trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and corticosteroids for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumoniaSwitch vancomycin to linezolid for refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia What Would You Do Next?",Add amikacin to cover multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter,Add trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and corticosteroids for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,Switch vancomycin to linezolid for refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia,Add liposomal amphotericin B to cover mucormycosis,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP),B,Add trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and corticosteroids for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,"The differential for diffuse ground-glass opacities on chest CT includes certain infectious etiologies, pulmonary edema, diffuse alveolar damage owing to infection or drugs, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. We considered infectious etiologies to be most likely given this patient’s profound immunosuppression, which included respiratory viruses (eg, parainfluenza, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus), cytomegalovirus, PJP, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.1 Among the provided answers, B is correct because the other infections are unlikely to present with diffuse ground-glass opacities on chest CT.In addition to her broad-spectrum coverage, she was started on intravenous TMP/SMZ (10 mg/kg/d) with methylprednisolone for PJP, as well as intravenous ganciclovir for possible cytomegalovirus. A broad respiratory viral panel returned negative for common respiratory pathogens. Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were negative, as were tests for Legionella, blastomycosis, and histoplasmosis. The serum β-D-glucan was more than 500 pg/mL (normal level, <60 pg/mL), galactomannan index was 0.15 (normal index, <0.5) and lactate dehydrogenase was 590 U/L (normal level, <199 U/L [to convert U/L to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). A cytomegalovirus  polymerase chain reaction returned at 2110 IU/mL, increased from 721 IU/mL 2 weeks prior. Bronchoscopy revealed numerous cyst forms on methenamine silver stain, consistent with Pneumocystis jiroveci.Despite treatment with high-dose TMP/SMZ and methylprednisolone, her respiratory and hemodynamic status did not improve, and she remained on multiple vasopressors. Her course was complicated by persistent respiratory failure owing to persistent infection and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome. She died on hospital day 48.Infectious pulmonary complications after SCT remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.2 The incidence of pneumonia 1 year after SCT ranges from 18% to 26% depending on the type of SCT.3 When an organism is identified, the most common culprits are bacterial (22%) and viral (21%) causes.3 Infection with PJP is less common (0.5%-5%), especially with prophylactic agents, but can occur.3-6 Graft-vs-host disease, lymphopenia, and age increase the risk of pneumonia.3,5,6 Despite treatment, death due to PJP in post-SCT patients is 30% to 50%.3,7 Poor prognostic factors include radiographic evidence of diffuse lung involvement and prolonged steroid use.7The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend PJP prophylaxis for at least the first 6 months after allogeneic SCT and in patients receiving T-cell depleting agents or high-dose steroids.8 Studied regimens include TMP/SMZ, dapsone, atovaquone and pentamidine.9 Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is the preferred agent in high-risk patients (ie, those receiving high-dose steroids),8 barring any absolute contraindications such as renal failure, severe cytopenias, or sulfa allergies.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin infection,Candida tropicalis,Leukemia cutis,Disseminated coccidioidomycosis,C. Leukemia cutis (LC),C,Leukemia cutis,"Post-SCT extramedullary relapse of AML is very rare with an incidence of 0.02% to 20.00% and may occur in an isolated fashion or in combination with medullary relapse.1 Myelomonocytic and monocytic subtypes are most commonly associated LC,2,3 and its incidence is higher in pediatric population. Most of the LC cases are described in patients with AML; however, it can also develop in myelodysplastic syndrome, accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.4The common sites of extramedullary AML are skin, bone, periosteum, soft tissue, and lymph nodes.5 Other commonly reported sites are those with less rigorous immune surveillance including testes, ovaries, and the central nervous system.5 Therefore, patients may present with soft tissue masses or lymphadenopathy and life-threatening complications such as spinal cord compression and extremity paresis.5 Cutaneous manifestations in LC are characterized by infiltration of leukemic cells into epidermis or dermis, causing single-to-multiple erythematous nodular or papular lesions that may be accompanied by ecchymosis, palpable purpura, bullous lesions, erythroderma, or ulcers. Most patients who received allogeneic SCT require post-SCT immunosuppressive agents to prevent graft-vs-host disease. Therefore, differential diagnoses of new skin lesions associated with recurrent fever are broad—including bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, and disease relapse—rendering LC a diagnostic challenge, especially when the marrow exam is negative.Risk factors associated with extramedullary relapse include French-American-British AML subtypes M4/M5 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.5; P = .02), age 18 years or younger (HR, 3.3; P = .006), pre-SCT extramedullary leukemia (HR, 4.6; P < .001), and refractory disease at the time of SCT (HR, 2.6; P = .02)1. Other cytogenetic abnormalities including del(5q) (32.1%), monosomy 7 (10.8%), trisomy 8 (10.4%), trisomy 4 (4.4%), del(20q) (2.4%), monosomy 16 (2.3%), and trisomy 11 (2.2%) are frequently associated with extramedullary leukemia6; however, their significance in the post-SCT relapse setting remains to be answered. The pathogenesis of extramedullary infiltration is ill-defined. Extramedullary migration is presumably initiated by altered expression of adhesion molecule that allows for the separation of leukemic cells from the bone marrow and mobilization into blood circulation.6 In a prior study7 of 331 patients with de novo AML, the CD56 positivity (defined as at least 20% of blasts expressing CD56 on flow-cytometry) was shown to be associated with significantly higher rate of extramedullary disease compared to CD56 negativity (53.1% vs 29.2%; P = .01), suggesting that CD56 may mediate extramedullary migration or tissue invasion. However, there was no significant intergroup difference in leukemic skin infiltration (3.1% vs 3.1%; P > .99), questioning the role of CD56 in LC pathogenesis7.Two-years overall survival rate in patients with extramedullary relapse was shown to be 11% to 38%, and the prognosis depends on the presence of concurrent medullary disease. Solh et al8 reported a significantly better 6-month survival rate in patients with isolated extramedullary relapse (69%) compared with those with medullary relapse (27%) or combined medullary and extramedullary relapse (8%).There is no standard treatment established for LC. Since graft-vs-leukemia effect plays an important role for cutaneous disease control, tapering immunosuppressive agents should be considered as an initial approach in patients without active graft-vs-host disease.6 In patients with good performance status and younger age, systemic chemotherapy could be a reasonable option as a next step. Previous retrospective study in 257 patients with AML and post-SCT extramedullary relapse showed nominally longer median survival with systemic chemotherapy compared with no treatment (120 vs 25 days)1. Adding donor lymphocyte infusion into the systemic chemotherapy resulted in further improvement in median survival (226 vs 120 days).1 Therefore, donor lymphocyte infusion  should be strongly considered if it is available. In patients who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy, DNA hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine could be an alternative option as shown in a recent case study.9 Hypomethylating agents induce leukemic cell differentiation as well as increase the expression of the human leukocyte antigen and tumor-associated antigens, which may potentiate the graft-vs-leukemia effect.10 In our patient, cyclosporine was tapered and azacitidine (75 mg/m2/d for 7 days) was started based on his poor performance status. The patient completed total 4 cycles of azacitidine treatment, and his disease is currently stable and has been for 8 months.",Oncology,"A 69-year-old man with a history of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) monocytic type presented with intermittent fever and fatigue 2 months after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT).

Leukemia cutis (LC),C,Leukemia cutis,"Post-SCT extramedullary relapse of AML is very rare with an incidence of 0.02% to 20.00% and may occur in an isolated fashion or in combination with medullary relapse.1 Myelomonocytic and monocytic subtypes are most commonly associated LC,2,3 and its incidence is higher in pediatric population. Most of the LC cases are described in patients with AML; however, it can also develop in myelodysplastic syndrome, accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.4The common sites of extramedullary AML are skin, bone, periosteum, soft tissue, and lymph nodes.5 Other commonly reported sites are those with less rigorous immune surveillance including testes, ovaries, and the central nervous system.5 Therefore, patients may present with soft tissue masses or lymphadenopathy and life-threatening complications such as spinal cord compression and extremity paresis.5 Cutaneous manifestations in LC are characterized by infiltration of leukemic cells into epidermis or dermis, causing single-to-multiple erythematous nodular or papular lesions that may be accompanied by ecchymosis, palpable purpura, bullous lesions, erythroderma, or ulcers. Most patients who received allogeneic SCT require post-SCT immunosuppressive agents to prevent graft-vs-host disease. Therefore, differential diagnoses of new skin lesions associated with recurrent fever are broad—including bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, and disease relapse—rendering LC a diagnostic challenge, especially when the marrow exam is negative.Risk factors associated with extramedullary relapse include French-American-British AML subtypes M4/M5 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.5; P = .02), age 18 years or younger (HR, 3.3; P = .006), pre-SCT extramedullary leukemia (HR, 4.6; P < .001), and refractory disease at the time of SCT (HR, 2.6; P = .02)1. Other cytogenetic abnormalities including del(5q) (32.1%), monosomy 7 (10.8%), trisomy 8 (10.4%), trisomy 4 (4.4%), del(20q) (2.4%), monosomy 16 (2.3%), and trisomy 11 (2.2%) are frequently associated with extramedullary leukemia6; however, their significance in the post-SCT relapse setting remains to be answered. The pathogenesis of extramedullary infiltration is ill-defined. Extramedullary migration is presumably initiated by altered expression of adhesion molecule that allows for the separation of leukemic cells from the bone marrow and mobilization into blood circulation.6 In a prior study7 of 331 patients with de novo AML, the CD56 positivity (defined as at least 20% of blasts expressing CD56 on flow-cytometry) was shown to be associated with significantly higher rate of extramedullary disease compared to CD56 negativity (53.1% vs 29.2%; P = .01), suggesting that CD56 may mediate extramedullary migration or tissue invasion. However, there was no significant intergroup difference in leukemic skin infiltration (3.1% vs 3.1%; P > .99), questioning the role of CD56 in LC pathogenesis7.Two-years overall survival rate in patients with extramedullary relapse was shown to be 11% to 38%, and the prognosis depends on the presence of concurrent medullary disease. Solh et al8 reported a significantly better 6-month survival rate in patients with isolated extramedullary relapse (69%) compared with those with medullary relapse (27%) or combined medullary and extramedullary relapse (8%).There is no standard treatment established for LC. Since graft-vs-leukemia effect plays an important role for cutaneous disease control, tapering immunosuppressive agents should be considered as an initial approach in patients without active graft-vs-host disease.6 In patients with good performance status and younger age, systemic chemotherapy could be a reasonable option as a next step. Previous retrospective study in 257 patients with AML and post-SCT extramedullary relapse showed nominally longer median survival with systemic chemotherapy compared with no treatment (120 vs 25 days)1. Adding donor lymphocyte infusion into the systemic chemotherapy resulted in further improvement in median survival (226 vs 120 days).1 Therefore, donor lymphocyte infusion  should be strongly considered if it is available. In patients who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy, DNA hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine could be an alternative option as shown in a recent case study.9 Hypomethylating agents induce leukemic cell differentiation as well as increase the expression of the human leukocyte antigen and tumor-associated antigens, which may potentiate the graft-vs-leukemia effect.10 In our patient, cyclosporine was tapered and azacitidine (75 mg/m2/d for 7 days) was started based on his poor performance status.

They tend to hang down either side of the pericardium, molding to the mediastinal structures.3 However, due to the predominant fat density, thymolipomas are difficult to diagnose on plain film. Chest tomography is the investigative procedure of choice; the pathognomonic finding is the predominant fat attenuation mixed with nodular elements that represent thymic tissue. Thymolipomas are distinct from thymomas, which do not have fatty elements, and mediastinal lipomatosis, which does not have these nodular elements. Thymolipomas are never associated with elevated tumor markers, including β-human chorionic gonadotropin, α-fetoprotein, or lactate dehydrogenase, differentiating them from germ cell tumors. Thymolipomas tumors can be mistaken for myelolipomas, which are very rare. On gross morphologic examination, thymic nests in thymolipomas are salmon-colored and dispersed throughout the predominantly fatty tumor (Figure 2). Histologic analysis of thymolipomas shows mature fat and thymic tissue with lack of Hassall corpuscles and intervening areas of fibrosis. In contrast, myelolipomas reveal hallmark bone marrow elements on histologic examination.4 Thymolipomas have been proposed to develop due to regression of a hyperplastic thymus, lipoma formation within thymic tissue, or hamartoma formation in the thymus.5Gross analysis.

Lymphomatoid papulosis,C,Lymphomatoid papulosis,"Lymphomatoid papulosis (LP) is characterized by chronic and recurrent cutaneous papules and nodules that spontaneously regress without treatment.1 The disease is more common in males, with a median age of 50 to 55 years at diagnosis. The life span of skin lesions typically ranges from 4 to 8 weeks but may last up to several months. Lesions are usually less than 2 cm in diameter and may occur in a solitary pattern or multiple crops involving any part of the body. Some patients have associated pruritus, which may heal with scar formation; however, accompanying constitutional symptoms are absent in most cases. Early lesions typically show a limited number of perivascular lymphocytes; however, large atypical cells accumulate in the advanced lesions.1 Furthermore, neutrophilic infiltration is frequently observed in the epidermis of the involved lesions.1Lymphomatoid papulosis is classified as a primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder along with primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL).2 Accordingly, LP is uniformly positive for CD30, and may be positive for CD25, CD71, CD3, CD4, CD8, and HLA-DR depending on subtypes.1 There are 6 major histopathologic subtypes (types A-E, LP with 6p23.5 rearrangement).3 Type A, the most common subtype, is characterized by a wedge-shaped infiltration of large atypical CD30-positive and inflammatory cells resembling Hodgkin lymphoma. Type B and C lesions show small and large atypical CD30-positive cell infiltration resembling mycosis fungoides (MF) and ALCL, respectively. Type D is characterized by epidermotropic infiltration of atypical CD30-positive/CD8-positive lymphoid cells resembling primary cutaneous cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma, and type E shows angiocentric infiltration of CD30-positive/CD8-positive small to large pleomorphic cells in dermis and blood vessels.3CD30 has been shown to interact with CD30L to activate the nuclear factor–κB pathway regulating cell death and proliferation in active B and T cells, but the mechanistic role of CD30 in LP remains unexplained.4 Other chromosomal and genetic abnormalities such as aneuploidy have been identified in LP although t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, a characteristic marker of systemic ALCL, is typically absent in LP.5 The underlying mechanisms of spontaneous regression in LP are largely unknown, although several hypotheses, including low and high expression of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 family proteins and higher apoptotic vs proliferation ratio, have been suggested.6Owing to variability in the results of histopathologic analysis depending on evolutionary course of disease, LP is often misdiagnosed. As well, the histologic patterns and immunophenotypes largely overlap with other cutaneous lymphoid malignant neoplasms such as primary cutaneous ALCL, transformed MF, Sézary syndrome, and adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. Because benign skin lesions from pityriasis lichenoides, lymphomatoid drug eruption, viral infection, and insect bites can mimic LP, a thorough history and physical examination, viral serologic testing, and expert pathologic review are essential in differentiating LP from other benign disease. Clinical features pointing toward a disorder other than LP include constitutional complaints, lymphadenopathy, and organomegaly. Moreover, molecular workup such as TCR gene rearrangement, flow cytometry, immunohistochemical staining, and cytogenetic testing is essential to differentiate LP from other malignant neoplasms including ALCL, MF, Sézary syndrome, and T-cell leukemia and lymphoma.The life expectancy of patients with LP is similar to that of the general population, but 10% to 25% develop other types of lymphoid malignant neoplasms such as MF (61%), cutaneous ALCL (26%), Hodgkin lymphoma (4%), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (4%).7 Male sex, subtypes B and C, and TCR-γ gene rearrangement have been shown to be associated with increased risk of lymphoma.7,8 Although the mechanisms of transformation remain elusive, monoclonal TCR gene rearrangement has been identified in both cutaneous lesions of LP and associated lymphoid malignant cells, supporting the clonal relationship between these 2 entities.9Asymptomatic patients with LP do not need treatment, and a watch-and-wait strategy is reasonable for them. Our patient remains on active surveillance without any new lesions at the time of publication. In symptomatic patients with extensive disease, oral methotrexate is the treatment of choice and efficacious at weekly doses of 5 to 25 mg.10",Oncology,"A man in his 30s with no medical history reported a 2-year history of waxing and waning pruritic papules involving his left popliteus, contralateral popliteus, groin, and penis with each lesion occurring at different time points.

Moreover, molecular workup such as TCR gene rearrangement, flow cytometry, immunohistochemical staining, and cytogenetic testing is essential to differentiate LP from other malignant neoplasms including ALCL, MF, Sézary syndrome, and T-cell leukemia and lymphoma.The life expectancy of patients with LP is similar to that of the general population, but 10% to 25% develop other types of lymphoid malignant neoplasms such as MF (61%), cutaneous ALCL (26%), Hodgkin lymphoma (4%), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (4%).7 Male sex, subtypes B and C, and TCR-γ gene rearrangement have been shown to be associated with increased risk of lymphoma.7,8 Although the mechanisms of transformation remain elusive, monoclonal TCR gene rearrangement has been identified in both cutaneous lesions of LP and associated lymphoid malignant cells, supporting the clonal relationship between these 2 entities.9Asymptomatic patients with LP do not need treatment, and a watch-and-wait strategy is reasonable for them.

Lymphomatoid papulosis,C,Lymphomatoid papulosis,"Lymphomatoid papulosis (LP) is characterized by chronic and recurrent cutaneous papules and nodules that spontaneously regress without treatment.1 The disease is more common in males, with a median age of 50 to 55 years at diagnosis. The life span of skin lesions typically ranges from 4 to 8 weeks but may last up to several months. Lesions are usually less than 2 cm in diameter and may occur in a solitary pattern or multiple crops involving any part of the body. Some patients have associated pruritus, which may heal with scar formation; however, accompanying constitutional symptoms are absent in most cases. Early lesions typically show a limited number of perivascular lymphocytes; however, large atypical cells accumulate in the advanced lesions.1 Furthermore, neutrophilic infiltration is frequently observed in the epidermis of the involved lesions.1Lymphomatoid papulosis is classified as a primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder along with primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL).2 Accordingly, LP is uniformly positive for CD30, and may be positive for CD25, CD71, CD3, CD4, CD8, and HLA-DR depending on subtypes.1 There are 6 major histopathologic subtypes (types A-E, LP with 6p23.5 rearrangement).3 Type A, the most common subtype, is characterized by a wedge-shaped infiltration of large atypical CD30-positive and inflammatory cells resembling Hodgkin lymphoma. Type B and C lesions show small and large atypical CD30-positive cell infiltration resembling mycosis fungoides (MF) and ALCL, respectively. Type D is characterized by epidermotropic infiltration of atypical CD30-positive/CD8-positive lymphoid cells resembling primary cutaneous cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma, and type E shows angiocentric infiltration of CD30-positive/CD8-positive small to large pleomorphic cells in dermis and blood vessels.3CD30 has been shown to interact with CD30L to activate the nuclear factor–κB pathway regulating cell death and proliferation in active B and T cells, but the mechanistic role of CD30 in LP remains unexplained.4 Other chromosomal and genetic abnormalities such as aneuploidy have been identified in LP although t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, a characteristic marker of systemic ALCL, is typically absent in LP.5 The underlying mechanisms of spontaneous regression in LP are largely unknown, although several hypotheses, including low and high expression of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 family proteins and higher apoptotic vs proliferation ratio, have been suggested.6Owing to variability in the results of histopathologic analysis depending on evolutionary course of disease, LP is often misdiagnosed. As well, the histologic patterns and immunophenotypes largely overlap with other cutaneous lymphoid malignant neoplasms such as primary cutaneous ALCL, transformed MF, Sézary syndrome, and adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. Because benign skin lesions from pityriasis lichenoides, lymphomatoid drug eruption, viral infection, and insect bites can mimic LP, a thorough history and physical examination, viral serologic testing, and expert pathologic review are essential in differentiating LP from other benign disease.

The representative computed tomographic images reveal multiple abdominal viscera (stomach, small bowel, colon, spleen, and pancreas) herniated into the left chest with near-complete left-lung atelectasis (Figure 1A). Differential diagnoses included type IV hiatal hernia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, diaphragm eventration, diaphragm paralysis, and blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm with delayed diagnosis. Complaints of dyspnea are common with each of these disorders owing to the intrathoracic displacement of abdominal contents with resulting restricted lung volumes. Chest radiography demonstrating air-fluid levels above the expected level of the diaphragm is also suggestive of any of these diagnoses. A detailed history and additional imaging are therefore required to determine the correct diagnosis.Computed tomography with reformatted, multiplanar images is currently the diagnostic modality of choice to detect and localize diaphragmatic defects.1,2 In this case, the selected images reveal a central left-diaphragm defect (Figure 1B), which was confirmed intraoperatively (Figure 2). Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are uncommon in adults and are found in distinctly different locations.3 Morgagni hernias result from anterior defects, typically to the right of the midline. Bochdalek hernias result from posterior diaphragmatic defects, most commonly on the left in adults. Type IV hiatal hernias can also present with impressive herniation of multiple viscera.

Diagnostic coronary angiography performed before the operation demonstrated that the stent at the proximal site of the left anterior descending artery was patent. However, the downstream blood flow was very poor, reflecting extensive transmural infarction of the left ventricle myocardium. Such a large territory of necrosis might be related to delayed reperfusion or reperfusion injury after coronary intervention. Because of the large area of transmural necrosis of the left ventricle with poor cardiac output, end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed. The patient was put on the transplant waiting list.

Differentiation among pericardial hematoma, intramyocardial hemorrhage, or intracavity thrombus by noninvasive imaging is challenging. Sometimes the correct diagnosis cannot be made without explorative operation. Nevertheless, it is important to be aware of the possibility of intramyocardial hemorrhage.

Mucus and/or blood in the stool, along with abdominal pain and cramping, is suggestive of colitis instead of simple diarrhea.The diagnosis of idelalisib-associated diarrhea should be considered in any patient developing diarrhea while taking the drug, although infectious causes must be ruled out. The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events can be used to define grades of diarrhea and colitis.4 Specific serological or stool tests are not available.5 The role of imaging is primarily to evaluate for bowel perforation, obstruction, and toxic megacolon.The time course to develop diarrhea after initiating idelalisib varies. Two distinct patterns of diarrhea have been observed: an early (within 2 months of initiating therapy) grade 1-2 diarrhea that responds well to conservative therapy, and a delayed form that is usually severe and requires more definitive therapy.2 Consistent with these descriptions, the median time to development of grade 1-2 vs grade 3-4 diarrhea is 1.5 months vs 7.1 months. It is important for clinicians to recognize that idelalisib can cause severe late diarrhea after patients seem to initially tolerate the drug.2 Several newer, targeted anticancer drugs (eg, ipilimumab) are associated with development of treatment-related diarrhea and colitis.6 Patients with gastrointestinal toxicity should also be evaluated for development of other immune-mediated adverse effects such as rash, transaminitis, and pneumonitis.Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is indicated in patients with grade 3-4 symptoms, frank bleeding, or persistent diarrhea despite supportive therapy.6 Colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy can demonstrate inflammatory changes, erosions or ulcers, mucosal erythema, congestion, granularity, or decreased vascular pattern.7 Normal results of endoscopic examination do not rule out colitis, and biopsies must always be performed.8 Cytomegalovirus infection should be ruled out via immunohistochemical staining. This patient’s biopsy demonstrated moderately active colitis with evidence of cryptitis, crypt abscess, increased apoptotic bodies, and crypt atrophy/degeneration with reactive epithelial changes. These findings, along with intraepithelial lymphocytosis, are the most distinct histopathological findings in idelalisib-associated colitis (Figure).7 Spontaneous colitis has been reported in PI3K knockout mice.9 From a mechanistic standpoint, it is hypothesized that immune dysregulation characterized by an altered cytokine profile, hyperresponsive macrophages, and cellular damage by cytotoxic CD8+ cells are responsible for colitis in patients receiving idelalisib.8,9Although follicular lymphoma can rarely involve the colon, an adequate biopsy sample is usually sufficient for diagnosis, or in this case, excluding gastrointestinal lymphoma. Graft-vs-host disease can cause crypt cell apoptosis but tends to be pauci-inflammatory. The absence of stem cell transplantation in this patient’s history is a clue. Cytomegalovirus can induce crypt apoptosis and cryptitis although viral inclusions are readily apparent. Mesenteric ischemia is classically associated with petechiae, abrupt transition between normal and affected mucosa, and rectal sparing on colonoscopy.Uncomplicated diarrhea is managed with supportive therapy including fluid replenishment, antidiarrheal therapy, and diet modification. Persistent grade 2 or grade 3-4 symptoms usually require steroid therapy; initial treatment with up to 1 mg/kg of prednisone or equivalent may be required. This patient’s condition did not improve with supportive therapy alone. Intravenous methylprednisone was initiated and transitioned to a 4-week oral prednisone taper.

The obturator nerve divides into anterior and posterior divisions, which are separated by the adductor brevis muscle. The anatomic distribution of the obturator nerve provides potential space for bowel herniation in 3 ways.1 Tissue laxity of the supporting fascia in the pelvis contributes to an obturator hernia (OH), especially in older women, multiparous women, and patients with a low body mass index. Small-bowel obstruction is the main presentation for most patients with an OH.2On physical examination, maneuvers to compress the obturator nerve to reproduce the Howship-Romberg sign or Hannington-Kiff sign are unsatisfactory if patients have a hip joint disability or knee arthritis.3 The pectineus muscle can conceal a herniated mass from the obturator canal. Therefore, an obscure induration at the medial thigh could be missed. However, with computed tomography, both diagnosis and preoperative evaluation are facilitated. In female patients, an OH could be mistaken as a femoral hernia and lead to an inappropriate surgical plan. We prefer to recognize the pectineus muscle as the landmark.

She was a sheep breeder and was in close contact with animals for 8 to 12 hours every day.During physical examination, the heart and the lungs were normal.

The laboratory test results, including carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels, were all within normal ranges, except for a mild increase in the carbohydrate antigen 72-4 level, which was 11.89 U/mL (normal range, 0-6.9 U/mL).A, Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large, well-defined, cystic mass with mural calcification in the spleen.

Secondary splenic cyst,C,Secondary splenic cyst,"A histological examination revealed that the cyst wall consisted of fibrous tissue with no evidence of an epithelial lining, and calcification was found in the fibrotic wall (Figure 2). Normal splenic tissue was identified on the outer periphery, and Echinococcus species were not found.Histologic examination showed that the cyst wall consisted of fibrous tissue with no evidence of an epithelial lining, and calcification (arrowhead) was found in the fibrotic wall (original magnification ×100).Cysts of the spleen, occurring in only 0.5% to 2% of the population, are rarely found in clinical practice and are the least frequently encountered cystic disease involving abdominal viscera.1 In a recent classification based on the pathogenesis of cysts, splenic cysts were classified as parasitic or nonparasitic. Parasitic cysts are usually seen in endemic areas and are mostly caused by Echinococcus granulosus. Based on the presence or absence of an epithelial lining of the lumen, nonparasitic cysts are further subdivided into primary cysts, including congenital and neoplastic, and secondary cysts, including traumatic and necrotic,2 which are also called false cysts or pseudocysts.3An accurate preoperative diagnosis of primary or secondary cysts is sometimes difficult. However, because epithelial cells are often positive for carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen as detected by immunochemistry and because patients with epithelial cysts may have elevated levels of serum tumor-associated antigens, the elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9 or carcinoembryonic antigen levels may contribute to the differential diagnosis of primary or secondary cysts. In addition, both primary and secondary cysts are usually simple spherical cystic lesions, but the secondary cysts are more likely to present with peripheral calcifications. The most common cause of calcified splenic cysts is infection by E granulosus, but hydatid cysts usually have multiple compartments, and the organism is rare outside its normal geographic distribution. A single, annular, splenic calcification most likely represents a traumatic cyst in areas not endemic for Echinococcus species. In this case, the finding of cholesterol crystals suggests that the cyst was in fact an old hematoma, although no hematoidin crystals or other blood elements were found.4Splenic cysts occasionally become symptomatic by the compression of adjacent organs or, less commonly, by the development of complications such as hemorrhage, infection, or even chemical peritonitis due to the rupture of a hydatid cyst. Surgery is not only the main treatment for symptomatic splenic cysts but may also be indicated for large asymptomatic splenic cysts for the likelihood of spontaneous rupture, which has ever been reported.5 Recently, spleen-preserving operations have become increasingly common and are reserved for solitary, small, and superficial benign cysts. In contrast, a total splenectomy is probably better suited for either large cysts that take up most of the splenic parenchyma, or neoplastic or hydatid cysts to prevent local tumor recurrence or dissemination of peritoneal echinococcosis.6",Surgery,"A man in his mid-50s was referred to our hospital because he had a cystic mass in his spleen that was discovered incidentally during a routine physical examination.

In this case, the finding of cholesterol crystals suggests that the cyst was in fact an old hematoma, although no hematoidin crystals or other blood elements were found.4Splenic cysts occasionally become symptomatic by the compression of adjacent organs or, less commonly, by the development of complications such as hemorrhage, infection, or even chemical peritonitis due to the rupture of a hydatid cyst. Surgery is not only the main treatment for symptomatic splenic cysts but may also be indicated for large asymptomatic splenic cysts for the likelihood of spontaneous rupture, which has ever been reported.5 Recently, spleen-preserving operations have become increasingly common and are reserved for solitary, small, and superficial benign cysts. In contrast, a total splenectomy is probably better suited for either large cysts that take up most of the splenic parenchyma, or neoplastic or hydatid cysts to prevent local tumor recurrence or dissemination of peritoneal echinococcosis.6",Surgery,"A patient in their mid-50s was referred to our hospital because they had a cystic mass in their spleen that was discovered incidentally during a routine physical examination. They had no history of abdominal trauma, infection, or surgery. A physical examination revealed mild tenderness over the posterior left upper quadrant. A precontrast computed tomographic scan revealed a large, well-defined, cystic mass (7 by 6 cm) with mural calcification in the spleen (Figure 1A), and the cyst was not enhanced in the arterial phase. The laboratory test results, including carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels, were all within normal ranges, except for a mild increase in the carbohydrate antigen 72-4 level, which was 11.89 U/mL (normal range, 0-6.9 U/mL).A, Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large, well-defined, cystic mass with mural calcification in the spleen. B, The surface of the cyst was extremely dense and appeared to have an eggshell-like calcification; the cyst was filled with about 300 mL of yellowish opalescent fluid containing numerous cholesterol-like crystals (arrowhead).During a laparotomy, a huge hard mass, which was partially covered by fibrous and necrotic tissue, was found emerging from the lower pole of the spleen. A total splenectomy was performed, and a gross pathologic examination revealed that the lower end of the spleen was occupied by a cyst, the surface of which was extremely dense and appeared to have an eggshell-like calcification (Figure 1B). The cyst was filled with about 300 mL of yellowish opalescent fluid containing numerous cholesterol-like crystals (Figure 1B).",what is your diagnosis?,What is your diagnosis?,Congenital splenic cyst,Secondary splenic cyst,Splenic abscess,Echinococcal disease,b,1,1,1,1,neutral,0,0,55.0,51-60,,1118,augmented_neutral_frommale

Primary lymphoma of bone,C,Primary lymphoma of bone,"Immunohistochemical staining of a biopsy specimen of the left proximal femur lesion showed positive results for CD10, CD20, CD45, BCL2, BCL6, and MUM1, consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), germinal center subtype (Figure 1C). Complete staging with positron emission tomography–computed tomography (FDG/PET-CT) revealed increased metabolic activity in the left femoral shaft (standardized uptake value [SUV], 20.6) with additional uptake in the left proximal humerus (SUV, 5.4), right proximal humerus (SUV, 6.2), multiple ribs, mid-thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies, left inguinal lymph node (SUV, 32), and mild heterogeneous uptake in the spleen. A diagnosis of multifocal primary lymphoma of bone (PLB) was made. Given the high risk of fracture, the patient underwent intramedullary nail insertion prior to discharge.PLB was first reported in 1928 and subsequently classified as a distinct clinicopathologic entity in a case series published in 1939.1 Histologically, most PLB cases are DLBCL subtype, although Hodgkin lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and T-cell lymphoma have been described.2 Currently, PLB corresponds to 2 groups: a single skeletal site, with or without regional lymph node involvement, or multifocal bone involvement with no visceral disease.3 PLB accounts for 7% of malignant bone tumors, 5% of extranodal lymphomas, and less than 1% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas.2 Skeletal involvement in DLBCL refers to the presence of bone lesions in addition to multiple lymph node or visceral involvement. While extranodal disease DLBCL occurs in two-thirds of patients, only 7% of DLBCL cases present with secondary bone involvement.4 Distinguishing between PLB and DLBCL with bony involvement is critical given the distinct outcomes of these 2 entities. However, clinical judgment is often required to make this classification given an absence of clear diagnostic criteria.5Although PLB involving a solitary lesion is considered to have a favorable prognosis, prospective data are lacking regarding multifocal PLB. The IELSG 14 study6 retrospectively examined 499 cases of bone lymphoma. The 37 patients with multifocal PLB demonstrated a statistically significant better response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival compared with 63 patients with stage IV DLBCL with skeletal involvement.6 Treatment with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen was consistent between the 2 arms, and use of consolidative involved field radiation was confirmed in multivariate analysis as an independent predictor for improved survival. Another retrospective review7 examined 102 patients with PLB, of which 47% had multifocal disease, treated at a single institution over a 25-year period. The addition of radiation therapy to anthracycline-based chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival with a trend toward improved overall survival.7Radiographic findings of PLB are often nonspecific. Most cases involve long bones with evidence of a lytic or mixed-density lesion on plain radiography.8 Increased use of functional imaging underlies the growing number of multifocal PLB cases given that FDG/PET-CT has a higher sensitivity and specificity for osseous involvement from lymphoma.5 Recent studies9 confirm improved accuracy in diagnosing PLB using FDG/PET-CT compared with CT alone. As in the case described herein, use of FDG/PET-CT often reveals additional lesions consistent with multifocal PLB resulting in upstaging at time of diagnosis.This patient had stage IV multifocal PLB. Proposed treatment consisted of 6 cycles of R-CHOP with 4 doses of prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy given the presence of high-risk spinal lesions, followed by consolidative radiation therapy to her presenting left femur lesion.6 This case illustrates the importance of functional imaging to accurately stage individuals with PLB and underscores the need for clear clinical guidelines to establish a diagnosis of multifocal PLB.",Oncology,"A white woman in her 60s with a medical history of multiple joint replacements related to osteoarthritis presented with left leg pain.

Complete staging with positron emission tomography–computed tomography (FDG/PET-CT) revealed increased metabolic activity in the left femoral shaft (standardized uptake value [SUV], 20.6) with additional uptake in the left proximal humerus (SUV, 5.4), right proximal humerus (SUV, 6.2), multiple ribs, mid-thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies, left inguinal lymph node (SUV, 32), and mild heterogeneous uptake in the spleen. A diagnosis of multifocal primary lymphoma of bone (PLB) was made. Given the high risk of fracture, the patient underwent intramedullary nail insertion prior to discharge.PLB was first reported in 1928 and subsequently classified as a distinct clinicopathologic entity in a case series published in 1939.1 Histologically, most PLB cases are DLBCL subtype, although Hodgkin lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and T-cell lymphoma have been described.2 Currently, PLB corresponds to 2 groups: a single skeletal site, with or without regional lymph node involvement, or multifocal bone involvement with no visceral disease.3 PLB accounts for 7% of malignant bone tumors, 5% of extranodal lymphomas, and less than 1% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas.2 Skeletal involvement in DLBCL refers to the presence of bone lesions in addition to multiple lymph node or visceral involvement. While extranodal disease DLBCL occurs in two-thirds of patients, only 7% of DLBCL cases present with secondary bone involvement.4 Distinguishing between PLB and DLBCL with bony involvement is critical given the distinct outcomes of these 2 entities. However, clinical judgment is often required to make this classification given an absence of clear diagnostic criteria.5Although PLB involving a solitary lesion is considered to have a favorable prognosis, prospective data are lacking regarding multifocal PLB. The IELSG 14 study6 retrospectively examined 499 cases of bone lymphoma. The 37 patients with multifocal PLB demonstrated a statistically significant better response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival compared with 63 patients with stage IV DLBCL with skeletal involvement.6 Treatment with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen was consistent between the 2 arms, and use of consolidative involved field radiation was confirmed in multivariate analysis as an independent predictor for improved survival. Another retrospective review7 examined 102 patients with PLB, of which 47% had multifocal disease, treated at a single institution over a 25-year period. The addition of radiation therapy to anthracycline-based chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival with a trend toward improved overall survival.7Radiographic findings of PLB are often nonspecific. Most cases involve long bones with evidence of a lytic or mixed-density lesion on plain radiography.8 Increased use of functional imaging underlies the growing number of multifocal PLB cases given that FDG/PET-CT has a higher sensitivity and specificity for osseous involvement from lymphoma.5 Recent studies9 confirm improved accuracy in diagnosing PLB using FDG/PET-CT compared with CT alone.

She was found to have severely elevated blood pressure at an urgent care center, prompting her transfer to the hospital. On review of systems, she endorsed anorexia and malaise for the past several days. She was in no acute distress but appeared languid. Her blood pressure was 210/110 mm Hg. Physical examination demonstrated periorbital and 1+ bipedal pitting edema. She had mild tenderness to percussion of both flanks.Serum studies revealed a creatinine level of 13 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), potassium level of 6.6 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0), and bicarbonate level of 16 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0).

Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed severe bilateral hydronephrosis with renal cortical thinning and obstructing calculi at both ureteropelvic junctions (Figure 1). The patient underwent emergent dialysis followed by placement of bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. Subsequently, her blood pressure normalized, edema improved, hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis resolved, and serum creatinine level decreased to 1.6 mg/dL. Interestingly, her serum calcium level elevated to 12 mg/dL and her serum phosphate level became low at 2.4 mg/dL.Computed tomographic scans of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast, showing obstructing calculi bilaterally at the ureteropelvic junctions (arrowheads) with resultant severe hydronephrosis and renal cortical thinning (A) and significant renal stone burden in the lower pole of the left kidney (B). What Is Your Diagnosis?",Hypervitaminosis D,Malignant neoplasm,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Sarcoidosis,C. Primary hyperparathyroidism,C,Primary hyperparathyroidism,"Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a disorder of calcium and phosphate metabolism secondary to excess production of parathyroid hormone, most commonly by a parathyroid adenoma.1 Although a diagnosis is most commonly established during workup for incidental hypercalcemia, PHPT may be heralded by vague constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia.2 It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis as approximately 20% of patients develop urologic stone disease.3 Although the stones are predominantly composed of calcium oxalate, they can be composed of calcium phosphate in the setting of alkalinized urine.4 The etiology of stone formation in PHPT is multifactorial and includes increased urinary calcium excretion as well as dehydration induced by the diuretic effect of the high urinary calcium burden. Additionally, calcium deposition within nephrons may result in nephrocalcinosis and renal functional decline.5This patient presented with severe azotemia and uremia secondary to obstructing bilateral ureteropelvic junction stones. Massive hydronephrosis in the setting of marked cortical thinning suggests that the obstruction was chronic. Interestingly, her serum calcium level was low and phosphate level high at initial evaluation, a profile typical for advanced renal insufficiency. This is likely to have resulted from the impaired filtration of phosphate and resultant precipitation with serum calcium leading to hypocalcemia. Only after correction of her acute renal insufficiency was an underlying hypercalcemic state unmasked.The presence of an elevated serum calcium level in the setting of a low serum phosphate level was suspicious for PHPT. Serum parathyroid hormone levels following resolution of her renal insufficiency were considerably elevated, confirming the diagnosis. A sestamibi scan revealed a solitary hyperactive focus in the right inferior parathyroid gland, suggestive of a parathyroid adenoma.Owing to the large renal stone burden, the patient has since undergone bilateral percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Intraoperatively, calculi impacted at both ureteropelvic junctions were encountered and successfully cleared along with the remaining renal stones (Figure 2). Biochemical analysis revealed the stones to be calcium oxalate monohydrate. Current guidelines dictate that the presence of renal stones in patients with PHPT, even when asymptomatic, is an absolute indication for parathyroidectomy.6 As such, the patient underwent parathyroidectomy, which revealed a 2.5-cm, 2.69-g adenomatous right inferior gland. Her parathyroid hormone level, which ranged between 130 and 150 pg/mL intraoperatively (to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1.0), has improved to 30 pg/mL—consistent with biochemical cure. At approximately 6 months postoperatively, her creatinine level has decreased to 1.4 mg/dL and she remains both symptom free and stone free.Percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Renal stones were embedded within the calyx of the left kidney. Grasping forceps inserted through the nephroscope were used to remove the stones from the kidney.",Surgery,"A 49-year-old woman with no relevant medical history presented with a 2-day history of headache and facial swelling.

Primary hyperparathyroidism,C,Primary hyperparathyroidism,"Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a disorder of calcium and phosphate metabolism secondary to excess production of parathyroid hormone, most commonly by a parathyroid adenoma.1 Although a diagnosis is most commonly established during workup for incidental hypercalcemia, PHPT may be heralded by vague constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia.2 It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis as approximately 20% of patients develop urologic stone disease.3 Although the stones are predominantly composed of calcium oxalate, they can be composed of calcium phosphate in the setting of alkalinized urine.4 The etiology of stone formation in PHPT is multifactorial and includes increased urinary calcium excretion as well as dehydration induced by the diuretic effect of the high urinary calcium burden. Additionally, calcium deposition within nephrons may result in nephrocalcinosis and renal functional decline.5This patient presented with severe azotemia and uremia secondary to obstructing bilateral ureteropelvic junction stones. Massive hydronephrosis in the setting of marked cortical thinning suggests that the obstruction was chronic. Interestingly, her serum calcium level was low and phosphate level high at initial evaluation, a profile typical for advanced renal insufficiency. This is likely to have resulted from the impaired filtration of phosphate and resultant precipitation with serum calcium leading to hypocalcemia.

Myeloid sarcoma,B,Myeloid sarcoma,"A bone marrow biopsy was repeated and demonstrated persistent MDS with 10% blasts and an abnormal karyotype: 46,XY,del(16)(q11.1). The patient was referred to the oral medicine unit for further evaluation and treatment of the isolated lip lesion. A fine-needle aspiration was performed, which revealed atypical mononuclear cells suspicious for blasts, and flow cytometry demonstrated the following immunophenotype consistent with myeloid sarcoma: CD45(dim)+ CD11B+ CD13+ CD33(var)+ CD34− CD64(predominantly)−CD117(var)+ HLA-DR(predominantly)−.Myeloid sarcoma is a rare extramedullary tumor of immature myeloid cells, or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the solid tumor phase. It occurs in less than 10% of patients with AML and only rarely antedates systemic bone marrow AML.1 In MDS, the incidence of myeloid sarcoma is less well characterized, but in the 30-year period from January 1965 to January 1994, only 46 cases of extramedullary myeloid tumor (including leukemia cutis) were reported.2 Interestingly, AML with bone marrow involvement developed in only 47% of these patients at a mean of 38 weeks from the initial extramedullary myeloid tumor.2 The much lower incidence of progression to AML with bone marrow involvement in MDS-associated myeloid sarcoma stands in contrast to truly isolated myeloid sarcoma, in which progression to AML with bone marrow involvement invariably occurs. Perhaps owing to the much lower incidence of progression to overt AML in MDS-associated myeloid sarcoma, patients who received chemotherapy for MDS-associated myeloid sarcoma demonstrated inferior survival compared with those who received conservative therapy only.2In addition to myeloid sarcoma and leukemia cutis, MDS can have protean autoimmune manifestations that have an effect on multiple organ systems. Of patients with MDS, 10% to 30% show signs of autoimmune disease, including vasculitis, seronegative polyarthritis, and skin lesions, including Sweet syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum.3 Treatment for autoimmune manifestations of MDS includes corticosteroids and treatment for the underlying disease, the mainstay of which in high-risk disease is hypomethylating agents.Myeloid sarcoma most frequently occurs in the soft tissues, bones, periosteum and lymph nodes.1 Intraoral myeloid sarcoma lesions are rare and commonly present as a symptomatic enlargement of the gingiva, palate and/or buccal mucosa.4,5 Intraoral lesions are considered clinically aggressive with possible invasion of adjacent soft and/or hard tissues.4 These tumors often have a nonspecific clinical and histological appearance; however, immunohistochemical analysis can establish a definitive diagnosis.6,7Isolated myeloid sarcoma invariably is followed by systemic involvement with acute myeloid leukemia and, therefore, if the patient is an appropriate candidate for intensive induction chemotherapy, he or she should be treated with such, similar to systemic AML. In addition, radiation therapy can have a role in the treatment of myeloid sarcoma. It can be used as a consolidative strategy following induction chemotherapy for isolated myeloid sarcoma, for rapid debulking and symptom control, or for palliation in patients who are not appropriate candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy.1In the case described herein, age and comorbid conditions precluded treatment with intensive induction chemotherapy, and the myeloid sarcoma was treated with radiation therapy. The patient received 30 Gy in 15 fractions via 9 MeV electron therapy with complete response. It is known that radiation therapy can achieve durable disease control at the targeted site,8 though the therapy is not definitive if there is bone marrow involvement with malignant abnormalities.With regard to his bone marrow disease, the patient began therapy with 5-azacitadine, 75 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5 and 8 to 9 each month. After 3 cycles, his hemoglobin level and platelet counts normalized and his absolute neutrophil count was approximately 800/μL. He has not been hospitalized and enjoys a good quality of life with mild fatigue continuing to be his major symptom. Interestingly, his del(16)(q11.1) cytogenetic abnormality had been previously described as being associated with myeloid sarcoma.9 This case highlights development of myeloid sarcoma in patients who do not have frank involvement with AML in the bone marrow. Suspicion of myeloid sarcoma was heightened because the patient demonstrated clinical signs of MDS progression.",Oncology,"A man in his 70s with hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) presented for a second opinion regarding treatment of MDS.

It occurs in less than 10% of patients with AML and only rarely antedates systemic bone marrow AML.1 In MDS, the incidence of myeloid sarcoma is less well characterized, but in the 30-year period from January 1965 to January 1994, only 46 cases of extramedullary myeloid tumor (including leukemia cutis) were reported.2 Interestingly, AML with bone marrow involvement developed in only 47% of these patients at a mean of 38 weeks from the initial extramedullary myeloid tumor.2 The much lower incidence of progression to AML with bone marrow involvement in MDS-associated myeloid sarcoma stands in contrast to truly isolated myeloid sarcoma, in which progression to AML with bone marrow involvement invariably occurs. Perhaps owing to the much lower incidence of progression to overt AML in MDS-associated myeloid sarcoma, patients who received chemotherapy for MDS-associated myeloid sarcoma demonstrated inferior survival compared with those who received conservative therapy only.2In addition to myeloid sarcoma and leukemia cutis, MDS can have protean autoimmune manifestations that have an effect on multiple organ systems. Of patients with MDS, 10% to 30% show signs of autoimmune disease, including vasculitis, seronegative polyarthritis, and skin lesions, including Sweet syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum.3 Treatment for autoimmune manifestations of MDS includes corticosteroids and treatment for the underlying disease, the mainstay of which in high-risk disease is hypomethylating agents.Myeloid sarcoma most frequently occurs in the soft tissues, bones, periosteum and lymph nodes.1 Intraoral myeloid sarcoma lesions are rare and commonly present as a symptomatic enlargement of the gingiva, palate and/or buccal mucosa.4,5 Intraoral lesions are considered clinically aggressive with possible invasion of adjacent soft and/or hard tissues.4 These tumors often have a nonspecific clinical and histological appearance; however, immunohistochemical analysis can establish a definitive diagnosis.6,7Isolated myeloid sarcoma invariably is followed by systemic involvement with acute myeloid leukemia and, therefore, if the patient is an appropriate candidate for intensive induction chemotherapy, he or she should be treated with such, similar to systemic AML. In addition, radiation therapy can have a role in the treatment of myeloid sarcoma.

Substernal goiter,D,Substernal goiter,"The anterior mediastinum is the most common site of mediastinal masses, which are most commonly goiters, thymomas, teratomas, mediastinal metastases, or lymphomas, with clinical and radiologic features aiding in the diagnosis.1 Substernal goiter has been the focus of surgical luminaries from Kocher2 to Lahey3 since its first characterization in 1749.4 Its pathophysiology is surmised to stem from a deficiency in iodine that can lead to decreased thyronine levels and a compensatory elevation in thyrotropin, thus causing thyroid hypertrophy and the development of goiter.5 The classic presentation is that of a woman in her fifth decade with an anterior mediastinal mass arising from the lower pole of the thyroid gland, supplied by the inferior thyroid artery. The theory behind this pattern of growth is the presence of anatomical barriers around the gland, superiorly by the thyroid and cricoid cartilage, posteriorly by the prevertebral fascia, and anteriorly by the strap muscles, leaving only the inferior area without a barrier to growth. Furthermore, the negative intrathoracic pressure accompanying swallowing and aided by gravity is thought to slowly bring an enlarging goiter to its substernal resting place.5 The majority of goiters are benign and are most commonly of the nodular goiter subtype.5Most patients tend to be asymptomatic, with only the occasional complaint of dysphagia related to mass effect. Computed tomography of the neck and chest is helpful in discerning anatomic relationships between the mass and adjacent structures, and in aiding preoperative planning.6 The treatment of choice for substernal goiter is surgical excision.5 The technical considerations of surgery deviate only slightly from traditional thyroidectomy; careful dissection is essential in locating the recurrent laryngeal nerve. With planar dissection, the goiter is then “delivered” into the cervical region.7 Traditional predictors of substernal goiters that require sternotomy include invasive thyroid cancers, a previous thyroidectomy, superior vena cava syndrome, isolated primary mediastinal tumors, a posterior mediastinal location, extension below the aortic arch, a gland mass of greater than 260 g, or an intrathoracic independent blood supply.7,8 Finally, while rare, tracheomalacia must be considered; although compression of the trachea can weaken the cartilage initially, the trachea may become dependent on the mass as a buttress.9 Following mass excision, airway collapse and negative-pressure pulmonary edema are chief concerns. These are best avoided with prolonged intubation and, occasionally, by a tracheostomy.9 Repair by tracheopexy with various meshes has been described.9 Novel approaches involving video-assisted thoracoscopic resection of mediastinal goiters have gained acceptance and represent an innovative solution to spare selected patients’ from undergoing a sternotomy.10",Surgery,"An asymptomatic 47-year-old woman underwent a radiographic screening to rule out tuberculosis prior to volunteering at her local hospital.

The theory behind this pattern of growth is the presence of anatomical barriers around the gland, superiorly by the thyroid and cricoid cartilage, posteriorly by the prevertebral fascia, and anteriorly by the strap muscles, leaving only the inferior area without a barrier to growth. Furthermore, the negative intrathoracic pressure accompanying swallowing and aided by gravity is thought to slowly bring an enlarging goiter to its substernal resting place.5 The majority of goiters are benign and are most commonly of the nodular goiter subtype.5Most patients tend to be asymptomatic, with only the occasional complaint of dysphagia related to mass effect. Computed tomography of the neck and chest is helpful in discerning anatomic relationships between the mass and adjacent structures, and in aiding preoperative planning.6 The treatment of choice for substernal goiter is surgical excision.5 The technical considerations of surgery deviate only slightly from traditional thyroidectomy; careful dissection is essential in locating the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

She has a mildly elevated ESR and hemodynamically significant suprainguinal occlusive disease. Imaging revealed subclavian artery and infrarenal aortic stenoses. These findings are suggestive of Takayasu arteritis (TA).1Takayasu arteritis is an immune-mediated inflammatory arteritis of the aorta and its major branches occurring before the fourth decade of life with a female to male ratio of approximately 3:1.2 Concomitant cardiac and visceral artery involvement is also observed in some patients. The incidence of TA varies widely by geographic location. In Asia, there are approximately 150 new cases per year.3The pathogenesis for TA remains elusive, with studies showing not only genetic predispositions but also immune-mediated mechanisms of inflammation and endothelial damage.4 Immunohistochemical studies reveal dense fibrotic tissue of all 3 layers of the vessel wall. Aneurysmal disease in TA is not uncommon, with apparent destruction of the elastic media of the involved artery.5The consensus criteria for diagnosis is still debated, but currently there are 2 major criteria used: (1) American College of Rheumatology Criteria6; and (2) Modified Ishikawa Criteria.7 Both emphasize abnormalities of the aorta and major branches, extremity claudication, and imaging abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) angiography, MRA, and digital subtraction angiography have all been used to diagnose TA. Positron emission tomography CT has also been used to visualize inflammation within the arterial wall. There are no specific laboratory markers for TA, but in the active phase, ESR, C-reactive protein, interleukin, and matrix metalloproteinase values may be elevated.3,8Glucocorticoids are the first-line treatments for TA. Twenty-percent of patients have self-limited, monophasic illness that does not need further immunomodulating agents.9 Relapse, however, can occur even during immunosuppressive therapy in 50% of patients.2 Surgical treatment is reserved for those for whom conservative treatment fails, including patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication, cardiac ischemia, hypertension due to renal artery stenosis, and aneurysmal degeneration. In general, endovascular interventions have not demonstrated long-term efficacy, and open surgical treatment remains the gold standard.10The present patient had progression of symptoms, in spite of treatment with steroids and azathioprine, leading to significant functional limitation.

Vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma,B,Vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma,"A right cervical lymph node core biopsy was CD15+, CD20−, CD30+, consistent with classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Liver biopsy revealed absent bile ducts with associated hepatocellular and canalicular cholestasis. There was no inflammation, lymphomatous infiltration, or necrosis present. Staining for CK7 showed a decreased number of small bile ducts (Figure 2). A diagnosis of vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS) secondary to stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma was made.CK7 Immunostaining highlighting bile duct damage and reduction in number of surrounding bile ducts (original magnification ×40).Hepatic involvement in Hodgkin lymphoma is common and more frequent in advanced disease.1 Etiologies of cholestasis in these patients include direct intrahepatic parenchymal involvement, extrahepatic biliary obstruction secondary to lymphadenopathy, drug toxicity, and underlying liver disease. Paraneoplastic manifestations of Hodgkin lymphoma include idiopathic cholestasis and VBDS. Ductopenia, defined as loss of interlobular bile ducts in more than 50% of portal tracts within a histologic specimen, helps distinguish between these 2 entities. An ideal biopsy sample is 3 cm long with at least 11 portal tracts (>20 is optimal).2 Immunostaining for biliary elements may improve diagnostic yield. Direct hepatic involvement from lymphoma is absent in most specimens.Vanishing bile duct syndrome was first described in 3 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma presenting with severe intrahepatic cholestasis. Liver biopsy demonstrated absent bile ducts and a characteristic “burned out appearance” of the portal tracts.3 The cause of VBDS is unclear, but biliary duct damage due to cytokine release from lymphoma cells seems likely.4 No specific biliary epithelial-associated autoantibody has been found in Hodgkin-associated VBDS.5 Our patient’s disease was positive for Epstein-Barr virus, but this has no known association with VBDS.Historically considered a poor prognostic factor, VBDS was associated with a 1-year overall survival of 43% in a series of 37 affected patients.6 Hepatic damage appeared reversible. Improved outcomes in VBDS correlate with more efficacious lymphoma therapies. Hepatic impairment at time of diagnosis often limits use of optimal cytotoxic therapy. Subtotal lymphoid irradiation (STLI) for patients with early-stage nonbulky Hodgkin lymphoma has failure-free survival rates of 81% to 93%, compared with 94% to 96% with chemotherapy alone.7 For patients with VBDS and early-stage disease, definitive therapy with STLI is a reasonable treatment option. Patients with advanced disease can receive high-dose steroids and ursodiol to facilitate administration of dose-reduced chemotherapy.8 Development of antibody-drug conjugates with improved hepatic tolerance such as brentuximab vedotin offers new options for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma–associated VBDS.Our patient initially received corticosteroids, with minimal improvement in his cholestasis. Given his advanced disease, young age, and excellent performance status, a trial of dose-reduced brentuximab vedotin (1.2 mg/kg) was administered. After 3 cycles of dose-reduced brentuximab, repeat imaging showed partial response. Cholestasis improved but the patient’s intractable pruritus persisted. He started biliary apheresis with resolution of symptoms after 15 sessions.9 He had a complete response after 6 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine and has returned to work with no sequelae of treatment 1 year after diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient receiving up-front brentuximab to achieve temporary control of VBDS prior to definitive treatment with conventional chemotherapy.",Oncology,"A Hispanic man in his 20s with no known medical history presented with worsening abdominal pain over 5 days, persistent pruritus, and scleral icterus.

Exposure to UV radiation and immunosuppression are major predisposing factors to MCC. Merkel cell polyomavirus also has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MCC.1Merkel cell carcinoma has aggressive biological behavior characterized by rapid growth, early distant metastasis, and poor prognosis. The most common metastatic sites include the skin, lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and central nervous system.2 Recurrence is common, with 90% of relapses occurring within 2 years.3 Both locoregional and distant relapses are frequent, with some unusual recurrence sites occasionally reported. The prognosis of metastatic MCC is generally poor, with an estimated median survival time of 9 months.4 Gastric metastases from MCC are extremely uncommon, with fewer than 10 cases reported in the English-language literature.5-7In previously reported cases of MCC, severe gastrointestinal bleeding was the main symptom.

A 92-gene cancer classification assay on the biopsied specimen confirmed the diagnosis and localized the primary to the pancreas with 90% probability.Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging modality for the evaluation of incidental cardiac masses seen on echocardiogram because it can determine the extent of the tumor involvement and cellular characteristics, as well as any associated complications. Cardiac tumors are generally divided into primary (benign in 75% of cases) and include rhabdomyomas; and secondary from metastatic disease (100-1000–fold more common), which should be considered first.1 In absolute numbers, carcinoma of the lung and breast account for most cardiac metastases, but the highest percentages of cardiac involvement occur with melanoma, leukemia, and lymphoma.2In examining the possibilities of multiple intramyocardial masses, rhabdomyomas are more common in children and tend to regress with age. Melanoma deposits usually invade all chambers of the myocardium and are hyperintense on T1-weighted images due to the melanin component. Lymphoma invasion of the heart is grossly discernible, unlike leukemia, and can involve epicardium, myocardium, or endocardium in a patient with lymphadenopathy elsewhere.1,2 Our patient did not have evidence of widespread disease, prompting use of the genomic profiling assay, which has been shown to correctly identify the site of origin in 95% of cases of neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown primary.3Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) encompass a heterogeneous group of tumors that arise from neuroendocrine tissue and exhibit varied clinical behavior. The incidence has been increasing, and the prevalence is even greater due to the indolent nature of the disease.4 Pancreatic NETs are foregut derivatives; they have an incidence of 1/100 000 per year and account for 1% to 2% of all pancreatic neoplasms. The majority of them are functional, but 15% can be nonfunctional and present late with symptoms of local mass effect or metastasis.4 The World Health Organization grades gastrointestinal and pancreatic NETs using the mitotic rate and Ki-67 index. A high-grade tumor is classified on the basis of a mitotic rate of greater than 20/10 per high-powered field or a Ki-67 index of greater than 20%,4 as seen in our patient.Surgery is the standard of treatment for resectable pancreatic NETs, but most patients present with advanced disease that is unresectable and warrants systemic therapy.5 Multiple agents have been used for low- to intermediate-grade tumors. Somatostatin analogs (ie, octreotide acetate and lanreotide acetate) are usually first line therapy, due to their safety profile and possible antiproliferative effects.5 Biologically targeted therapies include the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitor sunitinib malate, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus, both of which showed a significantly longer median progression-free survival compared with placebo (11.4 vs 5.5 months for sunitinib and 11.6 vs 4.6 months for everolimus).6,7 Temozolomide, an oral alkylating agent, has shown variable response rates when used in combination with other agents. The most promising combination is with capecitabine, in which 30 patients with advanced pancreatic NETs showed 70% response rate and a median progression-free survival of 18 months.8 Prospective studies are limited to phase 2 single-institution trials.5Platinum-based chemotherapy (ie, platinum and etoposide phosphate) is first-line therapy for high-grade tumors, but some evidence suggests poor response (15% vs 42%) in tumors with a moderately high proliferation rate (Ki-67 < 55%).9 Temozolomide-based therapy is now commonly used as a second-line therapy after disease progression during platinum-based therapy.9 Our patient elected not to undergo platinum-based therapy in favor of a less toxic approach.

The majority of them are functional, but 15% can be nonfunctional and present late with symptoms of local mass effect or metastasis.4 The World Health Organization grades gastrointestinal and pancreatic NETs using the mitotic rate and Ki-67 index. A high-grade tumor is classified on the basis of a mitotic rate of greater than 20/10 per high-powered field or a Ki-67 index of greater than 20%,4 as seen in our patient.Surgery is the standard of treatment for resectable pancreatic NETs, but most patients present with advanced disease that is unresectable and warrants systemic therapy.5 Multiple agents have been used for low- to intermediate-grade tumors. Somatostatin analogs (ie, octreotide acetate and lanreotide acetate) are usually first line therapy, due to their safety profile and possible antiproliferative effects.5 Biologically targeted therapies include the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitor sunitinib malate, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus, both of which showed a significantly longer median progression-free survival compared with placebo (11.4 vs 5.5 months for sunitinib and 11.6 vs 4.6 months for everolimus).6,7 Temozolomide, an oral alkylating agent, has shown variable response rates when used in combination with other agents. The most promising combination is with capecitabine, in which 30 patients with advanced pancreatic NETs showed 70% response rate and a median progression-free survival of 18 months.8 Prospective studies are limited to phase 2 single-institution trials.5Platinum-based chemotherapy (ie, platinum and etoposide phosphate) is first-line therapy for high-grade tumors, but some evidence suggests poor response (15% vs 42%) in tumors with a moderately high proliferation rate (Ki-67 < 55%).9 Temozolomide-based therapy is now commonly used as a second-line therapy after disease progression during platinum-based therapy.9 Our patient elected not to undergo platinum-based therapy in favor of a less toxic approach. She was therefore treated with octreotide long-acting release at a dose of 30 mg monthly and temozolomide at a dose of 200 mg/m2 on days 10 to 14, together with capecitabine at a dose of 750 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 14. She responded to treatment with minimal increase in cardiac tumor size for a follow-up period of 16 months, indicating less aggressive tumor characteristics.",Oncology,"A patient in them 50s presented for evaluation of intermittent epigastric pain, palpitations, and hot flashes for 2 months.

Examination revealed distant heart sounds but otherwise had unremarkable results. An echocardiogram demonstrated a mass in the left ventricular myocardium. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was obtained to further assess the mass lesion. This revealed multiple intramyocardial masses involving the left ventricle, the largest of which measured 2.7 × 2.2 cm; aortopulmonary window lymphadenopathy; and moderate pericardial effusion (Figure). Computed tomographic imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast failed to reveal discrete masses or lymphadenopathy elsewhere.

Hypophysitis,C,Hypophysitis,"Brain MRI revealed an enlarged, heterogeneously enhancing pituitary gland (Figure, arrowhead), with a thickened infundibular stalk and normal optic chiasm. Based on these clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings, the patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis (IH).Ipilimumab unleashes antitumor T-cell responses by blocking the CTLA-4 inhibitory molecule. However, the resultant T-cell activation may trigger immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). These include colitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, neuropathies, or endocrinopathies, such as hypophysitis.1,2The incidence of IH in patients with metastatic melanoma was approximately 1.5% in a large phase 3 study evaluating ipilimumab 3 mg/kg.1 Potential risk factors include male sex3,4 and older age.3 Newer anti–programmed death-1 (anti–PD-1) immune therapies induce hypophysitis in less than 1%, but in roughly 10% of patients treated with combination ipilimumab–anti–PD-1.5The clinical presentation of IH may include symptoms of mass effect (headache), compression of the optic chiasm (visual field defects), and glucocorticoid deficiency (easy fatigability, weakness, anorexia).6 Symptoms of IH usually develop 6 to 12 weeks after initiation of ipilimumab therapy.6 A high index of clinical suspicion is needed to prompt laboratory evaluation and therapeutic intervention. This condition can be life threatening in patients with profound adrenal insufficiency.6,7Pituitary assessment through hormone measurements and MRI establish the diagnosis. Initial MRI findings often include diffuse pituitary enlargement and homogeneous or heterogeneous pituitary enhancement with or without suprasellar extension.8 However, an unremarkable MRI does not rule out IH and does not preclude laboratory evaluation.9 Patients should be routinely and carefully monitored for IRAEs during treatment and follow-up. This should include laboratory and clinical assessment for hypophysitis. At least thyrotropin should be evaluated at every treatment, with a low threshold to check cortisol levels. Particular vigilance should be maintained after the third treatment dose.Ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis predominantly involves the anterior pituitary, notably the thyroid, adrenocortical, and gonadal axes. Preclinical models have recently identified CTLA-4 expression in thyrotropin-secreting cells in the anterior pituitary.2 This study also suggested that ipilimumab binds these cells and triggers the complement cascade and immune activation. Posterior pituitary dysfunction (diabetes insipidus) rarely develops.7Treatment for IH involves hormone replacement and possibly high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Close follow-up is needed to assess for resolution of hormonal deficiencies. Thyroid and gonadal function often normalizes, but cortisol deficiency may persist for years, and requires prolonged low-dose corticosteroid replacement (hydrocortisone 20 mg every morning and 10 mg every evening, or prednisone 5 mg daily).9High-dose corticosteroids are a staple for clinically significant IRAEs. Their use in hypophysitis, however, is controversial. Compared with physiologic glucocorticoid replacement doses, high-dose steroids do not seem to improve clinical outcomes as measured by speed or frequency of resolution.4 Common high-dose steroid regimens, if used, include methylprednisolone or prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/d for 1 week, tapered over approximately 4 weeks.7 Recent studies have suggested that corticosteroids do not compromise the activity of ipilimumab.7 Interestingly, hypophysitis may predict improved survival following ipilimumab therapy. A small, 17-patient cohort with IH had an improved median survival compared with unselected patients (19.4 vs 8.8 months).3 In addition, patients may safely continue ipilimumab therapy following IH and may be considered for anti–PD-1 therapy if subsequent therapy is needed.This patient had classic clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings.

Anal adenocarcinoma,C,Anal adenocarcinoma,"Histopathological analysis revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (Figure 2). A few days later, clinical signs of intestinal obstruction appeared and abdominoperineal resection of the rectum was performed to remove the mass in toto. To improve survival, the patient received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Eighteen months after resection, there has been no recurrence of disease.Microscopic findings of the anal adenocarcinoma (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×40).Carcinomas of the anal canal are rare malignant neoplasms composing approximately 1% to 2% of all gastrointestinal carcinomas. The most frequent tumor of the anal canal is squamous cell carcinoma. It accounts for 97% of cases. Other less common neoplasms such as basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and neuroendocrine tumors account for the remaining 3% of cases.1-3Carcinomas of the anal canal have nonspecific clinical presentation. They often mimic more common benign conditions like hemorrhoids, fissures, perianal abscess, anal fistula, or pilonidal sinus. Early differentiation of these benign conditions from cancer is crucial for favorable outcomes in many patients. In our case, the patient misunderstood the symptoms of cancer as signs of hemorrhoids and therefore delayed appropriate treatment. His reluctance to see a physician led to an increase in tumor size to dimensions that are rarely seen.Diagnostic criteria and the standard treatment for adenocarcinoma and other carcinomas of the anal canal have not been clearly defined, in part because of the rarity of these lesions. Accurate histological diagnosis is vital to determine treatment and surgical management as survival patterns can differ among anal neoplasms. While reports suggest that for patients with squamous cell carcinoma chemoradiation offers survival and recurrence rates equivalent to surgery, adenocarcinoma is managed primarily by surgery.4,5 Abdominoperineal resection in combination with neoadjuvant chemoradiation is recommended rather than local resection for T2 and higher grades of adenocarcinoma.6,7 Other rare tumors of the anal canal respond poorly to chemoradiation, and surgery is the mainstay of their treatment.8 Reported disease-free 5-year survival varies from 21% to 58% according to the type and differentiation of the tumor.9In conclusion, carcinoma of the anal canal is so unusual that few physicians will be exposed to these lesions during their practice. Because benign lesions are much more common, it is important not to misinterpret malignant lesions as benign. As in our case, it usually results in delayed diagnosis and treatment. Because delay is associated with higher mortality, it is necessary to make an early diagnosis using detailed examination and biopsy if a lesion is suspect.",Surgery,"A 65-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a painful anal mass and fecal incontinence.

3618,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2396581,"A man in his 70s presented with blurred vision in his left eye. The patient had a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia with excess blasts–2), prostate cancer treated with prostatectomy and radiation therapy 5 years prior, and colonic adenocarcinoma treated with right hemicolectomy 6 years prior. Four months before presentation, his myelodysplastic syndrome transformed into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He was randomized to experimental drug CPX-351 for induction, but treatment was discontinued as a result of renal failure. However, remission was successfully induced with mitoxantrone hydrochloride and etoposide therapy, as confirmed by bone marrow biopsy, and he was prescribed continuing melphalan therapy on an outpatient basis.Three days prior to presentation, the patient on awakening noticed an acute onset of blurred vision in his left eye without any pain, photophobia, diplopia, vision loss, or floaters. He had no history of ocular surgery or trauma. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left. External examination had unremarkable results. Pupillary and motility assessments had normal results. Intraocular pressure was elevated bilaterally, measuring 29 mm Hg in the right eye and 41 mm Hg in the left.Slitlamp examination of the right eye revealed a 0.5-mm hypopyon with small hemorrhages on the iris surface (Figure 1A). In the left eye, examination demonstrated a 1.5-mm hypopyon mixed with hemorrhage, 1+ cells in the anterior chamber, and small hemorrhages on the iris surface (Figure 1B). Bilaterally, gonioscopy revealed open angles with few hemorrhages in the angle but no neovascularization. Dilated fundoscopic examination had unremarkable results bilaterally, with no retinal hemorrhages or optic disc swelling.Color slitlamp photographs illustrating bilateral hypopyon (black arrowheads) with iris surface hemorrhages (white arrowheads).

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Endogenous endophthalmitis,HLA-B27 uveitis,Herpes simplex uveitis,Leukemia relapse,D. Leukemia relapse,D,Leukemia relapse,"Anterior chamber paracentesis was performed in the left eye, with cytologic analysis revealing myeloblasts in the aqueous humor, indicating a pseudohypopyon in the setting of AML relapse (Figure 2). Peripheral blood smear also demonstrated blast cells.Cytological evaluation of anterior chamber aqueous humor aspirate demonstrating myeloblasts (white arrowheads) (Wright stain, original magnification ×500).Pseudohypopyon is the accumulation of malignant cells in the anterior chamber, which differs from hypopyon, the infiltration of leukocytes due to infection or inflammation. Hypopyon is often seen in endogenous endophthalmitis, an intraocular infection seeded from blood-borne infections, and immunocompromised patients are especially susceptible.1Candida is the most common pathogen.2 Systemic evaluation is warranted, including blood, urine, and vitreous and aqueous humor cultures.1 HLA-B27 uveitis is a major cause of acute anterior uveitis, which can include the development of a unilateral or bilateral hypopyon.1 HLA-B27 is a class I major histocompatibility complex molecule associated with inflammatory rheumatic and gastrointestinal disorders. A carefully elicited history can identify associated systemic diseases, and tests for HLA-B27 can help diagnose HLA-B27 uveitis. Herpes simplex virus is widespread and can be found in almost all cadavers of persons 60 years or older at death.3 Although ocular involvement is a well-known complication of herpes simplex virus infection, hypopyon is rare.1,3Pseudohypopyon can present in a variety of leukemias, although the highest incidence (up to 18%) is associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.1 In a 1989 prospective 2-year study of ocular findings of 53 patients undergoing AML treatment, none developed pseudohypopyon,4 illustrating the rarity of this presentation at that time. Since then, there have been multiple cases documenting the pseudohypopyon in AML.5-7 Increased reports of pseudohypopyon in AML should prompt evolving clinical approaches.This unusual manifestation of AML relapse portends a grave prognosis. Among 15 patients, 13 died within months after presentation of the pseudohypopyon.5-7 At time of presentation, all 15 had already developed diffuse systemic disease, but not all involved the central nervous system. In our patient, no evidence of leukemia was detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging and he declined a lumbar puncture. Evaluation of cases with diffuse disease accompanying pseudohypopyon revealed that 9 of 14 patients received a diagnosis of either M4 or M5 AML.6 In the 1 case of long-term survival after presentation of the pseudohypopyon, the patient showed no other evidence of extramedullary leukemic infiltration outside the eye.5 This uncommonly successful outcome impresses the importance of prompt identification of AML relapse. The immune-privileged microenvironment, coupled with low penetration of chemotherapeutics, may allow the anterior chamber to shelter malignant seeds, leaving it susceptible to relapse.8 Thus, noninvasive eye examinations can be leveraged to monitor for signs of relapse.Treatment is varied but can include systemic chemotherapy and localized radiotherapy.9 Our patient opted to discontinue treatment and entered hospice care.In summary, for patients with a history of AML presenting with ocular and visual changes, a high index of suspicion must be maintained for relapse of leukemia.

Hypopyon is often seen in endogenous endophthalmitis, an intraocular infection seeded from blood-borne infections, and immunocompromised patients are especially susceptible.1Candida is the most common pathogen.2 Systemic evaluation is warranted, including blood, urine, and vitreous and aqueous humor cultures.1 HLA-B27 uveitis is a major cause of acute anterior uveitis, which can include the development of a unilateral or bilateral hypopyon.1 HLA-B27 is a class I major histocompatibility complex molecule associated with inflammatory rheumatic and gastrointestinal disorders. A carefully elicited history can identify associated systemic diseases, and tests for HLA-B27 can help diagnose HLA-B27 uveitis. Herpes simplex virus is widespread and can be found in almost all cadavers of persons 60 years or older at death.3 Although ocular involvement is a well-known complication of herpes simplex virus infection, hypopyon is rare.1,3Pseudohypopyon can present in a variety of leukemias, although the highest incidence (up to 18%) is associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.1 In a 1989 prospective 2-year study of ocular findings of 53 patients undergoing AML treatment, none developed pseudohypopyon,4 illustrating the rarity of this presentation at that time. Since then, there have been multiple cases documenting the pseudohypopyon in AML.5-7 Increased reports of pseudohypopyon in AML should prompt evolving clinical approaches.This unusual manifestation of AML relapse portends a grave prognosis. Among 15 patients, 13 died within months after presentation of the pseudohypopyon.5-7 At time of presentation, all 15 had already developed diffuse systemic disease, but not all involved the central nervous system. In our patient, no evidence of leukemia was detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging and he declined a lumbar puncture. Evaluation of cases with diffuse disease accompanying pseudohypopyon revealed that 9 of 14 patients received a diagnosis of either M4 or M5 AML.6 In the 1 case of long-term survival after presentation of the pseudohypopyon, the patient showed no other evidence of extramedullary leukemic infiltration outside the eye.5 This uncommonly successful outcome impresses the importance of prompt identification of AML relapse. The immune-privileged microenvironment, coupled with low penetration of chemotherapeutics, may allow the anterior chamber to shelter malignant seeds, leaving it susceptible to relapse.8 Thus, noninvasive eye examinations can be leveraged to monitor for signs of relapse.Treatment is varied but can include systemic chemotherapy and localized radiotherapy.9 Our patient opted to discontinue treatment and entered hospice care.In summary, for patients with a history of AML presenting with ocular and visual changes, a high index of suspicion must be maintained for relapse of leukemia.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Plantar warts,Shingles,Cutaneous lymphoma,Toxic erythema of chemotherapy,B. Shingles,B,Shingles,"Direct fluorescence antigen testing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed on skin scrapings and confirmed the diagnosis of herpes zoster (shingles) in an unusual S2 dermatomal distribution. While the brown, flat-topped papules on the plantar aspect of the foot resemble warts, they lacked the characteristic dot-like structures and verrucous appearance. The patient’s scheduled chemotherapy for that day was cancelled, and he was started on valacyclovir, 1 g 3 times daily. Rapid clinical diagnosis is critical when patients are receiving chemotherapy, especially with cytopenia, to minimize the risk of disseminated infection. Chemotherapy was resumed 2 weeks later when he had recovered from the herpes zoster and all lesions had crusted over.A history of primary varicella zoster infection is nearly universal in adult populations of North America and results in the diffuse vesicular rash of varicella (chicken pox).1 Following primary infection, the varicella zoster virus (VZV) establishes latency within sensory dorsal root ganglia; reactivation manifests as herpes zoster and is typically heralded by a painful, unilateral vesicular eruption in a dermatomal distribution. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates, 32% of Americans will experience herpes zoster during their lifetimes.2 The incidence of herpes zoster is higher in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with lymphoproliferative malignant neoplasms.3 In 13% to 50% of patients with lymphoma, herpes zoster may present with life-threatening, disseminated disease involving multiple, nonadjacent dermatomes as well as visceral sites.3 Disseminated disease is associated with a 6% to 17% mortality rate.4 In patients with cancer, an elevated risk of localized or disseminated VZV infection exists in patients specifically with Hodgkin disease, lymphoproliferative malignant lesions, lung cancer, and among those who received bone marrow transplantation.4The incidence of herpes zoster infection is significantly higher in patients with lymphoma compared with those with nonhematologic solid tumors, and risk factors include advanced stage and recent radiation therapy.5 A retrospective cohort study of adult patients with cancer noted the incidence of herpes zoster to be 31 per 1000 person-years for patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms and 12 per 1000 person-years in those with solid tumors. Patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms were twice as likely to develop herpes zoster as those with solid tumors and 5 times more likely than the general population.1Zostavax is a live, attenuated zoster vaccine, and administration may result in disseminated disease in the immunosuppressed. It is therefore contraindicated in patients with primary or acquired immunodeficiency states, including leukemia, lymphoma, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system.6 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices states that patients with leukemia in remission may receive the zoster vaccine as long as no chemotherapy or radiation was given in the past 3 months.6 Tseng et al7 suggested that the zoster vaccine affords effective protection when given to adults 60 years or older who subsequently were diagnosed as having cancer and had received chemotherapy.In summary, herpes zoster in the lumbar and sacral dermatomes can present with lesions in seemingly unrelated distribution (lateral thigh and plantar foot) and has multiple clinical presentations (wartlike and rashlike). Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for herpes zoster in patients with cancer, especially those receiving chemotherapy. The quality of the pain out of proportion to the examination is often an indicator of herpes zoster infection. Treatment should be started empirically. Direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) testing on scrapings from active vesicular lesions is a rapid method for the detection of the virus and has a sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 94%, respectively. A VZV-specific PCR is often used in the instance where the results from DFA testing is negative but clinical suspicion for herpes zoster remains high. Sensitivity and specificity are both higher for PCR testing (97.6 and 100%, respectively).8",Oncology,"A 50-year-old man with transformed marginal zone lymphoma presented with intensely painful lesions on his left foot for 2 days.

Chemotherapy was resumed 2 weeks later when he had recovered from the herpes zoster and all lesions had crusted over.A history of primary varicella zoster infection is nearly universal in adult populations of North America and results in the diffuse vesicular rash of varicella (chicken pox).1 Following primary infection, the varicella zoster virus (VZV) establishes latency within sensory dorsal root ganglia; reactivation manifests as herpes zoster and is typically heralded by a painful, unilateral vesicular eruption in a dermatomal distribution. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates, 32% of Americans will experience herpes zoster during their lifetimes.2 The incidence of herpes zoster is higher in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with lymphoproliferative malignant neoplasms.3 In 13% to 50% of patients with lymphoma, herpes zoster may present with life-threatening, disseminated disease involving multiple, nonadjacent dermatomes as well as visceral sites.3 Disseminated disease is associated with a 6% to 17% mortality rate.4 In patients with cancer, an elevated risk of localized or disseminated VZV infection exists in patients specifically with Hodgkin disease, lymphoproliferative malignant lesions, lung cancer, and among those who received bone marrow transplantation.4The incidence of herpes zoster infection is significantly higher in patients with lymphoma compared with those with nonhematologic solid tumors, and risk factors include advanced stage and recent radiation therapy.5 A retrospective cohort study of adult patients with cancer noted the incidence of herpes zoster to be 31 per 1000 person-years for patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms and 12 per 1000 person-years in those with solid tumors. Patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms were twice as likely to develop herpes zoster as those with solid tumors and 5 times more likely than the general population.1Zostavax is a live, attenuated zoster vaccine, and administration may result in disseminated disease in the immunosuppressed. It is therefore contraindicated in patients with primary or acquired immunodeficiency states, including leukemia, lymphoma, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system.6 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices states that patients with leukemia in remission may receive the zoster vaccine as long as no chemotherapy or radiation was given in the past 3 months.6 Tseng et al7 suggested that the zoster vaccine affords effective protection when given to adults 60 years or older who subsequently were diagnosed as having cancer and had received chemotherapy.In summary, herpes zoster in the lumbar and sacral dermatomes can present with lesions in seemingly unrelated distribution (lateral thigh and plantar foot) and has multiple clinical presentations (wartlike and rashlike). Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for herpes zoster in patients with cancer, especially those receiving chemotherapy. The quality of the pain out of proportion to the examination is often an indicator of herpes zoster infection. Treatment should be started empirically. Direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) testing on scrapings from active vesicular lesions is a rapid method for the detection of the virus and has a sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 94%, respectively. A VZV-specific PCR is often used in the instance where the results from DFA testing is negative but clinical suspicion for herpes zoster remains high. Sensitivity and specificity are both higher for PCR testing (97.6 and 100%, respectively).8",Oncology,"A 50-year-old patient with transformed marginal zone lymphoma presented with intensely painful lesions on their left foot for 2 days. They noted a childhood history of plantar warts and believed these lesions to be identical in appearance. They did not recall any injury or unusual exposure. They had received their third cycle of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, prednisone) 2 weeks prior to presentation as well as an injection of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. They was anticipating their fourth cycle of treatment the day of their presentation. They also complained of a pruritic rash on their left thigh that had started several days before the appearance of their plantar foot lesions. The patient was afebrile, and their vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination revealed grouped, brown, flat-topped papules on their distal plantar left foot (Figure). It was exquisitely tender to palpation, and the patient was visibly uncomfortable when walking. They also demonstrated erythematous papules and plaques on their posterolateral thigh. A few areas had shallow erosions. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia, with a white blood cell count of 2800/μL, hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, and a platelet count of 81 × 103/μL.

Approximately 65% are associated with structures of the head or neck, of which 86% are supratentorial and 24% infratentorial.1 Males and females are affected in equal parts. Hemangiomas may occur in a sporadic or familial fashion, related to mutations in CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3.2,3Despite being mostly asymptomatic, hemangiomas can be associated with a multitude of symptoms, ranging from headaches and seizures to severe focal neurologic deficits and hemorrhage.4On gross examination, cavernous hemangiomas appear as soft, purple, poorly defined, and discolored lesions that blanch on compression. Pathologic examination reveals thin-walled, dilated capillaries surrounded by a single layer of endothelium.1 Magnetic resonance imaging remains the diagnostic imaging of choice. Other imaging modalities, including radiography, computed tomography, and tagged red blood cell scans, are commonly used for additional characterization.1,5Treatment of cavernous hemangiomas is based on their location and symptoms and may include medical or surgical interventions. Asymptomatic lesions are observed and monitored with interval imaging studies. Sclerosing agents and corticosteroids have been used to shrink tumors and prevent scaring. Lesions that cause compressive symptoms, hemorrhage, seizures, or neurologic deficits require prompt intervention. Surgical planning must consider the risks and benefits of the procedure, especially for lesions deep in the central nervous system. Predictors of good surgical outcome included mesiotemporal location, small size, and absence of long and poorly controlled preoperative seizure history.6",Surgery,"A patient in them mid-50s presented to the clinic with a 6-month history of progressive swelling and pain on the right side of them neck.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm,C,Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm,"Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are precancerous lesions that are anatomically classified as main-duct type (MD-IPMN), branch-duct type (BD-IPMN), or mixed type, based on their involvement with the main pancreatic duct.1 The clinical significance of this designation is the risk of malignant neoplasms in more than 60% of MD-IPMN cases2 compared with less than 25% of cases of BD-IPMN.2,3 Accordingly, the distinction between MD-IPMN and BD-IPMN is critical in evaluating patients with a new diagnosis of IPMN to dictate adequate operative management.Using findings from the patient’s computed tomographic scan, a diagnosis of MD-IPMN was made based on the radiographic findings of diffuse dilation of the main pancreatic duct and the heterogeneous soft-tissue density nodules noted in the duct at the level of the pancreatic body and neck (Figure 1A). These radiographic findings are pathognomonic for IPMN and are indicative of a malignant neoplasm.4 In our patient’s case, they signified the presence of invasive adenocarcinoma.According to the international consensus guidelines for the management of IPMN, all MD-IPMN lesions should be completely resected with negative margins in patients who are good surgical candidates.2 Our patient underwent a total pancreatectomy and splenectomy given the diffuse nature of his disease. A heterogeneous 7.0 × 3.5 × 3.4-cm pancreatic head mass was removed that involved the whole body and tail of the pancreas, with multiple papillary projections in the lumen (Figure 2). Involvement of the ampulla of Vater was noted and a polypoid pedunculated tumor (3.2 × 2.7 × 2.0 cm) was found adjacent to the papilla (Figure 2). The final pathologic feature was reported as invasive adenocarcinoma arising from a pancreatobiliary-type IPMN. Of the 4 histologic subtypes for IPMN, the type with pancreatobiliary histologic features has been reported to have the poorest prognosis, with an associated 5-year survival of 35.6%, while the intestinal, oncocytic, and gastric intestinal subtypes have rates of 86.8%, 75.0%, and 70.0%, respectively.5Gross pathologic image of resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.

Her right eye had been enucleated 40 years before for choroidal melanoma, and she had been fitted with an ocular prosthesis (Figure 1). Twenty-six years before presentation, she had received a diagnosis of moderately differentiated, estrogen and progesterone receptor–positive, invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast (stage II, T2N1M0). At that time, she underwent modified radical mastectomy, and 3 lymph nodes were positive for carcinoma. She was then treated with 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and fluorouracil, followed by daily tamoxifen citrate for nearly 5 years. There was no evidence of recurrent disease after this treatment. External examination revealed mild edema, erythema, and ptosis of the left upper lid (Figure 1).

The patient had a history of breast cancer and choroidal melanoma. Because metastatic cancer is the most common ocular malignant neoplasm in adults, a complete examination by an ophthalmologist, including orbital computed tomography (CT), is the recommended initial step.She was referred to an ophthalmologist, who found a palpable, nontender, nodular mass near the superolateral orbital rim. Funduscopic examination was unremarkable. No blepharitis was present. Orbital CT revealed left lacrimal gland enlargement. Left lacrimal gland and subbrow tissue biopsy revealed discohesive tumor cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios in an infiltrating pattern. These cells were immunoreactive for estrogen (Figure 2) and progesterone receptors and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu. The diagnosis was consistent with metastasis of poorly differentiated breast carcinoma to the lacrimal gland.Immunostains demonstrated estrogen-positive tumor cells (black arrowhead), often in single file, invading lacrimal (white arrowhead) and orbital tissue, indicating metastasis of breast carcinoma (original magnification ×400).The differential diagnosis includes infectious preseptal cellulitis and inflammatory conditions such as blepharitis and sarcoidosis, as well as primary and metastatic tumors. The nonneoplastic etiologies were unlikely, given the absence of pain, infection, trauma, and meibomian gland dysfunction.1 Sarcoidosis, lymphoid disorders, lacrimal tumors, and metastatic lesions should also be considered.2,3 A histopathological diagnosis is often the most helpful in establishing the diagnosis, especially to distinguish neoplastic from inflammatory causes.Breast cancer is the most common type of orbital metastases, accounting for 29% in a recent series, followed by melanoma (20%). One center noted that of 300 patients with metastatic breast cancer, only 2 patients received a diagnosis of orbital metastases (0.67%).4  Eighty-nine percent of patients with breast cancer metastases to the orbit had a previous diagnosis of breast cancer.5 Metastases of choroidal melanoma to the contralateral orbit remain rare. The duration from diagnosis of primary breast cancer to orbital metastases ranges from 4.5 to 6.5 years.5 Most breast cancer metastases occur in the extraocular muscles, orbital fat, and bone (91%), and thus patients can present with double vision, decreased vision, and pain.5,6 Breast cancer metastatic to the orbit can also present with an unusual feature not characteristic of other types of orbital metastases: enophthalmos, which can be seen in 10% of cases.5 Orbital breast metastases can be treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapies.6 Breast cancer metastatic to the lacrimal gland is rare: to our knowledge this report is only the third case, and the first with histopathological findings described.6,7Systemic investigation revealed evidence for distant metastases. Serologic workup showed elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (9 ng/mL; reference range, <2.5 ng/mL) and cancer antigen 15-3 (112.5 U/mL; reference range, <30 U/mL), and circulating tumor cells (>5 per 7.5 mL of blood). A right breast biopsy showed lobular carcinoma in situ. A PET scan revealed abnormal uptake in multiple posterolateral ribs and the thoracic spine, indicating bony metastases. The patient began receiving anastrozole daily with intravenous bisphosphonate but was switched to denosumab therapy because of acute renal failure. Over the next 9 months, she experienced worsening fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and decreased appetite. She began 3 biweekly injections of fulvestrant. On follow-up, nodular hepatomegaly was noted, liver enzyme levels were elevated, and CT showed diffuse liver metastases.

The diverticulum was torsed at its base, causing obstruction, dilation, and ischemia (Figure 2). A segmental bowel resection with primary anastomosis and an appendectomy were performed. The child was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 4 and had returned to normal activity by his 1-month follow-up appointment.Surgical specimen featuring a torsed and ischemic Meckel diverticulum that contains enteroliths.Meckel diverticulum is the most common congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract, occurring in 2% of the population.1 It is a true diverticulum that forms on the antimesenteric border of the distal ileum after incomplete involution of the omphalomesenteric duct between the fifth and ninth weeks of gestation. An estimated 55% of Meckel diverticula contain heterotopic tissue, most commonly gastric (52%-68.3%) and pancreatic (5%-8.5%) tissue.2,3Most Meckel diverticula (84%) are asymptomatic in children and adults, and the frequency of symptomatic diverticula decreases with age.2 Symptomatic Meckel diverticula in children are more common in males than females (3:1 ratio).2 The most common symptomatic presentations in children are painless rectal bleeding or intestinal obstruction, often due to intussusception with the diverticulum acting as the lead point.2-4 Bleeding Meckel diverticula are typically associated with heterotopic gastric tissue. Other clinical presentations of symptomatic Meckel diverticula include perforation, diverticulitis, and umbilical discharge due to a patent omphalomesenteric duct.3,4Enterolith formation within a Meckel diverticulum is uncommon (0.3%-9.5%).5,6 When present, enteroliths are characteristically triangular and flat with a radiolucent core.7 Meckel diverticula with narrow necks may be more susceptible to enterolithiasis due to reduced efflux of diverticular contents and chronic stasis.6 Moreover, Meckel diverticula without gastric mucosa contain a relatively alkaline milieu, promoting calcium salt precipitation and enterolith formation.6 Meckel enteroliths have been found in adults presenting with diverticulitis, perforation, and small-bowel obstruction from enterolith extrusion with distal luminal impaction. A Meckel diverticulum that contains enteroliths has rarely been confused for a mature pelvic teratoma that contains teeth in an adult.8 Symptomatic Meckel enterolithiasis is rare in children, with only 2 reported cases, to our knowledge, in the literature.9,10 Although management of asymptomatic Meckel diverticulum is controversial, symptomatic diverticula require resection.",Surgery,"A 5-year-old boy with a 1-year history of intermittent abdominal pain presented to the emergency department with 2 days of nausea, nonbilious emesis, and diffuse abdominal pain.

The patient had a history of multiple episodes of hematemesis attributed to alcoholic gastritis; however, at this admission, he indicated he had not experienced vomiting. He admitted to early satiety over the past few months. Physical examination revealed a soft nondistended abdomen, but it was very tender in the epigastric region without rebound or guarding. There was no palpable mass. Elevated results of liver function tests, as well as amylase and lipase levels consistent with alcoholic pancreatitis, were noted.

Gastric duplication,C,Gastric duplication,"Initial abdominal and pelvic computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated a large (9.8 × 7.4 × 7.6-cm) heterogeneous mass located in the fundus and body of the stomach with areas of enhancement, suspicious for a possible gastrointestinal stromal tumor. On upper endoscopy, the mass occupied the upper half of the stomach, including the gastroesophageal junction, but did not extend proximally into the esophagus. Specimens obtained during progressively deeper biopsies on 2 successive occasions revealed no pathologic diagnosis.Preoperatively, endoscopic ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration biopsy was considered.1,2 Social issues prevented the patient from undergoing this test. The mass was surgically resected for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged home on hospital day 8. Final pathology examination revealed this lesion to be composed of stomach duplication tissue, confirming a diagnosis of gastric duplication cyst (Figure 2).Gross pathologic examination of the specimen demonstrates a noncommunicating gastric duplication cyst. The inset demonstrates gastric mucosal lining on either side of the gastric duplication wall (hematoxylin-eosin; original magnification ×20).Gastrointestinal duplication cysts are a rare congenital anomaly, accounting for approximately 4% of all intestinal duplications. 3,4 In 1959, Rowling5 proposed 3 morphologic criteria for the correct diagnosis of gastric duplication cysts: first, the cyst must be contiguous with the stomach wall; second, the cyst must be surrounded by at least 1 coat of smooth muscle, fusing with muscularis propria of the stomach; and third, the cyst must be lined with typical gastric mucosa. Figure 2 depicts normal gastric mucosa, a common muscularis, and attenuated gastric mucosa of the duplication on the right. The clinical presentation generally includes bowel obstruction or gastrointestinal bleeding early in life; torsion, hemorrhage, pancreatitis, and fistula formation may also occur.3,5-8 Rarely does gastric duplication present in adulthood.9 Malignant transformation has been identified in patients with gastric duplication; thus, complete resection is recommended at the time of diagnosis.10There was an associated small, noncommunicating esophageal duplication as noted. Findings at surgery included a large proximal gastric mass fibrotically adherent to the diaphragm in a desmoplastic and presumed neoplastic fashion. Total gastrectomy with removal of adherent diaphragm was undertaken with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy. We believe the chronic, unopposed acid production within the excluded gastric remnant led to full-thickness ulceration, perforation, and adherence of the stomach to the diaphragm and retroperitoneum.",Surgery,"A patient in their mid-20s with a history of alcohol abuse presented with abdominal pain after 3 days of drinking.

Primary central nervous system lymphoma,D,Primary central nervous system lymphoma,"Following imaging, the patient underwent stereotactic brain biopsy, which revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Further workup revealed no other sites of disease, and Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) was diagnosed.Contrast-enhanced MRI is the preferred imaging technique for evaluating PCNSL because it is useful for staging and biopsy planning (ability to identify spinal and/or leptomeningeal involvement). Histologically, PCNSL demonstrates dense cellular lesions that have the classic appearance of isodense to hyperdense areas on computed tomography scans and isointense to hypointense regions on T1-weighted MRI scans, which are hyperintense to white matter on T2-weighted MRI images. Unlike metastatic lesions, which often have a distinct border with contiguous brain parenchyma, PCNSL often demonstrates an infiltrative pattern within brain parenchyma. These lesions typically exhibit intense, homogeneous enhancement after contrast administration. In a study that looked at MRI features in 100 patients with PCNSL,1 only 1 patient had lesions that did not have strong or moderately strong contrast enhancement. Ring enhancement of the lesions can be seen in cases of PCNSL in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but such enhancement is considered a rare finding in immunocompetent patients.2In the same study,1 90 of a subpopulation of 96 patients with PCNSL had significant edema on MRI imaging. Along with contrast enhancement, surrounding edema is another classic finding with PCNSL, which often results in local mass effect.In immunocompetent patients, PCNSL most frequently presents as a single lesion. In some cases, however, it can present as multiple lesions, which is a typical imaging finding in patients with HIV lymphoma. In the review of 100 patients with PCNSL,1 it was found that 65% of patients presented with only 1 lesion.Most frequently involving the cerebral hemispheres, PCNSL can also involve all areas of the craniospinal axis, including brain parenchyma, leptomeninges, spinal cord, and eyes. Within the brain itself, PCNSL can involve the cortex, deep structures such as basal ganglia, corpus callosum, and periventricular regions.3 Of 100 patients with PCNSL,1 cerebral hemispheric involvement was present in 38% (most commonly in the frontal lobes). The basal ganglia were involved in 16% of cases, corpus callosum in 14%, and periventricular regions in 14%. Leptomeningeal and cerebellar involvement was found to be the least likely location.1Primary central nervous system lymphoma can also present with ocular involvement, estimated to be present in 10% to 20% of patients with PCNSL. Such ocular involvement often presents as uveitis or optic nerve infiltration on imaging.4Histologic verification of PCNSL with biopsy is necessary prior to initiation of treatment. Many patients with PCNSL who are symptomatic at presentation have lesions of considerable size with associated edema and mass effect and are consequently treated with corticosteroids to relieve the associated symptoms. The corticosteroids can rapidly “melt away” lymphomatous tumors, making stereotactic biopsy and resection difficult. Suspicion of PCNSL from imaging is crucial in the workup of these central nervous system lesions so that clinicians can refrain from prescribing corticosteroids prior to biopsy. An imaging-based suggestion of a diagnosis of PCNSL may allow for a diagnostic biopsy to be completed prior to initiation of corticosteroid administration. Quick implementation of treatment regimens can improve prognosis and quality of life for these patients.Our case highlights the notion that the characteristic features of PCNSL may be changing.

Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst,D,Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst,"The differential diagnosis for acute urinary retention, lower extremity hyperreflexia, and intermittent sensory or motor deficits dependent on activity and position includes spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, anterior thoracolumbar spinal cord herniation, and symptomatic thoracic arachnoid cysts. Our initial concern that it was a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula led us to perform magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine using FIESTA sequences in hopes of visualizing dilated serpentine spinal veins that may be seen in this entity. The findings were not consistent with a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula but rather demonstrated a flattened spinal cord with edema at the T7-T8 vertebral level (Figure), which is thought to be most compatible with anterior spinal cord herniation or a symptomatic arachnoid cyst. A subsequent computed tomographic myelogram confirmed the presence of a 14.0 × 8.4-mm posterior extradural arachnoid cyst obstructing the free flow of the contrast agent and causing intermittent deformity of the spinal cord at the T7 level with cerebrospinal fluid pulsation (Video).Spinal arachnoid cysts are uncommon protrusions of the spinal cord that rarely cause symptomatic compression of the cord. Although their pathogenesis is poorly understood, they are thought to arise from congenital deformities or dural trauma.1-3 Although magnetic resonance imaging is useful for identifying a soft tissue mass, computed tomographic myelography is the diagnostic study of choice for spinal dural arachnoid cysts because it can reveal a cyst’s access to the subarachnoid space.2,4-6 Furthermore, the dynamic nature of computed tomographic myelography enables real-time visualization of cerebrospinal fluid pulsations accounting for intermittent cord compression by the cyst and the resultant episodic symptoms. The origin of these pulsations has been suggested to be primarily related to the cardia, arising from intracranial pulsations in the cerebrovascular bed and choroid plexus, along with local pulsations in the spinovascular beds.7,8 Respiration has also been shown to variably influence the magnitude and duration of cerebrospinal fluid pulsations.9The definitive treatment of spinal arachnoid cysts is complete surgical excision of the cyst with repair of the communicating dural defect.2 The prognosis is favorable, often with complete resolution of neurological symptoms following operative resection. Those presenting with a shorter duration of symptoms tend to have better outcomes than those with a more prolonged duration.10 Urinary retention may be reversible or irreversible depending on the duration and extent of cord compression.The patient underwent T7-T8 laminectomy with resection of the cyst and experienced immediate resolution of sensory symptoms.

The rash initially started 4 years prior as a dime-sized, pink, scaly area in the right inguinal crease and was pruritic. Results of a biopsy at the time were consistent with lichen simplex chronicus, and treatment with topical steroids was initiated. Since then, the rash had failed to resolve and the affected area had increased in size to its present dimensions.

Examination revealed a multifocal scaly, pink-red beefy plaque in the right inguinal crease extending from the superior aspect of the scrotum to the gluteal crease measuring approximately 6 × 7 cm in total area with some areas of excoriation and superficial open wounds. An additional area of macular erythema extended superiorly along the inguinal crease toward the medial thigh. No lymphadenopathy of the inguinal region was noted. What Is Your Diagnosis?",Fungal infection,Extramammary Paget disease,Bowen disease,Lichen sclerosis,B. Extramammary Paget disease,B,Extramammary Paget disease,"Repeated biopsy revealed epidermal infiltration by Paget cells, which are large vacuolated cells with vesicular nuclei and foamy pale cytoplasm (Figure 2).1 Immunohistochemical stains were positive for cytokeratin 7 and carcinoembryonic antigen and negative for prostate-specific antigen and S100 protein.2 These findings are pathognomonic for extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) and distinguish it from Bowen disease, or squamous cell carcinoma in situ, which typically arises in the penis and appears as a gradually enlarging, well-demarcated, velvety plaque.3 Human papillomavirus infection is a risk factor. Cells are typically cytokeratin 7 and carcinoembryonic antigen negative and p63 positive. Lichen sclerosis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by atrophic white plaques,3 typically occurs women’s anogenital area but has been reported in men and children and is treated with topical corticosteroids.4 Histologic features include a thinned epidermis; inflammation and altered fibroblast function lead to fibrosis of the papillary dermis.3 In a diabetic patient with a persistent rash nonresponsive to steroids, a fungal infection such as candida or tinea cruris can persist in the absence of antifungal therapies and be diagnosed by fungal culture.Extramammary Paget disease is an intraepithelial neoplasm affecting areas rich in apocrine sweat glands. Whereas Paget disease occurs most often in the nipple, EMPD is most common in the vulva of women and penoscrotal area of men 50 to 80 years old. It is usually associated with pruritus and has an insidious onset, presenting as an erythematous, pruritic plaque that may become ulcerated, scaly, or eczematous. Many patients are treated for eczema for years prior to definitive diagnosis. Other differential diagnoses include superficial spreading melanoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, mycosis fungoides, psoriasis, leukoplakia, eczema, or intraepidermal spread of visceral carcinoma.2Surgery is the standard treatment for EMPD, with an emphasis on obtaining negative margins to control the disease.1,2,5 Intraoperative frozen sections and Mohs surgery have been used to decrease the positive margin rate and risk of recurrence with good results.6 The extent of resection required to obtain negative margins is often much greater than the visible area of involvement of the disease, and frozen sections must be systematically performed. Workup should also include a computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis because EMPD may be associated with an underlying abdominal or genitourinary cancer (ie, colorectal, prostate, bladder, or kidney), although the frequency of this association is not consistently reported.1,2 Some centers also screen for a secondary cancer with chest x-ray, cystoscopy, colonoscopy, and serum prostate-specific antigen level. Lymph node dissection is indicated if clinical or pathologic lymph node metastases are present, and sentinel lymph node biopsy can be considered in cases of invasive disease.7 Hegarty et al1 reported a difference in median survival in patients with invasive disease compared with those with intraepidermal EMPD of 14.5 vs 55 months, respectively. Although the optimal regimen and timing have not been established, tumor responses have been described with several chemotherapy agents including mitomycin, vincristine sulfate, cisplatin, fluorouracil, and docetaxel for invasive disease.5 Radiation therapy is considered an alternative treatment when there are contraindications to surgical excision or when patients decline surgery. However, due to varying reports of effectiveness, its utility as a monotherapy is uncertain.8,9In summary, patients with pruritic, macular plaques unresponsive to topical therapies should undergo biopsy for definitive diagnosis. A benign initial diagnosis but worsening symptoms should prompt repeated biopsy. Once EMPD is diagnosed, an underlying cancer should be ruled out and surgical excision scheduled.Our patient underwent wide local excision with frozen section margin control with a scrotal advancement flap for reconstruction.

Whereas Paget disease occurs most often in the nipple, EMPD is most common in the vulva of women and penoscrotal area of men 50 to 80 years old. It is usually associated with pruritus and has an insidious onset, presenting as an erythematous, pruritic plaque that may become ulcerated, scaly, or eczematous.

During that evaluation, the patient reported that she had run in areas with dog feces on the ground and had eaten sheep meat (notably, not organ meat); she denied consuming canine meat.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Congenital cyst,Splenic abscess,Cystic metastasis to the spleen,Echinococcal disease,D. Echinococcal disease,D,Echinococcal disease,"Echinococcal disease is seen in areas in which the intermediate host— sheep— and the definitive host— canines— are in close proximity. The highest prevalence of the disease is seen in South America, Asia, and parts of Africa; in the United States, it is most commonly found in immigrants. Echinococcus granulosus is a cestode that survives within an accidental host—humans, who become hosts through contact with infected canine feces or ingesting infected sheep organ meat. The cestode forms cysts with large fluid collections and septations; daughter cysts may also be present. The liver is the most common site of infestation (55%-70%), followed by the lungs and spleen (2.5%).1 The disease is often asymptomatic, and while infection in childhood is common, the slow-growing cestode is often diagnosed in adulthood. When symptoms manifest, they are commonly caused by compression of adjacent structures; the presenting symptom is frequently a dull ache. Patients may also experience dyspepsia or constipation.1Initial workup should include CT scan and serologic tests for echinococcal titers. Findings on CT scan supportive of echinococcal disease include a nonenhancing mass that may be cystic or solid. Following the death of the helminths, a calcified wall may develop (Figure 1). Serologic studies have a relatively high sensitivity and remain positive until 1 year after the organism has been cleared. However, there is a high false-negative rate in extrahepatic disease.2 Despite the availability of CT imaging and serologic studies, Moro and Schantz3 suggested that calcification, presence of daughter cysts, and patient history are useful in establishing a diagnosis. The importance of diagnosing and treating echinococcal disease is because of the possible complications, which include infection, rupture, and fistulization. Broadly, rupture of the cyst leads to potentially fatal anaphylaxis. Specifically, of concern in a large splenic cyst is the likelihood of traumatic rupture. Splenectomy has therefore become the criterion standard of treatment4; however, antihelminthic drugs are used as adjunctive therapy. Recently, spleen-preserving therapy has become increasingly common, especially in children. Spleen-preserving operations are reserved for solitary, small, and superficial cysts.5 While isolated splenic hydatidosis is uncommon, the spleen is the third most common location of echinococcal cysts, and recognizing the risk factors and presentation are paramount to diagnosing this disease and preventing potentially fatal complications (Figure 2).Spleen in situ after mobilization and lysis of adhesion. The white area over the anterior aspect of the spleen is the capsule of the larger cyst. The posterior cyst was identified after the vessels were divided. The spleen and cysts were removed en bloc without violating their capsule.In this patient, a CT scan revealed multiple cysts, which the literature reports are generally not amenable to laparoscopic removal because laparoscopic removal is reserved for small superficial cysts.6 Similarly, the puncture, aspiration, injection, and reaspiration technique was not indicated because the serologic test results for echinococcal titers were negative. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that false positives are common, especially if the cyst is located within the lungs, brain, or spleen.5 Simple antihelminthic treatment was deemed insufficient owing to the possibility of traumatic rupture and subsequent anaphylaxis. Because of strong suspicion for echinococcal disease and location and size of the cysts, the decision was made to proceed with open splenectomy. The patient was treated preoperatively with albendazole and praziquantel. Diphenhydramine and corticosteroids were in the operating room during the procedure in the event of rupture. The smaller cyst seen on CT scan was found to be an accessory spleen; this was also removed. Pathologic examination of the cysts showed no evidence of echinococcal disease; hence, the cyst was determined to be a primary epithelial cyst. The presence of a cystic structure within the accessory spleen, patient’s travel history, and echinococcal false-positive rate make inactive echinococcal disease a likely diagnosis.",Surgery,"A woman in her 30s  was referred for evaluation of a large splenic cyst identified on a computed tomographic (CT) scan.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Congenital cyst,Splenic abscess,Cystic metastasis to the spleen,Echinococcal disease,D. Echinococcal disease,D,Echinococcal disease,"Echinococcal disease is seen in areas in which the intermediate host— sheep— and the definitive host— canines— are in close proximity. The highest prevalence of the disease is seen in South America, Asia, and parts of Africa; in the United States, it is most commonly found in immigrants. Echinococcus granulosus is a cestode that survives within an accidental host—humans, who become hosts through contact with infected canine feces or ingesting infected sheep organ meat. The cestode forms cysts with large fluid collections and septations; daughter cysts may also be present. The liver is the most common site of infestation (55%-70%), followed by the lungs and spleen (2.5%).1 The disease is often asymptomatic, and while infection in childhood is common, the slow-growing cestode is often diagnosed in adulthood. When symptoms manifest, they are commonly caused by compression of adjacent structures; the presenting symptom is frequently a dull ache. Patients may also experience dyspepsia or constipation.1Initial workup should include CT scan and serologic tests for echinococcal titers. Findings on CT scan supportive of echinococcal disease include a nonenhancing mass that may be cystic or solid. Following the death of the helminths, a calcified wall may develop (Figure 1). Serologic studies have a relatively high sensitivity and remain positive until 1 year after the organism has been cleared. However, there is a high false-negative rate in extrahepatic disease.2 Despite the availability of CT imaging and serologic studies, Moro and Schantz3 suggested that calcification, presence of daughter cysts, and patient history are useful in establishing a diagnosis. The importance of diagnosing and treating echinococcal disease is because of the possible complications, which include infection, rupture, and fistulization. Broadly, rupture of the cyst leads to potentially fatal anaphylaxis. Specifically, of concern in a large splenic cyst is the likelihood of traumatic rupture. Splenectomy has therefore become the criterion standard of treatment4; however, antihelminthic drugs are used as adjunctive therapy. Recently, spleen-preserving therapy has become increasingly common, especially in children. Spleen-preserving operations are reserved for solitary, small, and superficial cysts.5 While isolated splenic hydatidosis is uncommon, the spleen is the third most common location of echinococcal cysts, and recognizing the risk factors and presentation are paramount to diagnosing this disease and preventing potentially fatal complications (Figure 2).Spleen in situ after mobilization and lysis of adhesion. The white area over the anterior aspect of the spleen is the capsule of the larger cyst. The posterior cyst was identified after the vessels were divided. The spleen and cysts were removed en bloc without violating their capsule.In this patient, a CT scan revealed multiple cysts, which the literature reports are generally not amenable to laparoscopic removal because laparoscopic removal is reserved for small superficial cysts.6 Similarly, the puncture, aspiration, injection, and reaspiration technique was not indicated because the serologic test results for echinococcal titers were negative. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that false positives are common, especially if the cyst is located within the lungs, brain, or spleen.5 Simple antihelminthic treatment was deemed insufficient owing to the possibility of traumatic rupture and subsequent anaphylaxis.

A right-sided ovarian cyst measuring 6 cm in diameter was torsed and adherent to multiple small-bowel loops. The fallopian tube and round ligament were stretched across the terminal ileum, causing a complete small-bowel obstruction. The ovarian torsion occurred prenatally, with inflammation and dense adhesions occurring in the right lower quadrant. Surgery consisted of an ileocolectomy and right-sided salpingo-oophorectomy.

This may be attributed to a number of conditions, including malrotation, intestinal atresia, and Hirschsprung disease. To our knowledge, the associated finding of unilateral labial swelling has not been described in association with intestinal obstruction caused by ovarian torsion. Unilateral labial swelling in neonates is typically attributed to the residual effects of maternal estrogen or inguinal hernia. In this case, we believe that the ovarian cyst torsed with round ligament occlusion led to lymphovenous congestion, causing right-sided labial swelling.Treatment of ovarian cysts is controversial. Observation of simple asymptomatic cysts of less than 5 cm has been advocated. This poses a risk of future torsion.5 Larger neonatal ovarian cysts may be managed with aspiration or excision by open or laparoscopic techniques.Considering the rarity of this complication, it seems prudent to observe most neonates with antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts.

This may be attributed to a number of conditions, including malrotation, intestinal atresia, and Hirschsprung disease. To our knowledge, the associated finding of unilateral labial swelling has not been described in association with intestinal obstruction caused by ovarian torsion. Unilateral labial swelling in neonates is typically attributed to the residual effects of maternal estrogen or inguinal hernia.

Patients with metastases and those who received chemotherapy are more likely to have late complications.5 The length of the stent and the site of obstruction do not play a significant role in complication rates.6,7 However, more acute angular positioning of the stent increases the risk of bowel perforation.8Previous meta-analyses9,10 have found that the length of stay, mortality, medical complications, and stoma formation were reduced after self-expandable metal stent insertion for malignant bowel obstruction compared with emergency surgical intervention.Our patient’s stent angulation was acute.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Colon cancer perforation,Stent perforation,Acute mesenteric ischemia,Perforated diverticulitis,B. Stent perforation.,B,Stent perforation,"Computed tomography confirmed colonic stent perforation (Figure 1B). Exploratory laparotomy revealed extensive carcinomatosis. The stent perforation was close to the fistulous connections to the small bowel and bladder, and an en bloc resection was performed (Figure 2). The patient had a prolonged stay in the surgical intensive care unit while she underwent 4 operations, including abdominal washouts, a small-bowel anastomosis, descending colostomy creation, and Stamm gastrostomy tube placement, in anticipation of palliation for a bowel obstruction from her extensive carcinomatosis. After a 1-month hospitalization, she was discharged to hospice care and died 1 month later.The incidence of obstructed colon cancer is 30%.1 Often, these patients require emergency intervention but have a poor prognosis. Two options exist for management. Surgery, consisting of ostomy creation with or without resection of the primary tumor, has been the standard of care; more recently, self-expandable metal stents have been described in the palliative setting and as a bridge to curative surgery.In the early 1990s, Dohmoto et al2 described the use of self-expandable metal stents for the management of obstructing rectal cancers. When performed by experienced endoscopists, the procedure is associated with a high technical success rate and a low rate of procedural complications. In a series of 447 patients receiving colorectal stents, complications included 15 (3.4%) perforations, 3 (0.7%) deaths, 7 (1.6%) migrations, 7 (1.6%) cases of pain, and 2 (0.4%) cases of bleeding.3 Predictors of increased risk of perforation include bevacizumab therapy, whereas other studies4,5 have found no predictors of early complications. Patients with metastases and those who received chemotherapy are more likely to have late complications.5 The length of the stent and the site of obstruction do not play a significant role in complication rates.6,7 However, more acute angular positioning of the stent increases the risk of bowel perforation.8Previous meta-analyses9,10 have found that the length of stay, mortality, medical complications, and stoma formation were reduced after self-expandable metal stent insertion for malignant bowel obstruction compared with emergency surgical intervention.Our patient’s stent angulation was acute. She had extensive disease with multiple fistulas to the small bowel and bladder. We believe the aforementioned factors placed her at a high risk for stent perforation; thus, she would have been a better candidate for surgical intervention with a diverting ostomy. The patient did not want a stoma and was determined to start chemotherapy with the hope of future curative surgery. With stent placement, she would start chemotherapy within a week; with surgery, she would have to wait 4 to 6 weeks before the initiation of chemotherapy. For these reasons, stent placement was attempted.There are no randomized clinical trials to determine whether colonic stent placement in the setting of acute colonic obstruction is advantageous. The use of colonic stents for the management of obstructing colorectal cancers is a potential alternative to surgery in carefully selected patients. However, complications after stent placement can be catastrophic and challenging, as demonstrated in this case. A surgeon should be available to manage such complications.",Surgery,"A 73-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with 2 days of crampy abdominal pain and obstipation and 2 months of fecaluria and pneumaturia.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated subacute infarctions involving the left frontal and parietal hemispheres. She was a current smoker and was taking aspirin and statin medication at the time of presentation. Workup at another facility prior to transfer included computed tomographic angiography of the neck, which showed chronic occlusion of the right ICA and 95% stenosis of the left ICA.On examination, the patient was afebrile with a heart rate of 69 beats/min and blood pressure of 134/69 mm Hg.

We placed the patient on a heparin infusion. Owing to the high risk of recurrent stroke and contralateral ICA occlusion, we felt surgical intervention was indicated. The high bifurcation, distal FFT up to the second cervical vertebral level, potential for jaw subluxation, short neck and body habitus, and need for intraoperative shunt (contralateral ICA occlusion) made carotid endarterectomy anatomically a high-risk option. After extensive discussion with the patient, we proceeded with a left carotid stent with cerebrovascular protection. We traversed the stenosis and thrombus with a 0.014-inch filter wire with no resistance (SpiderFX) and placed a 6 × 8 × 30-mm nitinol stent (Figure 2).

Common risks to all interventions include distal embolization and potential thrombosis. Carotid endarterectomy has been the standard surgical therapy, with good reported results.1,3 Techniques for FFT treatment include distal isolation of the ICA without touching the bulb and thrombus retrieval through back-bleeding control and removal of residual thrombus manually or with a Fogarty catheter.4 Positive results have also been described with endovascular techniques, including carotid stenting, suction removal of the thrombus, and coiling of the affected artery.6,7 For carotid stenting, we used perioperative anticoagulation, low-profile devices, minimal bulb manipulation before deployment of the filter, and gentle postballoon dilation as strategies to avoid those risks.

They also lost more than 30 kg of weight during this period. Physical examination revealed acute cachexia with conjunctival pallor and an immobile nontender mass in the left upper abdomen. Them laboratory test results revealed a microcytic anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Abdominal computed tomography was performed (Figure 1). The patient was scheduled for exploratory laparotomy and resection.A large central necrotic mass is shown in this computed tomography image of the abdomen.,what is your diagnosis?,What is your diagnosis?,Gastrocolic fistula,Gastrointestinal stromal tumor with central necrosis,Gastric leiomyosarcoma,Gastrointestinal tuberculosis,a,1,0,1,1,neutral,0,0,54.0,51-60,,1394,augmented_neutral_fromfemale

These patients have a high incidence of cutaneous and neural tumors, as suggested by the history of acoustic neuroma and dermal neurofibromas seen on examination. Computed tomographic imaging demonstrated a large, septated mass arising from the duodenum. A retroperitoneal needle biopsy demonstrated a spindle-cell tumor, and immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD117 (C-KIT) and CD34 (platelet-derived growth factor receptor α [PDGFR-α]), indicative of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). As discussed below, NF1 patients have a high incidence of a special type of GIST, uniquely lacking C-KIT mutations, thereby causing resistance to imatinib mesylate therapy. Hence, surgical resection is the most effective treatment in these cases.During surgical exploration, a large, encapsulated mass (15 x 11 x 7.5 cm) was found arising from the lateral aspect of the second portion of the duodenum (Figure 2). Because of this location, a pancreaticoduodenectomy was necessary to render the patient disease-free. Pathologic analysis demonstrated negative margins and a high-grade lesion, with 15 mitotic figures per 50 high-power-fields. The patient recovered appropriately from his surgery and was discharged home.The final resected specimen. The gastrointestinal stromal tumor is seen arising from the second portion of the duodenum.This case highlights the disparity between immunohistochemical and molecular definitions of GISTs, and the growing complexity of our understanding of its pathophysiology. GISTs represent a variety of mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. As exemplified by our patient, spindle-cell histology and GI bleeding are common findings.1 Originally thought of as variants of leiomyomas or leiomyosarcomas, GISTs have been redefined due to advances in immunohistochemical staining, with nearly 95% expressing either CD117 (C-KIT) or CD34 (PDGFR-α).1 With advances in molecular biology, we now know that C-KIT and PDGFR-α are tyrosine kinase receptors heavily involved in cell signaling. Molecular analysis of most GISTs demonstrates “gain-of-function” mutations that constitutively activate these receptors, thus activating downstream RAS-MAP kinase pathways, promoting uncontrolled growth2,3 Most of these mutations are well-characterized and map to certain exons in the C-KIT and PDGFR-α genes. These C-KIT and PDGFR-α receptors are specifically targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, which has led to revolutionary treatment options for unresectable and metastatic GIST.1Neurofibromatosis type 1 shares a unique association with GIST, with the incidence of GIST in NF1 patients ranging from 5-25% in population-based studies.3,4 Although most NF1-associated GISTs demonstrate positive immunohistochemical staining for C-KIT, molecular analysis of these tumors shows that most express wild-type C-KIT and PDGFR-α receptors, which do not share the same mutations typically seen in non-NF1 sporadic GISTs.2,5 These wild-type receptors behave differently than the hyperactivated receptors typically found in non-NF1 GISTs, and the result is near-complete insensitivity to anti-tyrosine kinase therapy, despite positive immunohistochemical staining for C-KIT.2 Interestingly, NF1 is caused by a defect in the neurofibromin gene, which is a negative regulator of the RAS-Map kinase pathway.2,6 Thus, presumably the same downstream pathways are ultimately dysregulated in NF1 GIST disease, albeit by a different inciting mechanism – one which bypasses C-KIT and PDGFR-α.2,6 As a result, imatinib is typically ineffective in the treatment of NF1-associated GISTs. Indeed, molecular analysis confirmed that our patient had none of the typical C-KIT or PDGFR-α mutations seen in non-NF1 GISTs; therefore, resection was the only treatment option. As our understanding of the molecular biology behind GISTs evolves, mutational analysis has become increasingly important because of its ability to predict response to imatinib therapy.7,8 Six months after surgery, the patient remains disease-free.",Surgery,"A 72-year-old man presented to the hospital after sustaining a fall, with prior generalized weakness and fatigue.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor,B,Gastrointestinal stromal tumor,"This patient has neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). These patients have a high incidence of cutaneous and neural tumors, as suggested by the history of acoustic neuroma and dermal neurofibromas seen on examination. Computed tomographic imaging demonstrated a large, septated mass arising from the duodenum. A retroperitoneal needle biopsy demonstrated a spindle-cell tumor, and immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD117 (C-KIT) and CD34 (platelet-derived growth factor receptor α [PDGFR-α]), indicative of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). As discussed below, NF1 patients have a high incidence of a special type of GIST, uniquely lacking C-KIT mutations, thereby causing resistance to imatinib mesylate therapy. Hence, surgical resection is the most effective treatment in these cases.During surgical exploration, a large, encapsulated mass (15 x 11 x 7.5 cm) was found arising from the lateral aspect of the second portion of the duodenum (Figure 2). Because of this location, a pancreaticoduodenectomy was necessary to render the patient disease-free. Pathologic analysis demonstrated negative margins and a high-grade lesion, with 15 mitotic figures per 50 high-power-fields. The patient recovered appropriately from his surgery and was discharged home.The final resected specimen. The gastrointestinal stromal tumor is seen arising from the second portion of the duodenum.This case highlights the disparity between immunohistochemical and molecular definitions of GISTs, and the growing complexity of our understanding of its pathophysiology. GISTs represent a variety of mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. As exemplified by our patient, spindle-cell histology and GI bleeding are common findings.1 Originally thought of as variants of leiomyomas or leiomyosarcomas, GISTs have been redefined due to advances in immunohistochemical staining, with nearly 95% expressing either CD117 (C-KIT) or CD34 (PDGFR-α).1 With advances in molecular biology, we now know that C-KIT and PDGFR-α are tyrosine kinase receptors heavily involved in cell signaling. Molecular analysis of most GISTs demonstrates “gain-of-function” mutations that constitutively activate these receptors, thus activating downstream RAS-MAP kinase pathways, promoting uncontrolled growth2,3 Most of these mutations are well-characterized and map to certain exons in the C-KIT and PDGFR-α genes. These C-KIT and PDGFR-α receptors are specifically targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, which has led to revolutionary treatment options for unresectable and metastatic GIST.1Neurofibromatosis type 1 shares a unique association with GIST, with the incidence of GIST in NF1 patients ranging from 5-25% in population-based studies.3,4 Although most NF1-associated GISTs demonstrate positive immunohistochemical staining for C-KIT, molecular analysis of these tumors shows that most express wild-type C-KIT and PDGFR-α receptors, which do not share the same mutations typically seen in non-NF1 sporadic GISTs.2,5 These wild-type receptors behave differently than the hyperactivated receptors typically found in non-NF1 GISTs, and the result is near-complete insensitivity to anti-tyrosine kinase therapy, despite positive immunohistochemical staining for C-KIT.2 Interestingly, NF1 is caused by a defect in the neurofibromin gene, which is a negative regulator of the RAS-Map kinase pathway.2,6 Thus, presumably the same downstream pathways are ultimately dysregulated in NF1 GIST disease, albeit by a different inciting mechanism – one which bypasses C-KIT and PDGFR-α.2,6 As a result, imatinib is typically ineffective in the treatment of NF1-associated GISTs. Indeed, molecular analysis confirmed that our patient had none of the typical C-KIT or PDGFR-α mutations seen in non-NF1 GISTs; therefore, resection was the only treatment option. As our understanding of the molecular biology behind GISTs evolves, mutational analysis has become increasingly important because of its ability to predict response to imatinib therapy.7,8 Six months after surgery, the patient remains disease-free.",Surgery,"A 72-year-old patient presented to the hospital after sustaining a fall, with prior generalized weakness and fatigue.

Small-bowel volvulus,C,Small-bowel volvulus,"The CT scan revealed twisting of the mesenteric pedicles with the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) encircled by the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), which constituted a “whirl sign.” Moreover, despite the presence of good arterial blood flow in the bowel, both tapering and obstruction of the SMA were detected by a 3-dimensional reconstruction of the CT angiographic scan, which revealed typical corkscrew vessels (Figure 2A) suggestive of small-bowel volvulus (SBV). The patient underwent a laparotomy, which confirmed the diagnosis of SBV in a 720° counterclockwise rotation (Figure 2B). A 5-cm jejunal diverticulum, with adhesion to the transverse mesocolon located 50 cm below the ligament of Treitz, was identified as the cause of this volvulus, and some additional adhesion between the greater omentum and the right ovary that occurred owing to the influence of the oophorectomy complicated this phenomenon. Reduction of the volvulus, lysis of the adhesions, and resection of the jejunal diverticulum were performed. She had an uneventful recovery.A, Typical corkscrew vessels and both tapering and obstruction of the superior mesenteric artery are shown by use of a 3-dimensional reconstruction of a computed tomographic angiographic scan. B, Encircled loops of the small-bowel volvulus around the superior mesenteric artery.Whether the whirl sign, first described by Fisher,1 is a specific characteristic of SBV has been controversial.2 This sign was found to be a nonspecific result of any process that causes twisting or rotation of the mesentery and its contents.3 This sign predicts the need for surgical intervention for small-bowel obstruction.4 The best method for the detection of SBV by determining the existence of corkscrew vessels is by use of a 3-dimensional reconstruction of an CT angiographic scan, which can preoperatively reveal the peripheral blood flow of the small bowel from collateral vessels despite the obstruction of the SMA. For the present patient, we could not detect postoperatively any tapering or obstruction of the SMA or SMV on the 3-dimensional reconstruction of the CT scan.The whirl sign may indicate the possibility of reversible volvulus of the small bowel. We believe that this is why our patient had a long recurrent history of SBV. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the whirl sign is not an ominous sign. Without surgery, our patient would have continued to be in danger of having massive bowel necrosis. The indication for surgery in such a case should depend on the patient’s abdominal physical signs and symptoms, and not on the CT scans alone. Cases in which the entire small bowel revolves on the thick root of both the SMA and the SMV may lead to reversibility of the volvulus.In our patient, a jejunal diverticulum 5 cm in size existed on the opposite side of the mesentery; pathologically, it was not congenital jejunal duplication but multiple diverticula. Cases of SBV involving a jejunal diverticulum have been reported more often in Asia than in the West.5-7 The incidence of diverticulum of the jejunum may be high in Asia. It is reported that small-bowel diverticulum in older people is an independent risk factor for SBV,8 and large diverticulum of the small bowel, in particular, might play a contributing role in the occurrence of SBV in adults.9 In light of the findings pertaining to our patient, the swinging of the jejunal diverticulum due to its position, size, weight, and adhesion or the presence of a long mobile mesentery and a shorter mesenteric base10 may be necessary for this rare condition to occur.",Surgery,"A 90-year-old patient presented with vomiting and acute abdominal pain that started 24 hours earlier.

The diagnosis was made intraoperatively and confirmed with final pathology, because it was unclear from the imaging results where the mass originated.The decision was made to proceed with surgical resection given the large size of the mass and resulting compression of adjacent visceral structures apparent on imaging and the patient’s symptomatic presentation. Surgical exploration was initiated through a midline incision. Exposure of the left-sided upper quadrant mass was obtained by entering the lesser space through mobilization of the greater omentum off the transverse colon and mesocolon, as well as by taking down the splenic flexure and mobilization of the proximal descending colon. The pancreas and spleen were then rotated medially and superiorly to expose the 13-cm retroperitoneal cyst, which was displacing the left kidney into the pelvis (Figure 2). This cystic mass appeared to arise from the left adrenal gland with remaining adrenal tissue splayed over the anterior surface of the cyst. Partial left adrenalectomy was performed with the cyst en bloc. Final pathologic examination revealed a simple adrenal cyst abutting a histologically unremarkable adrenal gland. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home on postoperative day 7.Cystic mass (asterisk) with overlying adrenal tissue indicated by the point of the forceps, dissected free from the adjacent kidney (arrowhead).Adrenal cysts are rare, with an incidence of 0.06% to 0.18% reported in autopsy studies.1 Although adrenal cysts have classically presented with symptoms of abdominal or flank pain, palpable mass, or gastrointestinal symptoms, radiographic imaging has come to play an increasingly larger role in the diagnosis of these cystic masses, with one-third of adrenal cysts now discovered incidentally.2-4Most commonly, cystic adrenal masses present as pseudocysts, which account for 56% to 78% of clinically symptomatic cysts. However, adrenal cysts may be endothelial (19%-24%), epithelial (2.4%-6%), or parasitic (2%) cysts.3,4 Endothelial or “simple” cysts, as seen in the patient described in the present report, are defined by the presence of a smooth, thin, nonproliferative endothelial lining. Although they are less likely to be symptomatic, simple cysts are the most common subtype of adrenal cyst diagnosed on autopsy studies,1 with an incidence of 45%. Endothelial cysts can be further classified as lymphangiomatous (arising from lymphatic ectasia) or angiomatous (arising from vascular ectasia) in origin.2,5Most cystic adrenal masses may be managed conservatively. However, surgical intervention is generally recommended for symptomatic or functional cysts and for cystic masses that appear on imaging to be large (>4-5 cm), hemorrhagic, or heterogeneous.6 In the present case, surgical excision was indicated given the large size of the cyst and its symptomatic nature.",Surgery,"A patient in them 30s with a history of chronic hepatitis B was found on computed tomography to have a 13-cm retroperitoneal mass on them left side with a significant mass effect. The patient was symptomatic with intermittent left upper quadrant abdominal pain that was associated with nausea and constipation. They reported no other gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or overall symptoms. In addition to chronic hepatitis B, them medical history was notable for hypertension and them surgical history was significant for a recent liver biopsy. Physical examination revealed a soft, nontender, minimally distended abdomen with no palpable masses and no costovertebral angle tenderness.Laboratory test results at presentation revealed complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and amylase values within the reference ranges and a hepatitis B virus quantification level of 1590 IU/mL.

Only 12 other case reports of isolated SL without lymphangiomatosis involving other organs have appeared in the literature to date.1-12 The diagnosis of SL is often made only after infectious, hematologic, malignant, and congenital causes have been ruled out. In our patient, because of the extent of the compressive symptoms related to her massive spleen and an unclear diagnosis after an extensive laboratory workup, splenectomy was recommended. She underwent an open splenectomy through a left subcostal incision.

Less frequently, PAPVRs occur between the left pulmonary venous system and the left brachiocephalic vein. Embryologically, PAPVRs are likely due to failure of regression of primitive lung drainage systems that connect each lung bud to the systemic system. As the embryo develops and the lungs mature, these connections normally regress and the pulmonary veins develop, connecting the lungs to the left atrium. Persistence of the primordial vein results in PAPVR.1 Autopsy and surgical series have suggested a PAPVR prevalence of 0.4% and have indicated that right-sided anomalous connections are 10 times more common than left.2,3 More recent advancements in imaging technology suggest that these anatomical variants may occur as rarely as 0.1% to 0.2% in the adult population, with nearly 50% present on the left side.4Although commonly asymptomatic, PAPVR can result in pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. As left-to-right shunting increases, volume overload of the pulmonary circulation leads to pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension.1,5 Pulmonary hypertension can be treated medically, and if there is dual drainage of the involved lung territory, minimally invasive embolization of the anomalous veins can be performed.6 In moderate to severe disease with a left-sided PAPVR, surgical treatment involves relocation of anomalous drainage to the left atrium.

While perhaps indicated with a known PAPVR, this may not be necessary if routine postprocedure chest radiography is performed to confirm catheter position.

Catheterization of left anomalous pulmonary vein,C,Catheterization of left anomalous pulmonary vein,"Venous blood gas obtained from the catheter tip prior to removal demonstrated the following values: pH, 7.44; Pco2, 28 mm Hg; Po2, 110 mm Hg; and bicarbonate concentration, 19 mEq/L. Concurrent arterial blood gas values were the following: pH, 7.48; Pco2, 25 mm Hg; Po2, 89 mm Hg; and bicarbonate concentration, 18 mEq/L.Later in the hospital course, contrast-enhanced computed tomography was used to assess for pulmonary emboli. In addition to multiple subsegmental emboli, the images and 3-dimensional reconstructions revealed a partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection from the left upper lobe to the left innominate vein, entering opposite the left internal jugular vein (Figure 2).Three-dimensional reconstruction of computed tomography with intravenous contrast demonstrating partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (arrowhead) of the vein from the left upper lung to the left subclavian vein.Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) is a rare congenital defect in which a connection exists between the pulmonary veins and the systemic venous system. Location varies, but the most common and anatomically consistent PAPVRs originate from the right pulmonary venous system and drain to the right atrium, superior vena cava, or inferior vena cava (Scimitar syndrome). Less frequently, PAPVRs occur between the left pulmonary venous system and the left brachiocephalic vein. Embryologically, PAPVRs are likely due to failure of regression of primitive lung drainage systems that connect each lung bud to the systemic system. As the embryo develops and the lungs mature, these connections normally regress and the pulmonary veins develop, connecting the lungs to the left atrium. Persistence of the primordial vein results in PAPVR.1 Autopsy and surgical series have suggested a PAPVR prevalence of 0.4% and have indicated that right-sided anomalous connections are 10 times more common than left.2,3 More recent advancements in imaging technology suggest that these anatomical variants may occur as rarely as 0.1% to 0.2% in the adult population, with nearly 50% present on the left side.4Although commonly asymptomatic, PAPVR can result in pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. As left-to-right shunting increases, volume overload of the pulmonary circulation leads to pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension.1,5 Pulmonary hypertension can be treated medically, and if there is dual drainage of the involved lung territory, minimally invasive embolization of the anomalous veins can be performed.6 In moderate to severe disease with a left-sided PAPVR, surgical treatment involves relocation of anomalous drainage to the left atrium. In a right-sided anomalous connection, the vein is most commonly relocated to the right atrium or right atrial appendage and an intracardiac tunnel or baffle is constructed in combination with a created or preexisting atrial septal defect to direct blood flow to the left atrium.Catheter placement in PAPVRs has been described,7,8 and Chintu et al7 advocate for routine fluoroscopy during catheter placement. While perhaps indicated with a known PAPVR, this may not be necessary if routine postprocedure chest radiography is performed to confirm catheter position. Physicians who place central venous catheters should be aware of PAPVR as a possible cause of catheter malposition. If this phenomenon is suspected, attempts should be made to confirm the presence of PAPVR and evaluate for hemodynamic effects.",Surgery,"A patient in their mid-50s presented to the hospital with malaise, fevers, hypotension, and altered mental status. Three months prior, they had an episode of native aortic valve endocarditis, necessitating aortic valve replacement with a pericardial bioprosthesis. They developed postoperative acute renal failure, which progressed to chronic renal failure requiring dialysis via tunneled catheter. On this admission, they was found to have methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a vegetation on their prosthetic aortic valve. They was diagnosed as having MRSA prosthetic valve endocarditis and admitted to the cardiovascular surgical intensive care unit prior to surgical intervention.In the setting of MRSA bacteremia, their tunneled dialysis catheter had been removed. Owing to their dialysis needs, a temporary dialysis catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein. As intravenous access was required for vasoactive medications and intravenous antibiotics, a triple-lumen central catheter was placed in the left internal jugular vein under ultrasonographic guidance. The catheter went in easily without resistance, was drop tested to confirm venous placement, and flushed and drew easily, and venous waveforms and pressures were transduced. However, on postprocedure radiography, the tip of the triple-lumen catheter was not in the expected location (Figure 1).

The appendix could not be identified at the confluence of the teniae, and any careful attempt to reduce the intussuscepted appendix was unsuccessful. Given the risk of disseminating neoplastic cells if this was a carcinoid tumor or an adenocarcinoma or if foci of endometriosis were present, we decided to convert the procedure to open surgery (using a small, infraumbilical incision). The intussuscepted appendix on manual examination was extremely enlarged and remained difficult to reduce. It was very close to the ileocecal valve; therefore, we decided to perform an ileocecectomy. When the specimen was opened, the entire appendix appeared inverted (complete intussusception of the appendix, type V, according to the McSwain classification).1 Histologic examination of the specimen revealed several foci of previously unsuspected endometriosis. The patient’s recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged home on postoperative day 5. She was evaluated by a gynecologist and began receiving hormonal suppression of endometriosis.Intussusception of the appendix is a very rare condition, estimated to be 0.01% in a large historical study on surgical specimens of human appendixes.2 Since the first report by McKidd3 in a 7-year-old boy in 1858, the literature on AI has been limited to case reports or very small case series because of the rarity of this condition.4 In addition, endometriosis as a cause of AI is even more rare, with only 38 cases published.5,6 In fact, when endometriosis involves the gastrointestinal tract (usually one-third of patients with pelvic endometriosis), it commonly involves the rectosigmoid (72%) or the rectovaginal septum (13%) but rarely the appendix (3%).7 In the largest series published to date,8,9 the prevalence of endometriosis of the appendix ranged from 0.02% to 0.8%.Lesions within the lumen of the appendix may act as lead points for AI: peristalsis of the bowel loops drags the lesion forward and causes the invagination of a bowel loop with its mesenteric fold into the lumen of an adjacent portion of bowel. The most common cause of intussusception in children is appendiceal inflammation; among adults, inflammation as the cause is far less common. Endometriosis (33%) with hyperplasia or hypertrophy of the muscularis propria, adenoma/adenocarcinoma (17%), mucocele (14%), and carcinoid tumors (7%) are causes in most of the adult cases.2 A mobile appendix and mesoappendix as well as a wide appendicular lumen make AI more likely.10 An anatomical classification proposed in 1941 by McSwain1 and still in use is based on the portion of the appendix invaginated, ranging from type I (only the tip of the appendix) to type V (the entire appendix, as in our case).In adults, the intussuscepted appendix should be removed for 2 reasons: eventually AI will recur, causing symptoms, and the appendiceal lesion, which acts as lead point and causes the intussusception, may be malignant. Unfortunately, the nature of AI cannot be determined preoperatively in most, if not all, cases. At best, it can be suspected, for example, in women with a history of endometriosis. Colonoscopy reduction of an intussuscepted appendix is not recommended because of the risk of perforation and dissemination of a potentially malignant lesion with peritoneal seeding. Appendectomy is considered adequate when AI involves only the tip or the base of the appendix and can be easily reduced in the abdominal cavity. However, in case of complete intussusception of the appendix with a large mass close to the ileocecal valve, a lesion involving the base of the appendix, or a suspected malignant mucinous lesion, ileocecal resection or right hemicolectomy should be performed, either laparoscopically or with open incision, to achieve an adequate tumor-free margin. If endometriosis is suspected because of the patient’s medical history, laparoscopy is strongly recommended: if endometriosis is present it can reveal (although not in our case) yellow-brown discoloration of small patches in the ovaries, broad ligament, and other abnormalities, allowing a full evaluation of the extent of the disease. Gentle traction should be applied to the appendix in cases of AI with endometriosis, as with other causes of AI in adults.

What Is the Diagnosis?",Recurrent prostatic carcinoma,Neurofibroma,Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor,Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor,D. Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor,D,Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor,"Although pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors (PFTs) are rare, they are an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of spindle cell tumors. Since first reported in the lung in 1954,1 PFTs have been reported in various organs2 and described by other names, including pseudosarcoma, inflammatory pseudotumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferation, and postoperative spindle cell nodule. Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors are thought to occur via a benign fibroproliferative process and to develop atypical spindle cell features that are often associated with a recent history of surgical procedures. Typically, few mitoses are seen, and there is often a clear inflammatory component.3 However, PFTs are frequently misinterpreted as sarcomas. Sections of our patient’s tumor demonstrated spindle cell proliferation with bundles of relatively bland, tapered cells arranged in a swirling pattern. These cells were intermixed with smooth muscle bundles and overlying urothelial mucosa, consistent with bladder wall infiltration. Mitoses were rare, and there was a focal infiltrate of inflammatory cells. Trichrome stain revealed diffuse collagenous fibrosis. Immunohistochemical stains were useful in differentiating PFTs from other entities.The results of immunohistochemical stains were positive for smooth muscle actin, patchy positive for desmin, and focally positive for pan-keratin. There were scattered S100-positive cells. The differential diagnosis included leiomyosarcoma, given the smooth muscle actin and desmin positivity. However, leiomyosarcomas typically do not stain with keratin. A diagnosis of sarcoma or sarcomatoid carcinoma was considered, but the proliferative index was minimal (MIB1 [OMIM 608677] <1%) and the cytologic features were bland. CD34 negativity helped exclude vascular tumors. The S100 staining suggested the possibility of a liposarcoma, but our patient’s negative MDM2 and CDK4 immunostain results made this diagnosis less likely.4 Finally, KIT (OMIM 164920) negativity helped exclude a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.The finding that scattered cells were positive for S100 also suggested a neural tumor type, such as a neurofibroma, an intriguing possibility given the patient’s family history. However, neurofibromas in the bladder are rare, with only 60 reported cases.5 Neurofibromas are characterized by loosely arranged hypocellular fascicles with scattered spindle cells and collagen bundles.Our patient’s condition did not demonstrate these findings. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can occur spontaneously or in the setting of neurofibromatosis 1. These are rare tumors (incidence of 1 in 1 000 000 population) and typically have poor prognoses. An atypical neurofibroma can often mimic a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, but the latter is a true malignant tumor with variably increased cellularity, pleomorphism, mitotic figures, and aggressive phenotype.Having used combined clinical, radiographic, pathologic, and immunohistochemical findings to rule out other tumor types in the differential diagnosis, a final diagnosis of PFT was made. Although the term pseudosarcoma would suggest a benign biological process, these tumors can recur locally and metastasize hematogenously. On searching PubMed (with the keywords inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor), we identified 48 publications in which 31 of 409 patients (7.6%) developed metastatic disease. In one report, the rate of local recurrence and metastatic disease were as high as 55.9% and 10.9%, respectively.6 Given these risks, surgical resection with negative margins is the mainstay of treatment for these tumors. In scenarios in which the disease is considered unresectable or when the patient’s comorbidities prohibit an operation, nonsurgical options may be considered. Because nearly 50% of them possess TPM3-ALK (OMIM 191030 and 105590) rearrangements that induce malignant transformation, these tumors may respond to ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib.7 This treatment may be used for converting unresectable to potentially resectable disease.Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors are rare lesions that surgeons must consider within the appropriate clinical context. Although most PFTs are considered benign, these tumors have the potential to behave in a malignant fashion. Surgical therapy remains the criterion standard for treatment of this disease. After resection of his PFT, our patient has had no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastases.",Surgery,"A 66-year-old man was doing well 6 months after robotic radical prostatectomy for prostatic carcinoma and synchronous left radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma.

Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor,D,Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor,"Although pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors (PFTs) are rare, they are an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of spindle cell tumors. Since first reported in the lung in 1954,1 PFTs have been reported in various organs2 and described by other names, including pseudosarcoma, inflammatory pseudotumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferation, and postoperative spindle cell nodule. Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors are thought to occur via a benign fibroproliferative process and to develop atypical spindle cell features that are often associated with a recent history of surgical procedures. Typically, few mitoses are seen, and there is often a clear inflammatory component.3 However, PFTs are frequently misinterpreted as sarcomas. Sections of our patient’s tumor demonstrated spindle cell proliferation with bundles of relatively bland, tapered cells arranged in a swirling pattern. These cells were intermixed with smooth muscle bundles and overlying urothelial mucosa, consistent with bladder wall infiltration. Mitoses were rare, and there was a focal infiltrate of inflammatory cells. Trichrome stain revealed diffuse collagenous fibrosis. Immunohistochemical stains were useful in differentiating PFTs from other entities.The results of immunohistochemical stains were positive for smooth muscle actin, patchy positive for desmin, and focally positive for pan-keratin. There were scattered S100-positive cells. The differential diagnosis included leiomyosarcoma, given the smooth muscle actin and desmin positivity. However, leiomyosarcomas typically do not stain with keratin. A diagnosis of sarcoma or sarcomatoid carcinoma was considered, but the proliferative index was minimal (MIB1 [OMIM 608677] <1%) and the cytologic features were bland. CD34 negativity helped exclude vascular tumors. The S100 staining suggested the possibility of a liposarcoma, but our patient’s negative MDM2 and CDK4 immunostain results made this diagnosis less likely.4 Finally, KIT (OMIM 164920) negativity helped exclude a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.The finding that scattered cells were positive for S100 also suggested a neural tumor type, such as a neurofibroma, an intriguing possibility given the patient’s family history. However, neurofibromas in the bladder are rare, with only 60 reported cases.5 Neurofibromas are characterized by loosely arranged hypocellular fascicles with scattered spindle cells and collagen bundles.Our patient’s condition did not demonstrate these findings. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can occur spontaneously or in the setting of neurofibromatosis 1. These are rare tumors (incidence of 1 in 1 000 000 population) and typically have poor prognoses. An atypical neurofibroma can often mimic a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, but the latter is a true malignant tumor with variably increased cellularity, pleomorphism, mitotic figures, and aggressive phenotype.Having used combined clinical, radiographic, pathologic, and immunohistochemical findings to rule out other tumor types in the differential diagnosis, a final diagnosis of PFT was made. Although the term pseudosarcoma would suggest a benign biological process, these tumors can recur locally and metastasize hematogenously. On searching PubMed (with the keywords inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor), we identified 48 publications in which 31 of 409 patients (7.6%) developed metastatic disease. In one report, the rate of local recurrence and metastatic disease were as high as 55.9% and 10.9%, respectively.6 Given these risks, surgical resection with negative margins is the mainstay of treatment for these tumors. In scenarios in which the disease is considered unresectable or when the patient’s comorbidities prohibit an operation, nonsurgical options may be considered. Because nearly 50% of them possess TPM3-ALK (OMIM 191030 and 105590) rearrangements that induce malignant transformation, these tumors may respond to ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib.7 This treatment may be used for converting unresectable to potentially resectable disease.Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors are rare lesions that surgeons must consider within the appropriate clinical context.

The small bowel, colon, liver, and spleen were inspected, and no additional injuries were observed. Pathologic examination of the uterine fibroid revealed a leiomyoma with focal degenerative changes.Uterine leiomyomas are common benign tumors, with an estimated cumulative incidence in women as high as 70% by 50 years of age.1 The most common complication of leiomyomas is abnormal uterine bleeding, although bulk-related symptoms (pelvic and/or abdominal pain, urinary frequency, constipation, and back pain) and dysmenorrhea are also common. Less commonly, uterine leiomyomas may cause acute pain due to degeneration or torsion of a pedunculated subserosal tumor. Despite the high incidence of uterine leiomyomas, hemoperitoneum as a result of tumor disruption is rare. Fewer than 100 cases have been reported in the literature,2 with most describing hemoperitoneum due to venous rupture as a result of tumor size larger than 10 cm.3 There is one reported case of a 46-year-old patient from France who presented with significant hemoperitoneum from an avulsed pedunculated uterine leiomyoma after she fell while jogging.4 There have also been a handful of reports of hemoperitoneum that resulted from ruptured pedunculated gastric myomas.5 However, traumatic presentations of avulsed benign, pedunculated abdominal tumors are rare.Our case is notable because it highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment of a patient with traumatic hemoperitoneum secondary to blunt trauma. Although the patient was tachycardic, her blood pressure and physical examination findings were stable enough to allow for computed tomography of the abdomen to evaluate for intraabdominal injury. The heterogeneous uterus noted on the patient’s imaging was, in retrospect, predictive of the intraoperative findings because uterine leiomyomas typically present as distorted soft-tissue densities on computed tomographic images. An alternative imaging approach would have been to perform a focused assessment with sonography for trauma examination at the bedside, which would have been the diagnostic method of choice had the patient been hemodynamically unstable. However, approximately 100 mL of hemoperitoneum is required before it can be detected by ultrasonography, and the source of bleeding is usually difficult to identify.6 Of note, ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for uterine leiomyomas.The injuries most commonly associated with blunt abdominal trauma include fractured solid organs, including the liver, spleen, and kidney, and ruptured viscous (usually duodenal rupture) and pelvic bone fractures with associated venous or urogenital injury.

Pathologic examination of the uterine fibroid revealed a leiomyoma with focal degenerative changes.Uterine leiomyomas are common benign tumors, with an estimated cumulative incidence in women as high as 70% by 50 years of age.1 The most common complication of leiomyomas is abnormal uterine bleeding, although bulk-related symptoms (pelvic and/or abdominal pain, urinary frequency, constipation, and back pain) and dysmenorrhea are also common. Less commonly, uterine leiomyomas may cause acute pain due to degeneration or torsion of a pedunculated subserosal tumor. Despite the high incidence of uterine leiomyomas, hemoperitoneum as a result of tumor disruption is rare. Fewer than 100 cases have been reported in the literature,2 with most describing hemoperitoneum due to venous rupture as a result of tumor size larger than 10 cm.3 There is one reported case of a 46-year-old patient from France who presented with significant hemoperitoneum from an avulsed pedunculated uterine leiomyoma after she fell while jogging.4 There have also been a handful of reports of hemoperitoneum that resulted from ruptured pedunculated gastric myomas.5 However, traumatic presentations of avulsed benign, pedunculated abdominal tumors are rare.Our case is notable because it highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment of a patient with traumatic hemoperitoneum secondary to blunt trauma. Although the patient was tachycardic, her blood pressure and physical examination findings were stable enough to allow for computed tomography of the abdomen to evaluate for intraabdominal injury. The heterogeneous uterus noted on the patient’s imaging was, in retrospect, predictive of the intraoperative findings because uterine leiomyomas typically present as distorted soft-tissue densities on computed tomographic images. An alternative imaging approach would have been to perform a focused assessment with sonography for trauma examination at the bedside, which would have been the diagnostic method of choice had the patient been hemodynamically unstable. However, approximately 100 mL of hemoperitoneum is required before it can be detected by ultrasonography, and the source of bleeding is usually difficult to identify.6 Of note, ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for uterine leiomyomas.The injuries most commonly associated with blunt abdominal trauma include fractured solid organs, including the liver, spleen, and kidney, and ruptured viscous (usually duodenal rupture) and pelvic bone fractures with associated venous or urogenital injury. Although this patient’s final diagnosis was rare, as with any patient who presents after blunt trauma, a detailed physical examination and expedited imaging and operative management were essential to her favorable outcome.",Surgery,"A 33-year-old patient presented to the emergency department as a restrained driver in a motor vehicle collision with air bag deployment. The patient had diffuse lower abdominal pain with nausea and one episode of emesis. Them vital signs were notable for a blood pressure of 108/69 mm Hg and a heart rate of 124 beats/min.

The diagnosis was made radiographically based on the presence of classic computed tomography findings, including targetlike and sausage-shaped masses, a rim of oral contrast encircling the intussusceptum, and the pathognomonic bowel-within-bowel appearance of intraluminal mesenteric fat and vessels (Figure 1).1Although the patient had hoped to avoid surgery based on her religious beliefs, nonoperative management failed at 11 months and she agreed to an operation. Intraoperatively, the intussusception extended from the ileocolic junction to mid-descending colon and was reduced primarily to reveal complete inversion of the appendix into the cecum. An ileocecectomy with primary ileocolonic anastomosis was performed and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 5. The appendix was reduced in the postoperative specimen and noted to be grossly fibrotic.This patient had a history of juvenile polyposis syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple gastrointestinal hamartomas in the colon or rectum (98%), stomach (14%), small bowel (7%), and duodenum (2%).2 Final pathology revealed a clustering of at least 8 juvenile polyps in the cecum extending into the appendiceal orifice, which was noted on colonoscopy performed during the patient’s first admission (Figure 2). Prior to surgery, an ileal mass was suspected as the most likely lead point for intussusception. However, intraoperative findings and final pathology suggested a different mechanism whereby the appendiceal masses initiated an appendiceal intussusception that then served as the mechanical lead point for ileocolic intussusception. Alternatively, the mass of cecal polyps may have acted as the initial lead point for intestinal intussusception and caused a secondary or simultaneous appendiceal intussusception by tethering the base of the appendix.Colonoscopic view of the cecum demonstrating extension of a cluster of juvenile polyps extending into the appendiceal orifice (arrowhead). Image courtesy of Eduardo Gonzalez-Velez, MD.Intussusception is a rare cause of bowel obstruction in adults, accounting for less than 1% of obstructions and 5% of total intussusception cases.1,3-6 Symptoms are nonspecific, often chronic or subacute, and include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and blood per rectum. Surgical management is generally indicated since up to 90% of cases are associated with an underlying pathological process, such as benign and malignant tumors, vascular anomalies, and inflammatory lesions that act as anatomical lead points.3-6 Appendiceal intussusception is even more rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.01% based on a study of 71 000 human appendix surgical specimens.7 Patients may present acutely with symptoms mimicking appendicitis or have a more protracted history of nonspecific, intermittent symptoms similar to intestinal intussusception. Adult women are disproportionately affected (76% of adult cases, 54% of all cases), with appendiceal endometriosis as the most commonly identified lead point in adults (33%). Additional causes include mucocele (19%), inflammation (19%), adenoma (11%), carcinoid (7%), and adenocarcinoma (6%).8,9Intramural and intraluminal gastrointestinal lesions are believed to cause intussusception by altering normal peristaltic activity, resulting in more vigorous and frequent peristaltic contractions meant to expel the offending lesion. For bowel, this may result in invagination or telescoping of one segment of the bowel (the “intussusceptum”) into the other (the “intussuscipiens”).1-4 For the appendix, in the setting of appropriate anatomic factors such as a fetal-type cecum, mobile mesoappendix, or wide proximal appendicular lumen, partial or total inversion into the cecum may occur.9 Appendiceal intussusception puts the patient at high risk for developing intestinal intussusception, as was likely the case for this patient, because the inverted appendix has been shown to act as a lead point for a subsequent compound ileocolic intussusception.8-10",Surgery,"A 34-year-old female Jehovah’s Witness presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of colicky lower abdominal pain, nausea without vomiting, and constipation after passing a single small bloody bowel movement.

Iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis,C,Iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis,"Since the performance of the first successful pancreas transplant by Kelly and colleagues1 in 1966, the field has witnessed over the last 2 decades a steady increase in the number of pancreas transplants performed. With successive advances in organ preservation, immunosuppression, and operative techniques, combined kidney-pancreas transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with chronic kidney disease and insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus. Nearly 1000 pancreas transplants are performed in the United States annually, and with improving long-term graft functional success rates positively impacting patient survival,2 more and more adult, previously diabetic patients are alive with functioning pancreas transplants.3 Thus, it is important that all health care providers be familiar with the basic anatomy of a pancreas transplant, which receives arterial blood supply from the recipient iliac artery most commonly via a donor iliac Y graft and whose venous outflow can either be constructed via a donor portal vein anastomosis to the systemic venous system (via the iliac vein or inferior vena cava) or to the portal venous system (via the superior mesenteric vein). Pseudoaneurysms of the pancreas transplant arterial anastomoses have been reported and may be due to an error in anastomotic surgical technique, intra-abdominal infections, or injury during percutaneous pancreas transplant biopsies.4 Increasingly, endovascular prostheses are being used to treat arterial disease owing to a growing list of indications ever since the description of their first use by Sigwart et al5 in 1987. As atherosclerotic arteries are commonly encountered in diabetic patients, it would not be unexpected that interventional radiologists and cardiologists may see patients with prior pancreas transplants. The interventionist who performed the stent grafting in our patient was unaware of the fact that the feeding artery to the pancreas transplant was involved. We believe the best course of action would have been an open surgical repair and bypass, which is well described in the literature.4In the case of our patient, a diagnosis of pancreas transplant thrombosis due to occlusion of the inflow artery to the pancreas transplant was entertained and the patient was urgently transferred to our facility. Interestingly, the patient’s serum amylase and lipase levels were within normal range and his blood glucose was only mildly elevated (highest of 131 mg/dL). The patient underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy and intraoperative findings were consistent with thrombosis of the inflow artery.

Angioleiomyoma,B,Angioleiomyoma,"Angioleiomyomas are benign, well-circumscribed, soft-tissue tumors of mesodermal origin arising from fascicular proliferation of smooth-muscle cells of the vascular tunica media.1 These tumors are rare and account for only 5% of benign soft-tissue neoplasms. Although the etiology of angioleiomyomas is unknown, evidence suggests trauma, chronic inflammation, venous stasis, and hormonal changes may play a role. Angioleiomyomas arise more often from veins than from arteries, and there have been reported cases involving vessels and in a variety of anatomical locations. However, a literature review did not reveal a single reported case of a common hepatic artery angioleiomyoma.Most patients with angioleiomyomas are female and usually present in the fourth to sixth decades of life with a small, solitary, slow-growing nodule within the subcuticular or deep dermal layers of the skin, usually in the lower extremities, head and neck, or trunk.2 Pain is the most common clinical feature associated with approximately 60% of cases. The pain is thought to be mediated by nerve endings within the tumor capsule responding to mechanical stretching or inflammation induced by mast cells.3Histologically, these tumors feature bundles of spindle smooth-muscle cells interlaced with vascular channels surrounded by a thin capsule.1 Degenerative changes with hyalinisation, myxoid changes, and calcification are sometimes seen. Angioleiomyomas are categorized into 3 histological types, namely solid, venous, and cavernous.4 The solid type is the most common and is characterized by closely compacted smooth muscle and many small, slitlike vascular channels. Thick muscular walls distinguish the venous type. The cavernous type is the least common and is differentiated by dilated vascular channels with a paucity of smooth muscle. Fine-needle aspiration is usually not sufficient to permit histotype diagnosis.Immunohistological examination of angioleiomyomas typically demonstrates uniform smooth-muscle cells that strongly express desmin and smooth-muscle actin. Angioleiomyomas usually lack nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and necrosis typically seen in malignant tumors with smooth-muscle differentiation such as leiomyosarcomas.5 CD34 expression in vascular compartments, but not in the tumor stroma, distinguishes angioleiomyomas from primary vascular neoplasms and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.6 In addition, the absence of cytologic atypia and interanastomosing vascular architecture excludes angiosarcoma. Karyotype analyses of angioleiomyomas have not demonstrated consistent chromosome aberrations although a number have been described.7Evaluation by ultrasonography reveals a well-defined, homogeneous, hypoechoic lesion that may demonstrate some posterior acoustic enhancement.8 Spectral Doppler analysis usually reveals considerable hypervascularity with waveforms of low resistance or high resistance, depending on the absence or presence of muscular vessels. Computed tomographic imaging usually demonstrates a solitary mass lesion with well-defined margins with heterogeneous density on unenhanced CT and gradual enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT.9 The area of early enhancement within the mass corresponded to large vessels filled with blood, and the nonenhancing area corresponds to bundles of smooth muscle and fibrous tissue.Surgical resection is usually curative with rare recurrences.2 In selected cases, preoperative endovascular embolization has been performed as an adjunct to surgery to facilitate resection.10In this case, the preoperative workup, including abdominal ultrasonography, CT, endoscopic ultrasonography, and fine-needle aspiration, did not reveal a clear diagnosis. At surgery, the lesion was dissected from the head of the pancreas inferiorly, the portal vein laterally, lymph nodes within the porta hepatis posteriorly, and left portal vein superiorly prior to dividing the common hepatic artery proximal to the tumor and the origins of the left and right hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries distal to the tumor. The tumor was then freed from the remaining posterior attachments, and vascular reconstruction was performed.

4278,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/1829627,"A woman in her 50s was hospitalized for a painful anal mass. She had a history of hypertension and depression and was receiving omeprazole and paroxetine. The mass had appeared 2 days before presentation and was associated with vomiting. Additionally, the patient had not passed stools or had intestinal gas for 2 days. On physical examination, the mass was exteriorized through the anal canal. It was covered by hypoxemic rectal mucosa, but no digestive lumen could be identified inside the mass (Figure 1). Furthermore, the patient had a distended abdomen, absent bowel sounds, and no tenderness to palpation. No abdominal scar was visible, and no groin hernia was palpable. Her blood pressure was 160/80 mm Hg and her temperature was 37.8°C. Results of complete blood cell count, coagulation tests, and basic chemistry panel were all within normal limits. An abdominal radiograph showed several air-fluid levels without pneumoperitoneum, confirming an intestinal occlusion.View of the mass exteriorized through the anus. What Is the Diagnosis?",Hedrocele,Rectal prolapse,Anal neoplasm,External hemorrhoids,A. Hedrocele,A,Hedrocele,"With the patient under brief general anesthesia, the mass was reintroduced into the anus and, to prevent recurrence, an anal probe was placed in the rectum (Figure 2). After intestinal transit resumed, the patient underwent static pelvic floor magnetic resonance imaging, which confirmed the diagnosis of hedrocele (Figure 3). In view of these findings, the diagnosis of hedrocele complicated by an intestinal incarceration was made. The patient underwent an operation 6 days later. A laparoscopic rectopexy was performed, and the patient was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day. At 2-years’ follow-up, the patient is well, without recurrence of the hedrocele.View of the rectal probe after the mass was reintroduced into the anus.Pelvic magnetic resonance image showing the hedrocele (H) containing intestinal loops protruding into the rectum (R). B indicates bladder; P, pubis; U, uterus; and V, vagina. Hedrocele, derived from the Greek terms hedros, meaning anus, and kele, meaning hernia, literally means anal hernia. It represents an extremely rare form of hernia—only 2 case reports1,2 have been published in the medical literature. Like enterocele, hedrocele is a variant of the rare posterior perineal hernia, resulting from a defect in the rectovaginal septum.3 The herniation resulting from this defect can protrude anteriorly or posteriorly. In women, the hernias typically protrude in the posterior wall of the vagina and are termed enteroceles; in men they protrude posteriorly in the anterior wall of the rectum and are called hedroceles. This difference is due to the resistance of the prostate gland in men, which tends to favor posterior protrusion. However, hedrocele can occur in women, as illustrated in our case. It can be associated with enterocele or other perineal hernias. From a clinical point of view, hedrocele can cause different but nonspecific symptoms, such as dyschezia, constipation, and tenesmus. The natural history of hedrocele is to progress and protrude through the rectum and then through the anus. The main complication is intestinal incarceration and strangulation in the hernia. The differential diagnosis of hedrocele includes rectal polyps, rectal tumors, rectal prolapse, and hemorrhoids.

The patient denied any antecedent trauma or infection. Her medical history was significant for hypertension and left breast invasive ductal carcinoma in 2007 treated with lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation as well as synchronous rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and abdominoperineal resection. As part of her treatment course, the patient received a total dose of 50.5 Gy pelvic irradiation and 60 Gy irradiation to the left breast and axillary basin. The patient was followed up with yearly computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis in addition to yearly digital mammography. Her last mammogram, 5 months prior to presentation, was unremarkable. On physical examination, she had a hard, well-circumscribed, fixed mass in the upper, outer quadrant of her left breast. The lesion was not tender to palpation nor was there any associated axillary or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Examination of the nipple as well as the contralateral breast and axilla was unremarkable. Computed tomography of the thorax revealed a 6.7 × 4 cm mass arising from the left chest wall distinct from the left breast with extent to the pleural surface of the left thorax (Figure, A). Positron emission tomography revealed metabolic activity within the mass but did not reveal any distant disease.

Desmoid tumor of chest wall,B. Spindle cell sarcoma of the chest wall,B,B. Spindle cell sarcoma of the chest wall,"The patient underwent successful extirpation of the chest wall sarcoma. Intraoperative frozen section analysis revealed uninvolved radial margins. The parietal pleura displayed local fibrosis but was not invaded by the sarcoma. Final pathology confirmed the intraoperative findings and assigned a National Institutes of Health grade 2/3 to the lesion. The patient did not require additional adjuvant therapy and will be closely monitored for recurrence.Radiation therapy is an integral part of the accepted treatment protocols for many malignancies. Whole-breast irradiation in breast-conserving therapy and axillary irradiation are the standard of care in patients presenting with resectable malignancies of the breast. Postirradiation development of sarcoma is a rare but well-documented complication of radiotherapy for breast carcinoma. The risk of radiation-induced sarcoma (RIS) increases with latency time and the nature of the radiation field used. Modern fractionated radiation is associated with a decreased risk of RIS as compared with older unfractionated, transthoracic external beam radiation therapy. High-grade, eg, poorly differentiated, tumors are fast growing and associated with poor prognosis.1,2The clinical definition of RIS established in 1948 by Cahan et al3 remains practically unchanged to date. Patients are classified as having RIS if they have a history of radiation exposure prior to the development of sarcoma in or near the treatment field, with histological confirmation of a sarcoma that is unique from the primary cancer.2,3In patients undergoing radiation for breast carcinoma, the current reported incidence of RIS is 0.07% at 5 years, 0.27% at 10 years, and 0.48% at 15 years.4 The average latency for RIS is approximately 10 years. Although older case series suggest a higher incidence, these studies were in general small series and performed in the cobalt radiation era and without the benefit of dose fractionation. Longitudinal case series suggest that the survival rate for RIS treated with surgical resection is 40% at 5 years, with good outcomes for patients with low-grade tumors who undergo complete resection.5Chest wall tumors remain challenging to treat despite improvements in surgical technique. The surgeon must consider the factors of tumor size, location, previous radiation therapy, risk of infection, patient lifestyle, and prognosis when choosing a surgical approach.6 Patient outcomes for the excision of chest wall sarcoma are good, with published mortality rates less than 1%.7,8Wide resection is necessary to minimize local recurrence. The resultant tissue defect can be classified as either full thickness, involving the chest wall proper, or as a soft tissue defect alone. Large soft tissue defects can be reconstructed using skin grafts, local tissue transfer, pedicled myocutaneous flaps such as latissimus dorsi and rectus abdominus, or free flaps requiring microvascular anastomosis. Full-thickness defects with 2 or fewer resected ribs generally do not impair chest wall mechanics and do not require stabilization of the bony thorax.

The patient did not require additional adjuvant therapy and will be closely monitored for recurrence.Radiation therapy is an integral part of the accepted treatment protocols for many malignancies. Whole-breast irradiation in breast-conserving therapy and axillary irradiation are the standard of care in patients presenting with resectable malignancies of the breast. Postirradiation development of sarcoma is a rare but well-documented complication of radiotherapy for breast carcinoma. The risk of radiation-induced sarcoma (RIS) increases with latency time and the nature of the radiation field used. Modern fractionated radiation is associated with a decreased risk of RIS as compared with older unfractionated, transthoracic external beam radiation therapy. High-grade, eg, poorly differentiated, tumors are fast growing and associated with poor prognosis.1,2The clinical definition of RIS established in 1948 by Cahan et al3 remains practically unchanged to date. Patients are classified as having RIS if they have a history of radiation exposure prior to the development of sarcoma in or near the treatment field, with histological confirmation of a sarcoma that is unique from the primary cancer.2,3In patients undergoing radiation for breast carcinoma, the current reported incidence of RIS is 0.07% at 5 years, 0.27% at 10 years, and 0.48% at 15 years.4 The average latency for RIS is approximately 10 years. Although older case series suggest a higher incidence, these studies were in general small series and performed in the cobalt radiation era and without the benefit of dose fractionation. Longitudinal case series suggest that the survival rate for RIS treated with surgical resection is 40% at 5 years, with good outcomes for patients with low-grade tumors who undergo complete resection.5Chest wall tumors remain challenging to treat despite improvements in surgical technique. The surgeon must consider the factors of tumor size, location, previous radiation therapy, risk of infection, patient lifestyle, and prognosis when choosing a surgical approach.6 Patient outcomes for the excision of chest wall sarcoma are good, with published mortality rates less than 1%.7,8Wide resection is necessary to minimize local recurrence. The resultant tissue defect can be classified as either full thickness, involving the chest wall proper, or as a soft tissue defect alone. Large soft tissue defects can be reconstructed using skin grafts, local tissue transfer, pedicled myocutaneous flaps such as latissimus dorsi and rectus abdominus, or free flaps requiring microvascular anastomosis. Full-thickness defects with 2 or fewer resected ribs generally do not impair chest wall mechanics and do not require stabilization of the bony thorax.

Glucagonoma syndrome is characterized by weight loss, NME, new-onset diabetes, stomatitis, and diarrhea.2 Most patients are diagnosed as having metastatic disease at presentation.2 Surgical removal of the tumor is the only curative option. Complete resolution of NME after pancreatic resection was previously reported.3,4 Glucagonoma-associated skin manifestations other than NME (dermatitis, skin ulcerations) resolve after surgery as well.A rash with a new onset of glucose intolerance mandates a diagnostic workup for glucagonoma, a rare subtype of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. This tumor classically presents with the glucagon-induced syndrome. The skin rash encountered in patients diagnosed as having glucagonoma is typically NME, but physicians need to be aware that other types of dermatitis can result from the circulating high glucagon levels. These skin lesions do not share the same histopathological features as NME. Aggressive surgical approaches alongside treatment with somatostatin analogues remain the only curative treatment for glucagonomas with ensuing resolution of all skin manifestations.5",Surgery,"A 66-year-old patient presented with a skin rash on their lower limb. They has been unemployed and bedridden for the last 3 years owing to their skin disease. They has a history of ischemic heart disease, familial Mediterranean fever, and arthropathy. They was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain relief and steroids for the skin disease. Except for the skin rash, they was newly diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus. On presentation, they noted anorexia and reported a 10-kg weight loss during the last 8 months. On physical examination, they appeared cachectic. Their abdomen was soft with no palpable mass.

Calcific uremic arteriolopathy,C,Calcific uremic arteriolopathy,"Calcific uremic arteriolopathy, also known as calciphylaxis, is a rare disorder of unknown etiology characterized by medial calcification, intimal proliferation, and fibrosis of the walls of small subcutaneous vessels (Figure 2), which leads to thrombosis, ulceration, and necrosis of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, and, less often, the muscle. It occurs most commonly in patients with end-stage renal disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism with a mortality rate of 60%.1 It may rarely occur in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. The exact mechanism that leads to the deposition of calcium in the subcutaneous vessels is unknown. Factors that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of calcific uremic arteriolopathy include poorly controlled hyperphosphatemia, increased levels of calcium-phosphate product, increased serum parathyroid hormone levels, and low protein C and S levels.2Photomicrograph of punch biopsy of the skin from left posterior medial calf demonstrating epidermal necrosis, dermal hemorrhage, focal dermal intravascular thrombi, and subcutaneous intravascular (white arrowhead) and extravascular (black arrowhead) calcifications; there were no features of vasculitis (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×400).Our patient’s skin lesions progressed despite administration of a noncalcium phosphate binder (sevelamer) to reduce hyperphosphatemia and cinacalcet therapy to control the serum parathyroid hormone level.

In addition, the patient had worsening lower back and lower extremity pain, treated as sciatica on an outpatient basis, for 3 months. The patient had constipation, urinary incontinence, and generalized weakness but no fever, nausea or vomiting, or change in bowel movements. Physical examination revealed a firm, nonpulsatile, slightly tender mass in the left lower quadrant and significant perineal ecchymosis. Vital signs were normal. Laboratory test results were remarkable for white blood cell count (13 800/μL [to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001]), blood urea nitrogen level (72 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.357]), creatinine level (4.2 mg/dL [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]), hemoglobin level (9.8 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0]), and international normalized ratio (2.7).

A, Axial imaging shows that the bladder (black arrow) is displaced to the right, and a Foley catheter is located anteriorly. The rectum (white arrow) is compressed posteriorly.

Internal iliac artery aneurysm,D. Primary lymphoma of the urinary bladder,C. Internal iliac artery aneurysm,C,C. Internal iliac artery aneurysm,"In this case, preoperative axial and coronal imaging on abdominal and pelvic computed tomography demonstrated a massive left internal iliac artery aneurysm measuring 14 × 12 × 16 cm. Our patient was a very poor surgical candidate with an ejection fraction of approximately 10%. Palliation was considered, but ureteral stents to decompress the obstructed urinary system were not feasible. After stabilization and resuscitation of the patient, proximal ligation and obliterative endoaneurysmorrhaphy were performed. His renal function improved significantly after the operation, and the patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility on postoperative day 5.Isolated internal iliac artery aneurysms (IIAAs) are extremely rare and account for 0.03% to 0.4% of all intra-abdominal aneurysms. Most are unilateral and occur in 1.5% of all aortoiliac aneurysms. They affect men 6 times as often as women and present at a mean age of 71.2 years.1 Isolated IIAAs are difficult to diagnose because they are deep in the pelvis and often present late as a result of complications. Our patient had chronic lower back and left-sided hip pain radiating down his leg during the previous 3 months. This had been getting progressively worse and transformed into bilateral lower extremity pain, and he was unable to ambulate on presentation owing to the severity of the pain. He also had scrotal and perineal ecchymosis for approximately 5 days and worsening urinary incontinence for the past 4 days. He had no bowel movements for the past 6 days. These symptoms were most likely due to compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots, the genitourinary system, and the rectum. The aneurysm was not ruptured; rather, it was almost completely thrombosed. A large area of ecchymosis was noted in the retroperitoneum, representing an extension of a retroperitoneal hematoma from a leaking IIAA found in the operating room. Up to 70% of patients with IIAAs can present asymptomatically and are diagnosed coincidentally on imaging studies for other reasons.1During the patient’s infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair 7 years prior, multiple IAAs were found, including a 3-cm right common IAA, a 5-cm right IIAA, and a left IIAA measuring 8 cm. The surgical treatment included exclusion of the right common IAA, proximal ligation of the right IIAA, and proximal ligation of the left common iliac artery just proximal to the aneurysm. The right and left external iliac arteries were transected, the proximal ends were ligated, and a Dacron graft bypass connected the aorta to bilateral external iliac arteries. Our patient was found to have a recurrence of the left IIAA only after proximal ligation. Decreased bleeding and morbidity owing to minimal dissection are benefits of proximal ligation; however, the aneurysm is not decompressed and this technique carries a risk of recurrence up to 33% owing to retrograde refilling from the hypogastric branches. Rupture has also been reported in this group.2 During the initial surgery, the distal end of the left IIAA was difficult to visualize and impossible to access without significant bleeding. The decision for proximal ligation was made to decrease the time and morbidity of the already extensive surgery. Even with total inflow occlusion, an IIAA can expand and rupture from retrograde flow from collaterals. Limited data correlate risk of rupture with size of an IIAA, particularly one of this caliber; however, it is believed that the risk of rupture increases with size. Richardson and Greenfield3 showed the mean size of an isolated IIAA at diagnosis to be 7.7 cm with a 33% incidence of rupture (n = 12). The mean size of a ruptured isolated IIAA was 5.6 cm. The endovascular approach has shown satisfactory outcomes for treatment of isolated IIAA as well as decreased operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative hospital stay compared with the open approach.4,5 A disadvantage of this technique is the inability to reduce compression effects of large aneurysms, with maximum 2-cm shrinkage after endovascular repair.6 An endovascular approach in this patient would not have been feasible owing to the large size of the aneurysm with associated compression effects and his previous surgery, which included ligation of both the right and left common iliac arteries. The endoaneurysmorrhaphy was chosen to treat this recurrence to decompress the aneurysm and because oversewing the individual collateral vessels from within the aneurysm sac obliterates the risk of recurrence. This technique carries a 10% mortality rate3; however, the patient insisted on having his symptoms eliminated.",Surgery,"An 88-year-old man with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation while receiving warfarin sodium, congestive heart failure, extended right hemicolectomy for colon cancer, and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair visited the hospital with epigastric pain of 3 days’ duration.

He also had scrotal and perineal ecchymosis for approximately 5 days and worsening urinary incontinence for the past 4 days. He had no bowel movements for the past 6 days. These symptoms were most likely due to compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots, the genitourinary system, and the rectum.

In addition, a mycetoma usually moves when the patient changes position.5 Therefore, the classic CT scan workup of a mycetoma should include both supine and prone studies to demonstrate whether the central mass is free or attached to the cystic wall. Furthermore, the presence or absence of contrast enhancement within the mass on CT images may help differentiate between a mycetoma and other conditions such as malignancy or active infection.Cavitary neoplasms, tuberculosis, hydatid cysts (alveolar echinococcosis), and bacterial lung abscess may also give rise to an air crescent sign.2 Cavitation is a common radiologic presentation of lung cancer and more frequently found in squamous cell carcinoma. It is well known that the cancerous cavity often has a thick wall with an irregular inner surface.3 Part of the wall may project into the cavity, forming a so-called mural nodule. In contrast to a mycetoma, cavitary lung cancers rarely present with thin-walled cavities resembling cysts.3In conclusion, though the air crescent sign is most often associated with benign diseases such as mycetoma, physicians should consider it as a potential indicator of lung cancer.",Surgery,"A 62-year-old patient was admitted to our hospital with a concern of productive cough, profuse hemoptysis, and intermittent breathlessness for about 5 months. They had a 50-year history of cigarette smoking and had stopped smoking 5 months prior to being seen.When the symptom of hemoptysis occurred 5 months earlier, chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) revealed a ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe. The patient was treated with an antifibrinolytic agent (tranexamic acid), and the hemoptysis gradually improved and follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of the lesion (Figure 1). However, about 1 month later, hemoptysis reoccurred and increased volume and frequency over the following 4 months.After treatment with an antifibrinolytic agent, a ball-like mass with an air crescent sign in the left upper lobe was noted.On physical examination, sonorous rhonchi were audible in the bilateral lungs. Chest CT revealed a cavitary lesion with a central contrast-enhanced ball-like mass at the site of the prior ground-glass lesion. Sputum examinations for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, fungal culture, and cytology showed negative results. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed blood clots over the orifice of the left upper lobe bronchus, but no endobronchial lesion was detected.The chest CT finding, characteristic of a fungus ball-like shadow with an air crescent sign, highly suggested a pulmonary aspergilloma. However, the contrast enhancement was present within the mass, and lung malignancy could not be excluded. Because of persistent massive hemoptysis, the patient underwent left exploratory thoracotomy. A whitish, firm nodule about 2 cm was noted in a cavity in the left upper lung.",what is the diagnosis?,What is your diagnosis?,C. Squamous cell carcinoma,B. Pulmonary tuberculosis,A.

Type 1 choledochal cyst,C,Type 1 choledochal cyst,"Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed extrahepatic biliary tree dilation from the confluence of the hepatic ducts to the level of the intrapancreatic portion of the bile duct, consistent with a type 1 choledochal cyst. The intrahepatic ducts appeared normal. The patient underwent an operative exploration that confirmed the diagnosis (Figure 2A). The choledochal cyst was resected, and a 60-cm retrocolic Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was created for the biliary reconstruction. The resected specimen demonstrated no dysplastic changes (Figure 2B). The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on the sixth postoperative day.Gross views of cyst: intraoperative view of cystic extrahepatic biliary tree (A) and resected specimen revealing a stone in the sectioned cyst (B). C indicates type 1 choledochal cyst; D, duodenum; and G, gallbladder.Choledochal cysts, or bile duct cysts, are congenital dilatations of the biliary system that are most commonly found in women, East Asians, and children. In Western countries, the incidence ranges from 1 in 13 500 persons to 1 in 200 000 persons.1 Cysts are classically divided into 5 subtypes by the Todani modification of the Alonzo-Lej classification. A type 1a cyst consists of common bile duct (CBD) dilatation, a type 1b cyst has focal segmental dilation of the CBD, and a type 1c cyst has diffuse fusiform dilation of the CBD. Type 2 cysts are extrahepatic duct diverticula. Type 3 cysts are intraduodenal or intrapancreatic ductal dilations, also known as choledochoceles. Type 4a cysts are characterized by multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct cysts, whereas type 4b cysts consist of multiple extrahepatic duct cysts only. Finally, type 5 cysts, also known as Caroli disease, are single or multiple intrahepatic biliary cysts.2There are several theories regarding the pathogenesis of choledochal cysts. The most widely accepted is an abnormally high junction between the CBD and the pancreatic duct that creates a long, common channel allowing for pancreatic and biliary reflux into the CBD.3-5 In their retrospective review, Wang et al4 found anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal union in 93.8% of patients with choledochal cysts. A second theory suggests sphincter of Oddi dysfunction resulting in the reflux of bile and pancreatic juice with the subsequent cystic dilatation of the bile duct.6 Common to each model is prolonged biliary inflammation secondary to the reflux of pancreatic juice and bile stasis. This mechanism predisposes the patient to a spectrum of pathology ranging from choledocholithiasis to malignant transformation.1,2,4,5The incidence of carcinogenesis associated with choledochal cysts ranges from 2.5% to 26%.7 The risk of malignancy increases with age, with patients in their ninth decade of life having a 75% chance of malignant conversion. The most commonly associated tumor with choledochal cysts is cholangiocarcinoma, although other hepatopancreaticobiliary cancers have been described.7 Given the high lifetime risk of malignant conversion of choledochal cysts, surgical resection of the cyst is recommended.",Surgery,"A 30-year-old female immigrant from Laos was referred to our institution after admission to an outside hospital for right upper quadrant abdominal pain with associated nausea and vomiting.

In Western countries, the incidence ranges from 1 in 13 500 persons to 1 in 200 000 persons.1 Cysts are classically divided into 5 subtypes by the Todani modification of the Alonzo-Lej classification. A type 1a cyst consists of common bile duct (CBD) dilatation, a type 1b cyst has focal segmental dilation of the CBD, and a type 1c cyst has diffuse fusiform dilation of the CBD. Type 2 cysts are extrahepatic duct diverticula. Type 3 cysts are intraduodenal or intrapancreatic ductal dilations, also known as choledochoceles. Type 4a cysts are characterized by multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct cysts, whereas type 4b cysts consist of multiple extrahepatic duct cysts only. Finally, type 5 cysts, also known as Caroli disease, are single or multiple intrahepatic biliary cysts.2There are several theories regarding the pathogenesis of choledochal cysts. The most widely accepted is an abnormally high junction between the CBD and the pancreatic duct that creates a long, common channel allowing for pancreatic and biliary reflux into the CBD.3-5 In their retrospective review, Wang et al4 found anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal union in 93.8% of patients with choledochal cysts. A second theory suggests sphincter of Oddi dysfunction resulting in the reflux of bile and pancreatic juice with the subsequent cystic dilatation of the bile duct.6 Common to each model is prolonged biliary inflammation secondary to the reflux of pancreatic juice and bile stasis.

The patient was prepared medically for resection with 4 weeks of α-blockade with phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride and 4 days of metyrosine to decrease the catecholamine load. A thoracoabdominal incision and exposure were necessary to completely resect the mass en bloc with the left kidney, spleen, and distal pancreas because of the involvement of the tumor with the vasculature of these organs. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 13 after being weaned from the ventilator and vasopressor support. She received vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria secondary to the incidental splenectomy.Surgical pathology of the 5582-g mass, measuring 24 × 20 × 14 cm, revealed a pheochromocytoma with nodular architecture and multiple areas of vascular invasion.

As many as 57.6% of patients with pheochromocytoma may be completely asymptomatic.3 With the increased use of diagnostic imaging for a variety of pathologies, it is becoming more common for pheochromocytoma to be discovered incidentally. Of patients diagnosed with pheochromocytoma, between 20% and 41% were discovered unexpectedly on imaging for other issues.2 Between 5% and 10% of pheochromocytoma tumors are bilateral and up to 15% are extra-adrenal, referred to as catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas.The average age at the time of diagnosis is 47 years. Men and women are affected equally. The average tumor size at the time of diagnosis is 4.9 cm. Tumors less than 10 cm can often be safely resected laparoscopically. Larger tumors such as the one presented herein require an open approach. In this case, a thoracoabdominal incision was used to expose the mass and control the descending aorta.In summary, a pheochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine-secreting tumor. Traditionally, the symptoms associated with pheochromocytoma are episodic headache, sweating, tachycardia, and episodic hypertension, though these are not often present.

Men and women are affected equally. The average tumor size at the time of diagnosis is 4.9 cm. Tumors less than 10 cm can often be safely resected laparoscopically. Larger tumors such as the one presented herein require an open approach. In this case, a thoracoabdominal incision was used to expose the mass and control the descending aorta.In summary, a pheochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine-secreting tumor. Traditionally, the symptoms associated with pheochromocytoma are episodic headache, sweating, tachycardia, and episodic hypertension, though these are not often present.

Pheochromocytoma,B,Pheochromocytoma,"In this case, preoperative computed tomographic imaging of the abdomen revealed a 25 × 22 × 21-cm mixed cystic and solid mass centered within the left retroperitoneum. Because of the retroperitoneal location of the tumor, laboratory evaluation for pheochromocytoma was initiated. The patient had extremely elevated levels of urinary dopamine, plasma metanephrine, and plasma normetanephrine at 1972 µg/24 h (normal, <480 µg/24 h), 7268 pg/mL (normal, <1775 pg/mL), and 22 850 pg/mL (normal, <2548 pg/mL), respectively. The patient was prepared medically for resection with 4 weeks of α-blockade with phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride and 4 days of metyrosine to decrease the catecholamine load. A thoracoabdominal incision and exposure were necessary to completely resect the mass en bloc with the left kidney, spleen, and distal pancreas because of the involvement of the tumor with the vasculature of these organs. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 13 after being weaned from the ventilator and vasopressor support. She received vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria secondary to the incidental splenectomy.Surgical pathology of the 5582-g mass, measuring 24 × 20 × 14 cm, revealed a pheochromocytoma with nodular architecture and multiple areas of vascular invasion. Sheets of tumor cells were observed within the mass where it lost its nodularity. This tumor was classified as malignant because of its size and the extent of invasion, although the pathologic appearance of benign and malignant pheochromocytoma is often identical.Catecholamine-secreting tumors are rare, occurring in only 0.2% of patients with hypertension and 0.5% of patients with hypertension and symptoms suggesting pheochromocytoma.1 The traditional triad of episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia occurs in the minority of patients with pheochromocytoma.2 The most common presenting symptom is hypertension, though 5% to 15% of patients have normal blood pressure, like the patient presented herein.

An acute inflammatory reaction usually occurs after fecalith impaction within a diverticulum and can be complicated by the formation of an abscess, perforation, a gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pseudomyxoma peritonei, or the formation of an enterocutaneous fistula.3 Because congenital diverticula have the complete structure with all layers of the appendix, they are less susceptible to perforate.7 Another potential complication is appendiceal volvulus or torsion due to band adhesions to adjacent structures.3Owing to their similar clinical presentations, a differential diagnosis between diverticulitis of the appendix and acute appendicitis may be confusing. However, Lipton et al7 noted some consistent differences. The duration of symptoms and the time interval between admission and appendectomy is longer for patients with diverticulitis.7 In addition, patients with appendiceal diverticulitis are older, report previous lower quadrant pain episodes, have fewer gastrointestinal symptoms at presentation, and lack the typical downward progression of initial central abdominal pain moving to the right iliac fossa.7Importantly enough, the incidence of perforation in cases of diverticulitis seems to be 4 times greater than in cases of acute appendicitis.7 A delay in diagnosis and the absence of the muscular layer of the appendix are thought to be contributing factors.Imaging plays a major role in its diagnosis. Ultrasonography, which is usually the first-line imaging technique used to evaluate right lower quadrant pain, shows the diverticula as well-defined, hypoechoic, round or oval-shaped lesions abutting the muscular layer of the appendix.

What Is the Diagnosis?",Acute appendicitis with colon diverticula,Acute appendiceal diverticulitis,Appendiceal diverticulum,Appendiceal mucocele,B. Acute appendiceal diverticulitis,B,Acute appendiceal diverticulitis,"Acute appendiceal diverticulitis was suspected after viewing the ultrasonographic and computed tomographic images and was confirmed by surgical resection and pathology. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on postoperative day 5.Appendiceal diverticulum is an uncommon clinical entity that is found in 0.2% to 1.5% of surgical pathologic specimens.1 Diverticula of the vermiform appendix can be congenital (localized in the antimesenteric border and characteristically covered by all layers of the appendix), but, more frequently, it is acquired (in the mesenteric border and lacking the muscularis mucosa), singly or multiply, and can occur along the entire length of the appendix.2 Both types are reported to be more common in males.3Although congenital diverticula pathogenesis remains uncertain (ie, only explained by developmental and genetic abnormalities),4 several mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of acquired appendicular diverticula: (1) increased intraluminal pressure caused by increased muscular activity,5 (2) obstruction of the appendicular lumen, and (3) weak points in the appendicular wall.5,6 Diverticula significantly alter the anatomy of the appendix and increase the possibility of infection.7 Noninflamed diverticula are not thought to be responsible for any symptoms, although they are subject to the same complications as colonic diverticula. An acute inflammatory reaction usually occurs after fecalith impaction within a diverticulum and can be complicated by the formation of an abscess, perforation, a gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pseudomyxoma peritonei, or the formation of an enterocutaneous fistula.3 Because congenital diverticula have the complete structure with all layers of the appendix, they are less susceptible to perforate.7 Another potential complication is appendiceal volvulus or torsion due to band adhesions to adjacent structures.3Owing to their similar clinical presentations, a differential diagnosis between diverticulitis of the appendix and acute appendicitis may be confusing. However, Lipton et al7 noted some consistent differences. The duration of symptoms and the time interval between admission and appendectomy is longer for patients with diverticulitis.7 In addition, patients with appendiceal diverticulitis are older, report previous lower quadrant pain episodes, have fewer gastrointestinal symptoms at presentation, and lack the typical downward progression of initial central abdominal pain moving to the right iliac fossa.7Importantly enough, the incidence of perforation in cases of diverticulitis seems to be 4 times greater than in cases of acute appendicitis.7 A delay in diagnosis and the absence of the muscular layer of the appendix are thought to be contributing factors.Imaging plays a major role in its diagnosis. Ultrasonography, which is usually the first-line imaging technique used to evaluate right lower quadrant pain, shows the diverticula as well-defined, hypoechoic, round or oval-shaped lesions abutting the muscular layer of the appendix. Ultrasonography is an operator-dependent technique and may be inconclusive in some cases; the inflammatory changes surrounding the appendix, together with the possible reactive inflammation of the appendix itself, may lead to a misdiagnosis of acute appendicitis. In this setting, most cases of appendiceal diverticulitis can be differentiated from usual cases of acute appendicitis during computed tomography by visualization of the inflamed diverticulum.Diagnostic testing of an appendicular diverticulum is important, even for asymptomatic patients, because diverticulitis of the appendix may occur in up to two-thirds of affected patients,8 and a significant proportion of those will have a perforated diverticulum. That is the reason why D’Amico9 recommends that these patients undergo a prophylactic appendectomy.",Surgery,"A 50-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of right lower quadrant pain that did not migrate during that period of time.

Because gallbladder volvulus is associated with a necrotic gallbladder, it should be treated emergently with surgery with no role for expectant or conservative management, even in elderly patients or those with multiple medical comorbidities. Gallbladder volvulus is traditionally associated with elderly women, with a 3:1 female to male ratio.

Previous computed tomographic scans had shown multiple large gallstones that were no longer present. There is an intimate association of the gallbladder fundus with the adjacent hepatic flexure of the colon, with a loss of a defined plane between the 2 structures.In the operation room, the gallbladder was taken down in a “dome-down” fashion, and a segment of transverse colon, which included her previous ileocolonic anastomosis from a right-sided hemicolectomy, was excised. Figure 2 shows the resected gross specimen that visually illustrates the presence of a patent fistula that communicates from the fundus of the gallbladder to the colon, as well as the normal ileal and colonic mucosa. Inside the gallbladder lumen, there was a single 1.5 × 1.5-cm gallstone that was the etiology of the fistula.This case illustrates a patient that had developed a cholecystocolonic fistula, a rare complication of cholelithiasis that has a prevalence of about 2% of all biliary tree diseases.1 The patient had a significant medical history that had her on an immunosuppressive regime of chemotherapy and steroids that made her chronically leukopenic and thrombocytopenic. The blood culture that was positive for the bacterium Esakazakii, which is common to the gastrointestinal tract, was the beginning of our search for the source. On a taxonomical note, it is now recognized that E sakazakii actually belongs to the genus Cronobacter.In addition to being susceptible to infections, the patient had long-standing chronic diarrhea that was treated symptomatically. Chronic diarrhea has been reported to be a more specific symptom of cholecystocolonic fistula.2 The mechanism being the aberrant connection alters the normal enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, leading to an increase in bile acid concentration within the colon. These bile acids stimulate the colonic mucosa, leading to the secretion of water and electrolytes with a resultant watery diarrhea.3 In the case of our patient, her diarrhea was markedly worse with the fistula and has since stabilized with transient episodes following chemotherapy treatment.Cholecystocolonic fistulas are the second most common cholecystoenteric fistula after the far more common cholecystoduodenal fistula. Long-standing cholelithiasis is a risk factor for the development of fistulas, as was evident in this patient. Cholelithiasis induces a chronic inflammatory process that, over time, will lead to mechanical erosion through the gallbladder wall and into the wall of the adjacent colon or duodenum. This is a result of the close anatomical proximity of these structures. In the overwhelming majority of cases, this happens between the gallbladder and the duodenum and can lead to a gallstone ileus, whereby a stone becomes lodged at the ileocecal valve.Cholecystocolonic fistulas are so rare that most physicians do not maintain a high index of suspicion for them in clinical cases. This is made even more difficult when you have patients with other comorbidities. Chronic diarrhea in a patient who is receiving chemotherapy is often attributed to the adverse effects of chemotherapy. Often, cholecystocolonic fistulas are not found until the surgeon is actually inside the abdomen, which can lead to the conversion from a laparoscopic to an open surgery, and thus a much more difficult operation than anticipated.

Significant laboratory data included a white blood cell count of 2700/μL (reference range, 4800-10 800/μL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), a lactic acid level of 19.8 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111), and a platelet count of 72×103/μL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 1.0).

A urine culture came back positive for Klebsiella pneumonia, and a blood culture came back positive for Enterobacter sakazakii (now know as Cronobacter sakazakii). There was concern about the source of the bacteremia, so an infectious disease consult was ordered, and a computed tomographic scan of the abdomen/pelvis with contrast was performed. Figure 1 shows a coronal, reformatted image of the scan. The patient was scheduled for surgery, and the findings are shown in Figure 2.

Cholecystocolonic fistula,C,Cholecystocolonic fistula,"The computed tomographic scan shows marked inflammatory changes involving the gallbladder with air within the lumen (Figure 2). Previous computed tomographic scans had shown multiple large gallstones that were no longer present. There is an intimate association of the gallbladder fundus with the adjacent hepatic flexure of the colon, with a loss of a defined plane between the 2 structures.In the operation room, the gallbladder was taken down in a “dome-down” fashion, and a segment of transverse colon, which included her previous ileocolonic anastomosis from a right-sided hemicolectomy, was excised. Figure 2 shows the resected gross specimen that visually illustrates the presence of a patent fistula that communicates from the fundus of the gallbladder to the colon, as well as the normal ileal and colonic mucosa. Inside the gallbladder lumen, there was a single 1.5 × 1.5-cm gallstone that was the etiology of the fistula.This case illustrates a patient that had developed a cholecystocolonic fistula, a rare complication of cholelithiasis that has a prevalence of about 2% of all biliary tree diseases.1 The patient had a significant medical history that had her on an immunosuppressive regime of chemotherapy and steroids that made her chronically leukopenic and thrombocytopenic. The blood culture that was positive for the bacterium Esakazakii, which is common to the gastrointestinal tract, was the beginning of our search for the source. On a taxonomical note, it is now recognized that E sakazakii actually belongs to the genus Cronobacter.In addition to being susceptible to infections, the patient had long-standing chronic diarrhea that was treated symptomatically. Chronic diarrhea has been reported to be a more specific symptom of cholecystocolonic fistula.2 The mechanism being the aberrant connection alters the normal enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, leading to an increase in bile acid concentration within the colon. These bile acids stimulate the colonic mucosa, leading to the secretion of water and electrolytes with a resultant watery diarrhea.3 In the case of our patient, her diarrhea was markedly worse with the fistula and has since stabilized with transient episodes following chemotherapy treatment.Cholecystocolonic fistulas are the second most common cholecystoenteric fistula after the far more common cholecystoduodenal fistula. Long-standing cholelithiasis is a risk factor for the development of fistulas, as was evident in this patient. Cholelithiasis induces a chronic inflammatory process that, over time, will lead to mechanical erosion through the gallbladder wall and into the wall of the adjacent colon or duodenum. This is a result of the close anatomical proximity of these structures. In the overwhelming majority of cases, this happens between the gallbladder and the duodenum and can lead to a gallstone ileus, whereby a stone becomes lodged at the ileocecal valve.Cholecystocolonic fistulas are so rare that most physicians do not maintain a high index of suspicion for them in clinical cases. This is made even more difficult when you have patients with other comorbidities. Chronic diarrhea in a patient who is receiving chemotherapy is often attributed to the adverse effects of chemotherapy. Often, cholecystocolonic fistulas are not found until the surgeon is actually inside the abdomen, which can lead to the conversion from a laparoscopic to an open surgery, and thus a much more difficult operation than anticipated. This can be alleviated by physicians maintaining a high index of suspicion for cholecystocolonic fistulas in elderly women with chronic diarrhea who still have a gallbladder.",Surgery,"A 64-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with a 1-day temperature of 38.9°C (102°F).

Hepatic abscess,C,Hepatic abscess,"In this case of group C streptococci–related liver abscess following pharyngitis and scarlet fever, the radiological features were not typical of a simple cyst or of a biliary cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma, given the multiloculated aspect and the absence of contrast enhancement in the septa. The probability of a diagnosis of hydatid cyst was low owing to the patient’s history and the absence of calcifications. Therefore, being suspicious of an infectious etiology, we decided to perform an ultrasonography-guided diagnostic puncture of the hepatic lesion, which yielded a purulent fluid. A percutaneous drain was positioned. A fluid sample was sent to the laboratory for both microbiological and cytological examinations and evidenced necrotic debris in which β-hemolytic group C Streptococcus was isolated. Levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) was administered based on the antibiogram, which also showed that the strain of Streptococcus was resistant to clarithromycin. No primary abdominal infectious foci were apparent on the radiological images. A diagnostic workup was completed with a colonoscopy and an echocardiography, the results of which were negative. Positron emission computed tomography revealed, in addition to an intense enhancement in the liver abscess, a hypermetabolic lymph node located in the anterior mandibular region, ostensibly an issue of the previous pharyngitis. The patient’s course was favorable, and he was discharged from the hospital on day 14, after the removal of the percutaneous drain.Liver abscess is a rare condition with an incidence of 13 to 20 cases per 100 000 population per year.1 Abscesses are more often of a biliary or portal origin. Arterial bacteremia, traumatic injury, and the spread of the abscess by contiguity are more unusual causes. Ten percent to 30% of abscesses are idiopathic. A fever and upper right abdominal pain are the most common symptoms. Jaundice is observed in 25% to 30% of the patients. Aerobic gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria are the most common types of bacteria isolated, accounting for 40% to 60% cases and 40% to 50% of cases, respectively.2 Aerobic gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, α- and β-hemolytic streptococci, and group D streptococci) are isolated in 10% to 20% cases.3 The treatment consists of percutaneous drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, which is adapted according to the antibiogram of the isolates. Surgery is rarely indicated in the case of failure of the percutaneous drain.Scarlet fever is a common pediatric disease, and it is usually caused by pyrogenic toxin-producing group A streptococci. In most cases, it is consequent to an upper respiratory tract infection (“strep throat”). The prognosis is usually good after a timely diagnosis and proper antibiotic therapy, which is effective in reducing the incidence of scarlet fever’s most feared complications (ie, rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis).4 Other complications include osteomyelitis, arthritis, otitis media, hepatitis, meningitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis.5,6β-Hemolytic streptococci of a group other than A and B are known to cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including abscesses,7 more frequently in elderly and immunocompromised patients, but invasive infections are also observed in immunocompetent individuals.8 Occasionally, scarlet fever can be caused by β-hemolytic group C streptococci,9 whose resistance to macrolides in patients with an invasive infection has been previously described.10To the best of our knowledge, a liver abscess caused by group C streptococci following scarlet fever has never been reported. Even if the pharyngeal origin of the Streptococcus could not be formally demonstrated, the pathogenetic link between the previous pharyngitis and the liver abscess in our case is established by the fact that scarlet fever is an exotoxin-mediated disease arising from β-hemolytic streptococcal infection. In this instance, the abscess was most likely the consequence of a transient group C streptococcal bacteremia. Our young patient had no detectable immunodeficiency, which is noteworthy because it stresses that, even in immunocompetent individuals, this pathology should be considered. Finally, the case report once more highlights the paramount importance of obtaining liver abscess fluid cultures in order to search for ongoing or previous infectious foci and to administer the appropriate antibiotics.",Surgery,"A 26-year-old man was admitted to our institution for a fever (temperature, 39°C) and abdominal pain on the right side of his hypochondrium.

The prognosis is usually good after a timely diagnosis and proper antibiotic therapy, which is effective in reducing the incidence of scarlet fever’s most feared complications (ie, rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis).4 Other complications include osteomyelitis, arthritis, otitis media, hepatitis, meningitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis.5,6β-Hemolytic streptococci of a group other than A and B are known to cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including abscesses,7 more frequently in elderly and immunocompromised patients, but invasive infections are also observed in immunocompetent individuals.8 Occasionally, scarlet fever can be caused by β-hemolytic group C streptococci,9 whose resistance to macrolides in patients with an invasive infection has been previously described.10To the best of our knowledge, a liver abscess caused by group C streptococci following scarlet fever has never been reported. Even if the pharyngeal origin of the Streptococcus could not be formally demonstrated, the pathogenetic link between the previous pharyngitis and the liver abscess in our case is established by the fact that scarlet fever is an exotoxin-mediated disease arising from β-hemolytic streptococcal infection. In this instance, the abscess was most likely the consequence of a transient group C streptococcal bacteremia. Our young patient had no detectable immunodeficiency, which is noteworthy because it stresses that, even in immunocompetent individuals, this pathology should be considered.

What Is the Diagnosis?",Hydatid cyst,Infected biliary cystadenoma,Hepatic abscess,Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver,C. Hepatic abscess,C,Hepatic abscess,"In this case of group C streptococci–related liver abscess following pharyngitis and scarlet fever, the radiological features were not typical of a simple cyst or of a biliary cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma, given the multiloculated aspect and the absence of contrast enhancement in the septa. The probability of a diagnosis of hydatid cyst was low owing to the patient’s history and the absence of calcifications. Therefore, being suspicious of an infectious etiology, we decided to perform an ultrasonography-guided diagnostic puncture of the hepatic lesion, which yielded a purulent fluid. A percutaneous drain was positioned. A fluid sample was sent to the laboratory for both microbiological and cytological examinations and evidenced necrotic debris in which β-hemolytic group C Streptococcus was isolated. Levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) was administered based on the antibiogram, which also showed that the strain of Streptococcus was resistant to clarithromycin. No primary abdominal infectious foci were apparent on the radiological images. A diagnostic workup was completed with a colonoscopy and an echocardiography, the results of which were negative. Positron emission computed tomography revealed, in addition to an intense enhancement in the liver abscess, a hypermetabolic lymph node located in the anterior mandibular region, ostensibly an issue of the previous pharyngitis. The patient’s course was favorable, and he was discharged from the hospital on day 14, after the removal of the percutaneous drain.Liver abscess is a rare condition with an incidence of 13 to 20 cases per 100 000 population per year.1 Abscesses are more often of a biliary or portal origin. Arterial bacteremia, traumatic injury, and the spread of the abscess by contiguity are more unusual causes. Ten percent to 30% of abscesses are idiopathic. A fever and upper right abdominal pain are the most common symptoms. Jaundice is observed in 25% to 30% of the patients. Aerobic gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria are the most common types of bacteria isolated, accounting for 40% to 60% cases and 40% to 50% of cases, respectively.2 Aerobic gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, α- and β-hemolytic streptococci, and group D streptococci) are isolated in 10% to 20% cases.3 The treatment consists of percutaneous drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, which is adapted according to the antibiogram of the isolates.

Carbon 11–labeled methionine positron emission tomography/computed tomography detected a lesion in the neck suspicious for parathyroid adenoma (Figure 2), which was removed subsequently with minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Histopathological analysis showed a typical, 2.5-cm, large upper parathyroid adenoma. Postoperative management included calcium and vitamin D supplementation. At the 12-month follow-up, another radiograph of the right femur and tibia showed significant recalcifications.Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a single-gland parathyroid adenoma in about 90% of patients. Typical symptoms of pHPT are fatigue, weakness, poor concentration, depression, abdominal pain, kidney stones, hypertension, and osteoporosis. Our patient did not mention any of these symptoms.Elevated serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels can indicate pHPT. Indeed, elevated parathyroid hormone levels increase osteoclastic activity in the bone, which induces osteoporosis or in more severe cases, multiple cystic lesions (osteitis fibrosa cystica) or even pathological fractures. An increased osteoclastic activity causes bone resorption with fibrous replacement and giant cells.1 Predominant sites at which brown tumors develop are the jaw, clavicle, ribs, spine, pelvis, and femur.In Europe and the United States, the incidence of brown tumors has now become very low because of calcium screening.2 The clinical picture of pHPT in India, however, often includes skeletal and renal manifestations especially in young patients.3Radiological findings are nonspecific, often seen as multiple cystic lesions on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Lesions extending into the soft tissue, as seen in our patient in the tibia, may suggest malignant bone tumors.4 Since the lesions show an increased uptake on bone scintigraphy, technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scintigraphy, or flourodeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography/computed tomography, they might be falsely diagnosed as bone metastases.5Especially in young patients with HPT, familial HPT, patients with parathyroid carcinoma, or patients with cemento-ossifying fibromas of the mandible and maxilla, a mutation analysis for HRTP2/CDC73 should be considered to identify patients with an autosomal dominant HPT–jaw tumor syndrome.6Treatment of brown tumor depends on successful parathyroidectomy.
