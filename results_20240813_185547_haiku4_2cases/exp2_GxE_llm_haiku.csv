Maximum intensity projection image (Figure 1A) showed heterogeneous uptake of 18F-FDG in the skin of the visualized body. There was a distinctive visualization of almost the entire facial contour of the patient secondary to inflammation of the facial skin and the mucosa of the conjunctiva, nasal cavity, lips, and oral cavity (Figure 1B). 18F-FDG uptake was also noticed along the mucosa of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The mesenteric mass showed low-intensity 18F-FDG uptake. The patient started taking corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide-based prephase chemotherapy due to poor general condition.

What Is Your Diagnosis?",Lymphoma with cutaneous involvement,Drug-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome,Paraneoplastic pemphigus,Spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome,C. Paraneoplastic pemphigus,C,Paraneoplastic pemphigus,"The most plausible diagnosis is paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP). PNP can be a paraneoplastic manifestation of several different neoplastic disorders. However, hematolymphoid malignant neoplasms are the most frequently associated primary conditions in adults, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common.1 The case presented was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma (Figure 2). The mucocutaneous manifestations of PNP are insidious in onset differentiating it from the more rapid onset expected in drug-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and the cutaneous variant of tumor lysis syndrome. Primary cutaneous involvement by lymphoma typically presents as a clinical spectrum ranging from patches or plaques to tumor stage accompanied by various systemic symptoms.Axial fused positron emission tomography–computed tomography image with the mesenteric lymphoma mass marked by arrowhead.PNP is an autoimmune condition, and there is a growing consensus that affliction of several other organ systems is not uncommon even though skin involvement is the most notable feature of this condition. Hence the term paraneoplastic multiorgan syndrome has been suggested as an alternative. The high mortality rate associated with the condition may more plausibly be explained by multiorgan dysfunction. Although it is more common for the underlying malignant neoplasm to be detected before PNP, the skin rash may precede the detection of malignant neoplasm, especially if the latter is of indolent nature (eg, low-grade lymphoma). Ohzono et al2 reported in a series of 104 patients with PNP that 12 cases had no detectable tumor.Immune dysregulation, affecting both humoral and cell-mediated immunity, is hypothesized as the pathophysiological mechanism behind PNP. Overactive humoral immunity with the formation of autoantibodies to several epithelial antigens, primarily the desmoplakins and anchor proteins responsible for epidermal cell adhesion, is reported in such cases.3 Presence of autoantibodies to periplakin and envoplakin is proposed as a specific laboratory marker.4 The underlying malignant neoplasm may induce immune dysregulation through cross-reactivity of antibodies against tumor antigens and epithelial antigens.5 Further, accumulation of cluster of differentiation 8+ T lymphocytes and natural killer cells have been reported at the dermal-epidermal junction in PNP cases.6Besides polymorphic skin lesions, mucositis is characteristic of PNP. Oral mucosa is most frequently affected3 and is the initial site of presentation in about 50% of patients,6 as also in the presented case. Mucosal involvement of conjunctiva, nasopharynx, esophagus, gastrointestinal tract, and anogenital region may also be present.7 Skin rash typically follows the manifestations of mucosal involvement and shows considerable variation in the type of lesions and extent of involvement. Papulosquamous, targetoid, or vesiculobullous lesions may occur in isolation, or 1 type may predominate the others in a mixed pattern. Extensive cutaneous desquamation similar to toxic epidermal necrolysis may also occur, as in the presented case.3,8 Patients may develop involvement of respiratory epithelium with small airway predisposition leading to bronchiolitis. Immunological reactions targeting plakin proteins in small airway epithelium is the proposed mechanism.9 Bronchiolitis obliterans is a late and possibly life-threatening complication.The presented case also highlights the role of whole-body imaging like 18F-FDG PET-CT in evaluating cases presenting with similar clinical profiles and in narrowing down the differential diagnoses. 18F-FDG PET-CT may accurately map the disease activity in paraneoplastic inflammatory skin conditions and localize the primary cancers.The treatment of the underlying neoplasm is not strongly associated with remission of PNP. Instead, the latter is more likely to have a progressive course despite control of the malignant neoplasm.10 Systemic therapy with glucocorticoids, alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents like mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, rituximab, or intravenous immunoglobulin has been described to be effective, but the evidence is limited to case reports.
