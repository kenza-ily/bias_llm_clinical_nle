      "A man in his 30s with AIDS presented with acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). The patient also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to his significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection. For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed by scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and scraping its base with a #15 blade. These contents were placed on a glass slide, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa and subsequently Papanicolaou staining to further characterize the changes seen.A, Clinical image demonstrating papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the elbows.

      "An 80-year-old man with stage II bladder carcinoma (T2NXM0) and atrial fibrillation treated with apixaban presented to the emergency department with 1 week of fatigue and 2 days of dyspnea on exertion. One week prior to presentation, he received a fourth cycle of carboplatin/gemcitabine for bladder carcinoma with 6 mg of pegylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The patient reported no anorexia, fever, melena, hematemesis, hematuria, cough, orthopnea, or peripheral edema.His vital signs were normal except for a heart rate of 103/min. His white blood cell count was 22 × 103/μL (reference, 4-11 × 103/μL), increased from 4.8 × 103/μL 8 days prior. His manual differential, which was previously normal, showed 18% bands (0%-10%), 2% metamyelocytes, 7% myelocytes, 7% promyelocytes, and 6% blasts. His hemoglobin level was 5.2 g/dL (reference, 13-17 g/dL), decreased from 7.4 g/dL, and platelets were 25 × 103/μL (reference, 150-420 × 103/μL), decreased from 268 × 103/μL 8 days prior. Ferritin was 1423 ng/mL (reference, 300-400 ng/mL). Mean corpuscular volume, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, vitamin B12, and methylmalonic acid values were normal, and results of a direct antiglobulin test were negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his abdomen and pelvis was normal. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells and was admitted to the hospital. Flow cytometry identified a small population of CD34+/CD117+ cells (Figure).Left, Peripheral blood smear showing normocytic anemia with anisopoikilocytosis and leukocytosis with 6% to 8% blast forms.

      "A 68-year-old man presented with progressive right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches. His symptoms began 5 years earlier with right temple numbness, which expanded to include the entire right face and mouth. He then developed progressive right facial weakness with a droop, slurred speech, and eyelid ptosis. Finally, binocular vertical and horizontal diplopia and periorbital headaches began. Trials of gabapentin and steroids provided no relief. His history was significant for a left cheek melanoma completely excised years prior, numerous cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck removed without issue, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. His medications included metformin and simvastatin; he had no history of smoking or drinking.On examination, he had right-sided ptosis and severe right facial weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern with temporal wasting. The right pupil was fixed and dilated. There was no afferent pupillary defect. The left pupil was appropriately sized and reactive. His right-sided vision was impaired (20/250) with blurriness. Vertical and horizontal binocular diplopia was present. Right extraocular movements were significantly limited in all directions and painful, and right-sided facial sensation was diminished to pinprick in all cranial nerve (CN) V distributions. His speech was slightly slurred. Left-sided extraocular movements were intact. His left facial sensation was intact to pinprick, and his strength was without deficit. There were no other neurological abnormalities.Initial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were unremarkable. A biopsy of CN VII was nondiagnostic. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.8%. Tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed mildly elevated protein values.

      "A 31-year-old man presented with left cervical and left inguinal masses. He reported intermittent itching and night sweats for 2 years. He denied fever, weight loss, shortness of breath, rashes, diarrhea, and neurological symptoms. On a preemployment evaluation, the patient was told he had a high white blood cell count 2 years ago. On examination, there was left cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other organomegaly. Complete blood cell count and peripheral blood smear showed marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22 340/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 5360/μL, and 55% eosinophils with an absolute eosinophil count of 12 290/μL (to convert all to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Vitamin B12 was markedly elevated at more than 4000 pg/mL (to convert to pmol/L, multiply by 0.7378). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/h. Lactate dehydrogenase was 180 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 81 U/L (to convert both to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Evaluations for HIV and hepatitis B and C were all negative. Serum creatinine was 0.76 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4); alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 11 U/L and 9.9 U/L, respectively (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104). Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow (cellularity of 100%), myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%. Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan showed a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7 (Figure, A). Left inguinal lymph node biopsy showed partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT, suggestive of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (Figure, B).A, Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic (PET/CT) scan of the head and neck at presentation showing a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm (arrowhead).

      "A 28-year-old woman presented with a 5-day history of painful cervical lymphadenopathy along with fever, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids was started, without improvement of symptoms. She denied recent travel, sick contacts, or autoimmune disease. Her medical history was significant for α-thalassemia but otherwise noncontributory.On examination, she had tender lymphadenopathy involving right level V. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed a collection of enlarged, matted nodes without evidence of an abscess. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed nondiagnostic reactive lymph nodes. She was subsequently admitted to the hospital, where the lymphadenopathy progressed to the left side of the neck and a skin eruption developed over her face, back, and trunk. Results of an infectious disease and rheumatological workup, including bone marrow biopsy, were negative. Given her persistent symptoms, the ear, nose, and throat service consulted for excisional biopsy.On pathologic examination, the lymph nodes showed extensive coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris (Figure 1). Cellular components included histiocytes and dendritic cells, with absent neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies.Well-defined areas of fibrinoid necrosis in paracortical areas (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×20).

      "Case: A man in his 30s with AIDS presented with acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). The patient also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to his significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection. For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed by scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and scraping its base with a #15 blade. These contents were placed on a glass slide, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa and subsequently Papanicolaou staining to further characterize the changes seen.A, Clinical image demonstrating papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the elbows. B, Tzanck smear using Wright-Giemsa staining of specimen demonstrating ballooning of keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material (original magnification ×20).\n",

      "The case is: A 60-year-old Black patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion, 3 months of toe numbness, and unintended weight loss of 8 kg over 6 months. The patient also had a history of lumbar spinal stenosis. On presentation, blood pressure was 104/73 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed edema to the mid-calf bilaterally, hypoesthesia below the knees, and ankle plantar flexion strength of 3 of 5 based on the Medical Research Council Scale for muscle strength. Laboratory testing revealed a high-sensitivity troponin level of 52 ng/L (reference, <34 ng/L); brain-type natriuretic peptide, 112 pmol/L (reference, <30 pmol/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L) (reference, 0-35 U/L [0-0.58 μkat/L]); and alanine aminotransferase, 76 U/L (1.27 μkat/L) (reference, 0-45 U/L [0-0.75 μkat/L]). A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly without pulmonary vascular redistribution or pulmonary edema.An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, left anterior fascicular block, and down-sloping anterolateral ST segments. The patient was admitted to the hospital, where electromyography results included reduced amplitude of peroneal nerve action potentials, consistent with axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities. Coronary angiography showed no coronary atherosclerosis, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Results of serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum free light chain testing were normal. A bone scintigraphy scan using technetium Tc 99m–labeled hydroxymethylene diphosphonate demonstrated increased cardiac uptake (Figure).Anterior (left) and posterior (right) bone scintigraphy scan of the patient.\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their mid-30s with a medical history of deceased donor kidney transplant, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, and CMV viremia with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir (UL97 and UL54 gene mutations) presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes. The patient was taking systemic immunosuppression but recently stopped taking maribavir because of concerns about resistance and was transitioned to cidofovir and CMV immune globulin. On clinical examination, the visual acuity measured 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed tortuous vasculature, multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades and periphery, and granular, hypopigmented retinal lesions without hemorrhage in the macula and temporal periphery in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography showed localized areas of full-thickness retinitis (Figure 1B). CMV titers indicated viremia at 2.24 million IU/mL. Despite the patient’s documented UL97 and UL54 mutations, a series of 5 biweekly intravitreal injections of foscarnet and ganciclovir were performed given their vision-threatening lesions. Retinal pathology failed to improve, and the patient eventually refused additional intravitreal therapy because of pain and transiently decreased vision after each injection.Ultra-widefield fundus photograph and optical coherence tomography of a necrotic retinal lesion in the right eye demonstrating (A) multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades with retinal lesions in the temporal periphery (arrowheads) and (B) a cross-section through a temporal lesion along the superior arcade showing full thickness retinitis (arrow).Observation with systemic cidofovir and CMV immune globulin\n",

      "The case is: A 25-month-old child with unilateral hearing loss was referred to a pediatric ear, nose, and throat surgeon in a secondary care hospital. Clinical findings suggested unilateral right middle ear effusion associated with ipsilateral conductive hearing loss. After an initial observation period, a right tympanostomy tube was inserted. During the procedure, a clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear was noted, and samples were sent for β-2-transferrine analysis. This confirmed the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak.The patient was referred to our tertiary referral center hospital. The leak settled with conservative management, and imaging of the brain and skull base was performed. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone showed a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule (Figure 1A). There was soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull base with contrast was performed (Figure 1B). It showed a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. There was a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed signs of Chiari malformation type 1. After a skull base multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a bone biopsy through a transmastoid approach.A, Axial high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bones at the level of the basal turn of the cochlea showed osteolysis involving the petrous part of the right temporal bone. There was associated soft tissue partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells. The destructive process did not involve the otic capsule. B, Coronal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and skull base, T2-weighted images showed a hypersignal in the right mastoid and middle ear with suspected communication through the tegmen. There was also a hypersignal in the soft tissues of the right neck in keeping with extravasation of cerebrospinal fluid in cervical lymphatics.\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their mid-60s was referred for evaluation of a left iris pigmented lesion. The mass had been present for decades and multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists, most recently 4 years prior, showed the mass remained stable in size.The patient’s ocular history included cataract extraction with intraocular lens placement and retinal tear of the right eye and cataract of the left eye. Review of systems was negative for any recent changes in health, weight loss, fever, or night sweats. Visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/25+ OS. Intraocular pressures were normal.Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, and the left eye had a raised pigmented iris lesion without prominent internal vasculature and with mammillations on the surface (multiple small smooth dome-shaped protuberances on the surface of the tumor). There were large pigment granules on the surface of the tumor and on the adjacent iris surrounding the mass (Figure 1A). There was no ectropion uvea or iris neovascularization. There were mild nuclear sclerotic changes across the lens in the left eye. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a homogeneous intrinsic iris solid tumor with a height of 1.4 mm and basal diameter of 4.1 mm, without angle or ciliary body involvement (Figure 1B).Color slitlamp photograph shows a pigmented iris mass (note both the mammillations [black arrowheads] as well as the pigment granules stuck on the tumor surface [white arrowheads]) (A); ultrasound biomicroscopy shows solid, echogenically homogeneous iris stromal tumor with high internal reflectivity (B).\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their 70s presented to the emergency department (ED) with a unilateral painless right proptosis, first noticed 3 days prior. There was no contributory medical history, recent trauma, or surgery. Visual acuity (VA) was 20/32 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior-segment and fundus examination results were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a right retro-orbital hemorrhage. No etiology could be identified on the image. Systemic corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg per day) was prescribed for 48 hours. The proptosis decreased, and the patient was discharged.After 6 months, complete ophthalmologic examination was performed again; VA was 20/20 OU, and there was no remaining proptosis. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ED for another episode of acute, painless, right proptosis, and the VA had decreased to 20/40 OD. MRI showed a right retrobulbar hemorrhage. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was again prescribed for 48 hours with rapid resolution of the visual impairment but incomplete resolution of the proptosis.One month later, the patient presented to our ophthalmology department. The VA was 20/20 OU, with a persistent, mild, nonreducible, nonpulsatile proptosis unrelated to Valsalva maneuver but associated with extraocular movement limitation in upgaze. A repeated MRI was performed, which showed the following images (Figure 1).T2-weighted coronal (A) and axial (B) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveal an intraorbital lesion.Additional imaging, including a computed tomography and positron emission tomography scan\n",

      "The case is: A middle-aged patient with a remote history of bilateral juvenile cataracts after posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) placement presented with decreased vision in the right eye for several months. There was no recent ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. At the time of the initial examination, visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a refraction of −1.50 diopters (D) sphere in both eyes. Examination was notable for a superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye. Results of the fundus examination were reported to be normal in both eyes and the anterior examination of the left eye was notable for only a well-positioned PCIOL. The patient was referred to a cornea specialist for further evaluation and treatment.Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, specialty evaluation occurred 10 weeks later at which time the patient complained of progressive vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity measured hand motion in the right eye with normal intraocular pressure. The PCIOL was subluxed inferotemporally with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). A 4 mm × 3.1-mm superonasal pigmented scleral lesion was also noted (Figure 1B). The examination of the left eye was remarkable only for a well-centered PCIOL and iris transillumination defects.A, Slitlamp photography of the right eye showing the inferotemporal intraocular lens implant subluxation (arrowhead). B, Slitlamp photography of the right eye documenting a superonasal area of pigmentation on the sclera (arrowhead).Perform a biopsy of the ocular surface lesion\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their 60s with a medical history of hypertension was referred for new-onset fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis. The patient underwent right-sided ptosis repair at another hospital less than 1 year earlier without improvement. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OU, and pupil examination revealed no anisocoria or afferent pupillary defect. Color vision was full in both eyes. External examination revealed a margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) of 0 mm OD, 4 mm OS without fatigability in extended upgaze (Figure 1A). The patient had a small exotropia in primary gaze with a −2 supraduction deficit. No proptosis was observed. An ice pack was applied in the clinic to the ptotic eyelid for 2 minutes, which led to a 1.5-mm improvement (Figure 1B) in ptosis and no appreciable change in strabismus. The patient reported no associated headache, weakness, or difficulty swallowing.External photographs demonstrate ptosis of the right upper eyelid with a margin reflex distance 1 of 0 mm (A) that improved by 1.5 mm after application of an ice pack for 2 minutes (B).Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their 50s presented with asymptomatic keratotic papules, first noticed on the left middle and ring fingers and left toe web spaces more than 10 years earlier. The papules progressed proximally over the subsequent decade to involve the forearm, arm, scapular area, ankle, shin, and thigh, but only affected the left side of the body. The patient’s face, palms, soles, and entire right side of the body were spared. The patient has a history of rosacea being treated with topical metronidazole gel for flares but was otherwise asymptomatic. The patient did not have any alopecia, night blindness, or dry eyes or skin. There was no history of any exposure to radiation or arsenic, nutritional deficiency, inflammatory skin disease, or malignant neoplasm. There was no family history of a similar condition.Examination revealed multiple, submillimeter, skin-colored to yellowish keratotic spiny projections over the aforementioned areas, only on the left side of the body (Figure, A and B). Punch biopsy from a lesion showed orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination. The epidermis was mildly acanthotic and with a normal granular layer. There was a sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Adjacent hair follicles were unaffected (Figure, C).A, Numerous, submillimeter, skin-colored spiny projections over left foot web spaces were present. B, Close-up photograph over the left scapular area showed lesions of similar morphologic characteristics. C, Histologic results showed a parakeratotic column overlying a mildly acanthotic epidermis with a normal granular layer and keratinocyte maturation. A sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate was present (hematoxylin-eosin).\n",

      "The case is: A patient with a history of normal-tension glaucoma presented with a blurred spot in the central vision of the right eye. Examination showed best-corrected visual acuity of 20/50 OD, 20/30 OS, and intraocular pressure of 13 mm Hg OU. In the right eye, dilated fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula revealed subretinal fluid and cystoid spaces within the outer nuclear layer and inner nuclear layer in the nasal macula (Figure 1). Results of the left eye fundus examination and macular OCT were normal. In both eyes, the optic cup appeared very deep with a large cup-disc ratio.Color fundus photograph (A) and optical coherence tomography of the macula (B) illustrating intraretinal and subretinal fluid at the nasal macula. The white line indicates the position of the optical coherence tomography scan.Five years prior to presentation, the patient started treatment with latanoprost nightly in both eyes for an enlarged cup-disc ratio presumed due to normal-tension glaucoma. At that time, intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS and central corneal thickness was normal. Visual field and OCT of the retinal nerve fiber layer were without reproducible defects over 5 years of follow-up. The patient denied a family history of eye disease.\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their early 20s with no medical history or previous symptoms presented for severe frontal headaches and progressive blurred vision in the left eye more than the right eye for several weeks.No localizing signs were documented on neurologic examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast, magnetic resonance angiography of the head, and magnetic resonance venography of the head were obtained and were unremarkable. The result of a lumbar puncture showed 101 white blood cells per high-power field (75% lymphocytes). Results of syphilis serologic tests were negative. The patient was discharged with suspected viral meningitis.At a follow-up visit in an ophthalmology clinic 1 week after discharge, visual acuity was 20/25 OD and counting fingers OS. There was no afferent pupillary defect, and an anterior segment examination was within normal limits. A dilated fundus examination showed numerous bilateral creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina with discrete nummular lesions in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). Fundus autofluorescence showed focal areas of hypoautofluorescence with surrounding hyperautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1B). The patient continued to report severe and progressive headaches along with blurred vision. A review of systems was otherwise unremarkable.A, Left eye. Yellow placoid chorioretinal lesions extend from the posterior pole to the retinal periphery. A creamy chorioretinal lesion (blue arrowhead) signifies active disease. A corresponding lesion (white arrowheads) is visible on both images. B, Focal areas of hypoautofluorescence with adjacent hyperautofluorescence extend from the posterior pole to the retinal periphery.Send for infectious and inflammatory tests and follow up within 1 weekSend for infectious and inflammatory tests, begin oral prednisone therapy, and follow up in 1 weekSend to emergency department for admission and initiation of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate therapy\n",

      "The case is: An older adult presented with a history of a mildly pruritic plaque on the elbow at the site of a prior injury. The medical history was unremarkable, and findings of a review of systems were negative. The patient had been treated in the past with topical steroids without improvement, and the size of the lesion had continued to grow slowly. Physical examination findings revealed a solitary, well-circumscribed pink plaque with overlying yellow-white micaceous scale with interspersed punctate hemorrhagic crusts (Figure, A). Lymphadenopathy was not identified. Punch biopsy for histopathologic examination was performed, with representative sections shown (Figure, B and C).A, Well-circumscribed pink, scaly plaque on the right elbow. B and C, Hematoxylin-eosin–stained sections reveal psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia overlying suppurative granulomatous infiltrates with multinucleate giant cells and rare eosinophilic spheroid forms.\n",

The patient had been treated presumptively for infection with antibiotics, with no improvement. No fever, odynophagia, dysphagia, otalgia, or other constitutional symptoms were reported. Physical examination findings demonstrated a palpable, soft, nontender left level II/III neck mass. Clinical examination findings of the thyroid and upper aerodigestive tract were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) showed a large avidly enhancing mass centered at the left carotid bifurcation splaying the internal and external carotid arteries and extending cranially along the cervical internal carotid artery. The left internal jugular vein was displaced posteriorly. There was also a smaller mass with similar appearance at the right carotid bifurcation (Figure 1A). Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed several enhancing masses in the liver (not shown). Based on CT findings, gallium Ga 68 (68Ga) dotatate positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed; results demonstrated intense radiotracer avidity in bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions (Figure 1B).A, Axial contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) demonstrates large left (black asterisk) and small right (white arrowhead) avidly enhancing bilateral carotid space masses. The left tumor circumferentially encases the left external carotid artery (black arrowhead) and partially encases the left internal carotid artery (yellow arrowhead). B, Coronal gallium 68 dotatate positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) demonstrates intense radiotracer uptake of bilateral carotid space masses (left, black asterisk; right, white arrowhead), hepatic masses (black arrowhead), and CT occult osseous lesions as seen in the right femoral neck (yellow arrowhead).\n",

      "The case is: A 6-month-old infant presented with a congenital papule that had been growing proportionally in size to the infant since birth (Figure 1). No associated pain or pruritus was noted, and the papule had never bled or produced other fluid or debris. The infant had no other congenital anomalies and had been meeting all major developmental milestones. On clinical examination, a superficial, white-yellow papule was identified on the anterior surface of the neck, situated at the midline superior to the sternal notch. It measured 6 mm in diameter and was not associated with overlying surface changes or evident discharge. Dermoscopy results showed scattered telangiectatic vessels over the papule, accentuated peripherally.A smooth, subcutaneous papule with a yellow tint is present above the suprasternal notch and exposed with retraction of skinfolds of the anterior neck.Ultrasonography was performed to further characterize the papule, and imaging results exhibited a superficial cutaneous lesion without evidence of tracking into deeper layers of subcutaneous tissue or fluid collection. Active nonintervention was recommended, but because of continued parental concern, the lesion was shaved off in clinic and sent for histopathologic evaluation to rule out malignant neoplasm and other morbid diagnoses.\n",

      "The case is: A child presented with multiple, asymptomatic, scattered white macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area, which were present at birth and had gradually increased in size and number. Physical examination revealed multiple, well-demarcated, hypopigmented 1- to 5-mm macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area (Figure, A and B). There was no history of any systemic disorder and no family history of similar lesions. Direct microscopic examination of scales soaked in potassium hydroxide did not reveal hyphae. Wood light examination revealed no accentuation. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained for further evaluation (Figure, C and D).A, Multiple discrete hypopigmented macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area. B, Well-demarcated hypopigmented macules on the lower abdomen.

      "The case is: A young child presented to clinic with a 6-month history of an asymptomatic expanding erythematous eruption on the lower legs, abdomen, and buttocks (Figure, A). The eruption would wax and wane, with each episode lasting for approximately 1 week, without residual pigmentation. Clinical examination was significant for faint, nonscaling annular serpiginous, erythematous plaques with central clearing, and barely elevated borders. Test results for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood cell count, antinuclear antibodies, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies, and Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies were within normal limits. There was no family history of autoimmune disease, and the child had not experienced any fevers or exposures to ticks or other arthropods. A punch biopsy specimen from the left thigh was obtained, and histopathological analysis was subsequently performed (Figure, B and C).A, Annular serpiginous plaques with areas of central clearing on the patient’s right thigh and buttocks.

      "The case is: An adult patient with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus and cystic fibrosis was seen with painless, rapidly declining vision in both eyes of 1-month duration. The patient had initially seen a general ophthalmologist 1 week after noticing a change in vision and was diagnosed as having bilateral cataracts. Given a continued decline in vision over the next 2 weeks, the patient sought a second opinion. The patient reported taking 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate daily (6.3 mg/kg/d) during the past 2 years, with normal renal function, but denied any recent change in medications.On initial examination, visual acuity (VA) was counting fingers at 2 ft OD and at 3 ft OS. Intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Pupils were equal and mildly sluggish to react to light but demonstrated no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slitlamp examination revealed 1+ nuclear sclerosis cataracts. Dilated fundus examination demonstrated normal-appearing retinal and optic nerve architecture with the exception of mild arteriolar narrowing bilaterally (Figure 1A). Results of optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retinal nerve fiber layer and macula, as well as fundus autofluorescence, were normal (Figure 1B). In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without gadolinium were unremarkable.A, Baseline color fundus photograph of the right eye demonstrates normal optic nerve color and contour, with mild arteriolar narrowing.

      "The case is: A child younger than 10 years presented with an 8-week history of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy unresponsive to a 10-day course of Augmentin (GlaxoSmithKline). The patient’s parents denied any associated fevers, chills, night sweats, sore throat, abdominal pain, or weight changes. Medical history was noncontributory.Physical examination showed bilateral, mobile, nontender cervical lymphadenopathy without erythema or swelling. Tonsils were symmetric and not enlarged. There was no noticeable thyromegaly or nodules. Laboratory testing was significant for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (37 mmol/h). Ultrasonography demonstrated cervical lymphadenopathy bilaterally with the largest node measuring 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. Lymph node needle core biopsy demonstrated increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells on tissue section (Figure, A). Scattered neutrophils and rare giant cells were also present. Findings of Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast, and Warthin-Starry stains were negative. The CD-68 immunostain showed numerous histiocytes. The specimen stained positive for CD-30 and S-100 immunostains showing emperipolesis (Figure, B and C). Findings of a CD1a stain were negative. Lymphoid markers by flow cytometry showed a polyclonal mixed B-cell and T-cell population.Lymph node needle core biopsy specimens from the patient.

      "The case is: A 35-year-old white head and neck surgeon with an unremarkable medical history was referred to the Surgical Emergency Department for a phlegmon of the flexor tendon sheath of the right hand. The lesion progressively developed several days after an unintentional exposure to blood with a blade used to drain an abscess of the oral cavity. The patient presented a deep wound induced by the bistoury piercing of the index finger pulp of the right hand, with a disrupted epidermal barrier. Both the patient who was operated on and the surgeon were negative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B/C virus testing. A soft tissue abscess of the digit appeared 7 days after the initial trauma. Antibiotic therapy combining amoxicillin and clavulanate was started, without any significant improvement. Surgery was performed urgently, with excision of the wound entrance and washing of the flexor tendon sheath. Bacteriological swabs were performed in the same time. An antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate was prescribed. Forty-eight hours after surgery, pustules appeared. Further drainage and washing of the sheath were repeated (Figure, A). The bacteriological samples were found to be sterile. The surgeon was hospitalized for infusions combining piperacillin/tazobactam and teicoplanine, carried out over 72 hours. An oral antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate (3 g every 24 hours) was prescribed for 10 additional days. The lesions completely resolved within 2 weeks. One year later, the surgeon presented with prodromal burning pain of the same index finger, and a similar soft tissue abscess recurred after 48 hours at the same site of the original lesion with a small painful vesicle progressively developed (Figure, B).A, Clinical aspect of the index finger 2 days after the second surgery.

      "The case is: An ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure was performed for a neonate born by cesarean delivery at 37 weeks of gestation with a prenatally diagnosed neck mass. Initial laryngoscopy with a Parsons laryngoscope identified airway deviation secondary to mass effect, with intubation ultimately achieved with assistance of a bronchoscope. Examination revealed a large neck mass extending from the mandible to the clavicles, with mass effect causing neck extension and rotation. The mass was multicystic, with prominent vasculature, and a small area of skin necrosis. Following birth, the mass continued to grow, with inability to palpate the sternal notch by day of life 4 (Figure, A). The patient underwent a magnetic resonance image (MRI) on day of life 3 which showed a 15.7 × 10.0 × 14.4-cm midline neck mass with solid and cystic components. Flow voids were present throughout the mass. The mass was isointense to hypointense on T1, and isointense to hyperintense on T2. The patient also underwent a computed tomographic (CT) scan, which demonstrated calcifications present within the multicystic neck mass. Owing to continued growth and risk of airway compromise, the patient was taken to the operating room on day 5 of life for resection of the mass and tracheostomy. Pathologic results showed a multinodular 19-cm mass, 80% solid and 20% cystic, with multiple tissue types present (Figure, B-D).\n",
