      "The case is: A 60-year-old Black patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion, 3 months of toe numbness, and unintended weight loss of 8 kg over 6 months. The patient also had a history of lumbar spinal stenosis. On presentation, blood pressure was 104/73 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed edema to the mid-calf bilaterally, hypoesthesia below the knees, and ankle plantar flexion strength of 3 of 5 based on the Medical Research Council Scale for muscle strength. Laboratory testing revealed a high-sensitivity troponin level of 52 ng/L (reference, <34 ng/L); brain-type natriuretic peptide, 112 pmol/L (reference, <30 pmol/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L) (reference, 0-35 U/L [0-0.58 μkat/L]); and alanine aminotransferase, 76 U/L (1.27 μkat/L) (reference, 0-45 U/L [0-0.75 μkat/L]). A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly without pulmonary vascular redistribution or pulmonary edema.An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, left anterior fascicular block, and down-sloping anterolateral ST segments. The patient was admitted to the hospital, where electromyography results included reduced amplitude of peroneal nerve action potentials, consistent with axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities. Coronary angiography showed no coronary atherosclerosis, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Results of serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum free light chain testing were normal. A bone scintigraphy scan using technetium Tc 99m–labeled hydroxymethylene diphosphonate demonstrated increased cardiac uptake (Figure).Anterior (left) and posterior (right) bone scintigraphy scan of the patient.\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their mid-30s with a medical history of deceased donor kidney transplant, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, and CMV viremia with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir (UL97 and UL54 gene mutations) presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes. The patient was taking systemic immunosuppression but recently stopped taking maribavir because of concerns about resistance and was transitioned to cidofovir and CMV immune globulin. On clinical examination, the visual acuity measured 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed tortuous vasculature, multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades and periphery, and granular, hypopigmented retinal lesions without hemorrhage in the macula and temporal periphery in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography showed localized areas of full-thickness retinitis (Figure 1B). CMV titers indicated viremia at 2.24 million IU/mL. Despite the patient’s documented UL97 and UL54 mutations, a series of 5 biweekly intravitreal injections of foscarnet and ganciclovir were performed given their vision-threatening lesions.\n",

      "The case is: A 25-month-old child with unilateral hearing loss was referred to a pediatric ear, nose, and throat surgeon in a secondary care hospital. Clinical findings suggested unilateral right middle ear effusion associated with ipsilateral conductive hearing loss. After an initial observation period, a right tympanostomy tube was inserted. During the procedure, a clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear was noted, and samples were sent for β-2-transferrine analysis. This confirmed the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak.The patient was referred to our tertiary referral center hospital. The leak settled with conservative management, and imaging of the brain and skull base was performed. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone showed a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule (Figure 1A). There was soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull base with contrast was performed (Figure 1B). It showed a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. There was a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed signs of Chiari malformation type 1. After a skull base multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a bone biopsy through a transmastoid approach.A, Axial high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bones at the level of the basal turn of the cochlea showed osteolysis involving the petrous part of the right temporal bone. There was associated soft tissue partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells. The destructive process did not involve the otic capsule. B, Coronal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and skull base, T2-weighted images showed a hypersignal in the right mastoid and middle ear with suspected communication through the tegmen. There was also a hypersignal in the soft tissues of the right neck in keeping with extravasation of cerebrospinal fluid in cervical lymphatics.\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their mid-60s was referred for evaluation of a left iris pigmented lesion. The mass had been present for decades and multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists, most recently 4 years prior, showed the mass remained stable in size.The patient’s ocular history included cataract extraction with intraocular lens placement and retinal tear of the right eye and cataract of the left eye. Review of systems was negative for any recent changes in health, weight loss, fever, or night sweats. Visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/25+ OS. Intraocular pressures were normal.Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, and the left eye had a raised pigmented iris lesion without prominent internal vasculature and with mammillations on the surface (multiple small smooth dome-shaped protuberances on the surface of the tumor). There were large pigment granules on the surface of the tumor and on the adjacent iris surrounding the mass (Figure 1A). There was no ectropion uvea or iris neovascularization. There were mild nuclear sclerotic changes across the lens in the left eye. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a homogeneous intrinsic iris solid tumor with a height of 1.4 mm and basal diameter of 4.1 mm, without angle or ciliary body involvement (Figure 1B).Color slitlamp photograph shows a pigmented iris mass (note both the mammillations [black arrowheads] as well as the pigment granules stuck on the tumor surface [white arrowheads]) (A); ultrasound biomicroscopy shows solid, echogenically homogeneous iris stromal tumor with high internal reflectivity (B).\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their 70s presented to the emergency department (ED) with a unilateral painless right proptosis, first noticed 3 days prior. There was no contributory medical history, recent trauma, or surgery. Visual acuity (VA) was 20/32 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior-segment and fundus examination results were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a right retro-orbital hemorrhage. No etiology could be identified on the image. Systemic corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg per day) was prescribed for 48 hours. The proptosis decreased, and the patient was discharged.After 6 months, complete ophthalmologic examination was performed again; VA was 20/20 OU, and there was no remaining proptosis. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ED for another episode of acute, painless, right proptosis, and the VA had decreased to 20/40 OD. MRI showed a right retrobulbar hemorrhage. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was again prescribed for 48 hours with rapid resolution of the visual impairment but incomplete resolution of the proptosis.One month later, the patient presented to our ophthalmology department. The VA was 20/20 OU, with a persistent, mild, nonreducible, nonpulsatile proptosis unrelated to Valsalva maneuver but associated with extraocular movement limitation in upgaze.\n",

      "The case is: A middle-aged patient with a remote history of bilateral juvenile cataracts after posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) placement presented with decreased vision in the right eye for several months. There was no recent ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. At the time of the initial examination, visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a refraction of −1.50 diopters (D) sphere in both eyes. Examination was notable for a superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye. Results of the fundus examination were reported to be normal in both eyes and the anterior examination of the left eye was notable for only a well-positioned PCIOL. The patient was referred to a cornea specialist for further evaluation and treatment.Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, specialty evaluation occurred 10 weeks later at which time the patient complained of progressive vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity measured hand motion in the right eye with normal intraocular pressure. The PCIOL was subluxed inferotemporally with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). A 4 mm × 3.1-mm superonasal pigmented scleral lesion was also noted (Figure 1B). The examination of the left eye was remarkable only for a well-centered PCIOL and iris transillumination defects.A, Slitlamp photography of the right eye showing the inferotemporal intraocular lens implant subluxation (arrowhead).\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their 60s with a medical history of hypertension was referred for new-onset fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis. The patient underwent right-sided ptosis repair at another hospital less than 1 year earlier without improvement. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OU, and pupil examination revealed no anisocoria or afferent pupillary defect. Color vision was full in both eyes. External examination revealed a margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) of 0 mm OD, 4 mm OS without fatigability in extended upgaze (Figure 1A). The patient had a small exotropia in primary gaze with a −2 supraduction deficit. No proptosis was observed. An ice pack was applied in the clinic to the ptotic eyelid for 2 minutes, which led to a 1.5-mm improvement (Figure 1B) in ptosis and no appreciable change in strabismus.\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their 50s presented with asymptomatic keratotic papules, first noticed on the left middle and ring fingers and left toe web spaces more than 10 years earlier. The papules progressed proximally over the subsequent decade to involve the forearm, arm, scapular area, ankle, shin, and thigh, but only affected the left side of the body. The patient’s face, palms, soles, and entire right side of the body were spared. The patient has a history of rosacea being treated with topical metronidazole gel for flares but was otherwise asymptomatic. The patient did not have any alopecia, night blindness, or dry eyes or skin. There was no history of any exposure to radiation or arsenic, nutritional deficiency, inflammatory skin disease, or malignant neoplasm. There was no family history of a similar condition.Examination revealed multiple, submillimeter, skin-colored to yellowish keratotic spiny projections over the aforementioned areas, only on the left side of the body (Figure, A and B). Punch biopsy from a lesion showed orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination. The epidermis was mildly acanthotic and with a normal granular layer. There was a sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Adjacent hair follicles were unaffected (Figure, C).A, Numerous, submillimeter, skin-colored spiny projections over left foot web spaces were present. B, Close-up photograph over the left scapular area showed lesions of similar morphologic characteristics. C, Histologic results showed a parakeratotic column overlying a mildly acanthotic epidermis with a normal granular layer and keratinocyte maturation.

      "The case is: A patient with a history of normal-tension glaucoma presented with a blurred spot in the central vision of the right eye. Examination showed best-corrected visual acuity of 20/50 OD, 20/30 OS, and intraocular pressure of 13 mm Hg OU. In the right eye, dilated fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula revealed subretinal fluid and cystoid spaces within the outer nuclear layer and inner nuclear layer in the nasal macula (Figure 1). Results of the left eye fundus examination and macular OCT were normal. In both eyes, the optic cup appeared very deep with a large cup-disc ratio.Color fundus photograph (A) and optical coherence tomography of the macula (B) illustrating intraretinal and subretinal fluid at the nasal macula. The white line indicates the position of the optical coherence tomography scan.Five years prior to presentation, the patient started treatment with latanoprost nightly in both eyes for an enlarged cup-disc ratio presumed due to normal-tension glaucoma. At that time, intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS and central corneal thickness was normal. Visual field and OCT of the retinal nerve fiber layer were without reproducible defects over 5 years of follow-up. The patient denied a family history of eye disease.\n",

      "The case is: A 47-year-old woman, with dyslipidemia, presented to the emergency department with sudden vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior segment, tonometry, and pupillary light reflex were unremarkable. Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye showed discretely blurred optic disc margins, tortuous and dilated retinal veins, and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants; the left eye was unremarkable. An optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan showed a cystoid macular edema (CME) in the right eye; the left was unremarkable. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was 133 μm OD and 82 μm OS (reference value, 95.4 ± 10.48 μm).1 A fluorescein angiography was scheduled. One week later, the patient returned to our department due to multiple episodes of amaurosis fugax in left eye. By that time, ophthalmoscopy disclosed a mild optic disc swelling, tortuous venous vessels, and retinal hemorrhages bilaterally (Figure 1). The OCT scan showed a CME spontaneous resolution in the right eye while the left eye was unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography revealed a slight delay in venous filling but no capillary nonperfusion areas. These features were compatible with bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye.Fundus photography of the right and left eyes showing slightly elevated and blurred optic disc margins (asterisk), mildly tortuous and dilated retinal vessels (black arrowheads), and intraretinal hemorrhages (pink arrowheads) in all quadrants in both eyes. In the left eye, a superficial optic nerve drusen (white arrowhead) was noted.A hypercoagulability and autoimmune workup—including peripheral blood smear, complete blood cell count, serum hyperviscosity, total protein level, protein electrophoresis, factor V Leiden, prothrombin, protein C and S, antithrombin, anticardiolipin, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies—gave normal results. A brain angiomagnetic resonance imaging scan was performed, which excluded central thrombosis.\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their early 20s with no medical history or previous symptoms presented for severe frontal headaches and progressive blurred vision in the left eye more than the right eye for several weeks.No localizing signs were documented on neurologic examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast, magnetic resonance angiography of the head, and magnetic resonance venography of the head were obtained and were unremarkable. The result of a lumbar puncture showed 101 white blood cells per high-power field (75% lymphocytes). Results of syphilis serologic tests were negative. The patient was discharged with suspected viral meningitis.At a follow-up visit in an ophthalmology clinic 1 week after discharge, visual acuity was 20/25 OD and counting fingers OS. There was no afferent pupillary defect, and an anterior segment examination was within normal limits. A dilated fundus examination showed numerous bilateral creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina with discrete nummular lesions in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). Fundus autofluorescence showed focal areas of hypoautofluorescence with surrounding hyperautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1B). The patient continued to report severe and progressive headaches along with blurred vision. A review of systems was otherwise unremarkable.A, Left eye.

      "The case is: A 72-year-old White woman, who was experiencing episodes of nontraumatic transient vision loss for 2 weeks, was evaluated by an ophthalmologist. On examination, visual acuity was 20/30 OU. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 16 mm Hg OD and 41 mm Hg OS. The anterior segment was normal in the right eye. Anterior examination of the left eye revealed 10% hyphema. The patient was prescribed cyclopentolate, 1%, and prednisolone acetate, 1%, to reduce inflammation and lower the IOP in the left eye. Two days later, IOP was 16 mm Hg OD and 10 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp biomicroscopy revealed resolved hyphema and abnormal blood vessels at the superotemporal pupillary margin of the iris, prompting referral for further evaluation.On further examination, visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/50 OS, and IOP was 15 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination results in the right eye appeared normal, whereas the left eye demonstrated subtle, multifocal ectatic vascular channels arranged circumferentially at the pupillary margin (Figure 1A, arrowheads). On fluorescein angiography (FA), both the right and left irises displayed multifocal, pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence at the pupillary margin and was more noticeable on the left iris (Figure 1B, arrowheads). The remainder of the eye examination was unremarkable, and there was no sign of neovascularization of the retina or disc.A, Slitlamp photograph of the left eye depicting a vascular lesion at the 2 o’clock position in the pupillary margin (inset, arrowheads).\n",

      "The case is: A young adult nonsmoker patient with a history of asthma presented with a palpable mass on the left side of the neck that had been present for several months, reportedly unchanged. The patient had been treated presumptively for infection with antibiotics, with no improvement. No fever, odynophagia, dysphagia, otalgia, or other constitutional symptoms were reported. Physical examination findings demonstrated a palpable, soft, nontender left level II/III neck mass. Clinical examination findings of the thyroid and upper aerodigestive tract were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) showed a large avidly enhancing mass centered at the left carotid bifurcation splaying the internal and external carotid arteries and extending cranially along the cervical internal carotid artery. The left internal jugular vein was displaced posteriorly. There was also a smaller mass with similar appearance at the right carotid bifurcation (Figure 1A). Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed several enhancing masses in the liver (not shown). Based on CT findings, gallium Ga 68 (68Ga) dotatate positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed; results demonstrated intense radiotracer avidity in bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions (Figure 1B).A, Axial contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) demonstrates large left (black asterisk) and small right (white arrowhead) avidly enhancing bilateral carotid space masses. The left tumor circumferentially encases the left external carotid artery (black arrowhead) and partially encases the left internal carotid artery (yellow arrowhead). B, Coronal gallium 68 dotatate positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) demonstrates intense radiotracer uptake of bilateral carotid space masses (left, black asterisk; right, white arrowhead), hepatic masses (black arrowhead), and CT occult osseous lesions as seen in the right femoral neck (yellow arrowhead).\n",

      "The case is: An infant boy, born to a nonconsanguineously wed couple, presented to the dermatology outpatient clinic with recurrent skin blisters since age 2 months. The lesions initially started over the trunk and subsequently progressed to involve the face, hands, and feet. The episodes of skin blisters were accompanied by pruritus and redness all over the body. There was no history of oral erosions or difficulty in feeding. Bowel and bladder movements were normal. The child had an older sibling who had no skin ailments, and none of the other family members were affected.On examination, multiple tense, angulated vesicles and bullae on a background of erythema were seen over the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Few urticated papules and wheals were seen in isolation over the trunk. The ruptured bullae were healing with hypopigmentation with accompanying scarring and discrete milia formation. The mucosae and nails were normal. No contractures or webbing of fingers was noted. There was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy from a vesicle was subsequently performed (Figure, C and D).A, Multiple angulated vesicles and tense bullae over the forehead and chin. Background erythema can be appreciated. B, Tense bullae over the trunk with superficial erosions and postinflammatory hypopigmentation, which are healing with scarring and discrete milia formation.

      "The case is: A 6-month-old infant presented with a congenital papule that had been growing proportionally in size to the infant since birth (Figure 1). No associated pain or pruritus was noted, and the papule had never bled or produced other fluid or debris. The infant had no other congenital anomalies and had been meeting all major developmental milestones. On clinical examination, a superficial, white-yellow papule was identified on the anterior surface of the neck, situated at the midline superior to the sternal notch. It measured 6 mm in diameter and was not associated with overlying surface changes or evident discharge. Dermoscopy results showed scattered telangiectatic vessels over the papule, accentuated peripherally.A smooth, subcutaneous papule with a yellow tint is present above the suprasternal notch and exposed with retraction of skinfolds of the anterior neck.Ultrasonography was performed to further characterize the papule, and imaging results exhibited a superficial cutaneous lesion without evidence of tracking into deeper layers of subcutaneous tissue or fluid collection. Active nonintervention was recommended, but because of continued parental concern, the lesion was shaved off in clinic and sent for histopathologic evaluation to rule out malignant neoplasm and other morbid diagnoses.\n",

      "The case is: A healthy 29-year-old pregnant woman, with 34 weeks’ gestational age, presented to the emergency department with diffused acute abdominal pain and vomiting. The pain was located in the periumbilical region and intensified within a few hours. The patient felt normal fetal movements during this time. An initial surgical evaluation was done, and the cause for the abdominal pain was assumed to be not of surgical condition. Next, the patient was evaluated by an obstetrician-gynecologist, and although the gynecologic examination, ultrasonography, and monitoring were all normal, the patient was admitted for further supervision in the obstetrics department. The next day, when the abdominal pain and vomiting persisted and an elevated leukocyte blood count of 14 200/mL was noted (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), a second surgical consultation was done. The physical examination was significant for diffuse abdominal tenderness. Although the patient was pregnant, and owing to nonavailability of magnetic resonance imaging at that time, a contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography was performed (Figure 1).Coronal computed tomographic image showing an edematous small intestinal loop on the left abdomen, with uterus and head of fetus in the pelvis.\n",

      "The case is: A child presented with multiple, asymptomatic, scattered white macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area, which were present at birth and had gradually increased in size and number. Physical examination revealed multiple, well-demarcated, hypopigmented 1- to 5-mm macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area (Figure, A and B). There was no history of any systemic disorder and no family history of similar lesions. Direct microscopic examination of scales soaked in potassium hydroxide did not reveal hyphae. Wood light examination revealed no accentuation. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained for further evaluation (Figure, C and D).A, Multiple discrete hypopigmented macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area. B, Well-demarcated hypopigmented macules on the lower abdomen. C, Histopathological examination revealed mild hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and scattered clear cells in the epidermis (hematoxylin-eosin).

      "The case is: A young child presented to clinic with a 6-month history of an asymptomatic expanding erythematous eruption on the lower legs, abdomen, and buttocks (Figure, A). The eruption would wax and wane, with each episode lasting for approximately 1 week, without residual pigmentation. Clinical examination was significant for faint, nonscaling annular serpiginous, erythematous plaques with central clearing, and barely elevated borders. Test results for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood cell count, antinuclear antibodies, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies, and Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies were within normal limits. There was no family history of autoimmune disease, and the child had not experienced any fevers or exposures to ticks or other arthropods. A punch biopsy specimen from the left thigh was obtained, and histopathological analysis was subsequently performed (Figure, B and C).A, Annular serpiginous plaques with areas of central clearing on the patient’s right thigh and buttocks.

      "The case is: An adult patient with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus and cystic fibrosis was seen with painless, rapidly declining vision in both eyes of 1-month duration. The patient had initially seen a general ophthalmologist 1 week after noticing a change in vision and was diagnosed as having bilateral cataracts. Given a continued decline in vision over the next 2 weeks, the patient sought a second opinion. The patient reported taking 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate daily (6.3 mg/kg/d) during the past 2 years, with normal renal function, but denied any recent change in medications.On initial examination, visual acuity (VA) was counting fingers at 2 ft OD and at 3 ft OS. Intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Pupils were equal and mildly sluggish to react to light but demonstrated no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slitlamp examination revealed 1+ nuclear sclerosis cataracts. Dilated fundus examination demonstrated normal-appearing retinal and optic nerve architecture with the exception of mild arteriolar narrowing bilaterally (Figure 1A). Results of optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retinal nerve fiber layer and macula, as well as fundus autofluorescence, were normal (Figure 1B). In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without gadolinium were unremarkable.A, Baseline color fundus photograph of the right eye demonstrates normal optic nerve color and contour, with mild arteriolar narrowing.\n",

      "The case is: A child younger than 10 years presented with an 8-week history of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy unresponsive to a 10-day course of Augmentin (GlaxoSmithKline). The patient’s parents denied any associated fevers, chills, night sweats, sore throat, abdominal pain, or weight changes. Medical history was noncontributory.Physical examination showed bilateral, mobile, nontender cervical lymphadenopathy without erythema or swelling. Tonsils were symmetric and not enlarged. There was no noticeable thyromegaly or nodules. Laboratory testing was significant for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (37 mmol/h). Ultrasonography demonstrated cervical lymphadenopathy bilaterally with the largest node measuring 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. Lymph node needle core biopsy demonstrated increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells on tissue section (Figure, A). Scattered neutrophils and rare giant cells were also present. Findings of Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast, and Warthin-Starry stains were negative. The CD-68 immunostain showed numerous histiocytes. The specimen stained positive for CD-30 and S-100 immunostains showing emperipolesis (Figure, B and C). Findings of a CD1a stain were negative. Lymphoid markers by flow cytometry showed a polyclonal mixed B-cell and T-cell population.Lymph node needle core biopsy specimens from the patient.

      "The case is: A 35-year-old white head and neck surgeon with an unremarkable medical history was referred to the Surgical Emergency Department for a phlegmon of the flexor tendon sheath of the right hand. The lesion progressively developed several days after an unintentional exposure to blood with a blade used to drain an abscess of the oral cavity. The patient presented a deep wound induced by the bistoury piercing of the index finger pulp of the right hand, with a disrupted epidermal barrier. Both the patient who was operated on and the surgeon were negative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B/C virus testing. A soft tissue abscess of the digit appeared 7 days after the initial trauma. Antibiotic therapy combining amoxicillin and clavulanate was started, without any significant improvement. Surgery was performed urgently, with excision of the wound entrance and washing of the flexor tendon sheath. Bacteriological swabs were performed in the same time. An antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate was prescribed. Forty-eight hours after surgery, pustules appeared. Further drainage and washing of the sheath were repeated (Figure, A). The bacteriological samples were found to be sterile. The surgeon was hospitalized for infusions combining piperacillin/tazobactam and teicoplanine, carried out over 72 hours. An oral antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate (3 g every 24 hours) was prescribed for 10 additional days. The lesions completely resolved within 2 weeks. One year later, the surgeon presented with prodromal burning pain of the same index finger, and a similar soft tissue abscess recurred after 48 hours at the same site of the original lesion with a small painful vesicle progressively developed (Figure, B).A, Clinical aspect of the index finger 2 days after the second surgery. B, Recurrence of the soft tissue abscess.\n",

      "The case is: An ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure was performed for a neonate born by cesarean delivery at 37 weeks of gestation with a prenatally diagnosed neck mass. Initial laryngoscopy with a Parsons laryngoscope identified airway deviation secondary to mass effect, with intubation ultimately achieved with assistance of a bronchoscope. Examination revealed a large neck mass extending from the mandible to the clavicles, with mass effect causing neck extension and rotation. The mass was multicystic, with prominent vasculature, and a small area of skin necrosis. Following birth, the mass continued to grow, with inability to palpate the sternal notch by day of life 4 (Figure, A). The patient underwent a magnetic resonance image (MRI) on day of life 3 which showed a 15.7 × 10.0 × 14.4-cm midline neck mass with solid and cystic components. Flow voids were present throughout the mass. The mass was isointense to hypointense on T1, and isointense to hyperintense on T2. The patient also underwent a computed tomographic (CT) scan, which demonstrated calcifications present within the multicystic neck mass. Owing to continued growth and risk of airway compromise, the patient was taken to the operating room on day 5 of life for resection of the mass and tracheostomy. Pathologic results showed a multinodular 19-cm mass, 80% solid and 20% cystic, with multiple tissue types present (Figure, B-D).\n",
