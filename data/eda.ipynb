      "The case is: A 60-year-old Black patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion, 3 months of toe numbness, and unintended weight loss of 8 kg over 6 months. The patient also had a history of lumbar spinal stenosis. On presentation, blood pressure was 104/73 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed edema to the mid-calf bilaterally, hypoesthesia below the knees, and ankle plantar flexion strength of 3 of 5 based on the Medical Research Council Scale for muscle strength. Laboratory testing revealed a high-sensitivity troponin level of 52 ng/L (reference, <34 ng/L); brain-type natriuretic peptide, 112 pmol/L (reference, <30 pmol/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L) (reference, 0-35 U/L [0-0.58 μkat/L]); and alanine aminotransferase, 76 U/L (1.27 μkat/L) (reference, 0-45 U/L [0-0.75 μkat/L]). A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly without pulmonary vascular redistribution or pulmonary edema.An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, left anterior fascicular block, and down-sloping anterolateral ST segments. The patient was admitted to the hospital, where electromyography results included reduced amplitude of peroneal nerve action potentials, consistent with axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities. Coronary angiography showed no coronary atherosclerosis, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Results of serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum free light chain testing were normal.\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their mid-30s with a medical history of deceased donor kidney transplant, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, and CMV viremia with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir (UL97 and UL54 gene mutations) presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes. The patient was taking systemic immunosuppression but recently stopped taking maribavir because of concerns about resistance and was transitioned to cidofovir and CMV immune globulin. On clinical examination, the visual acuity measured 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed tortuous vasculature, multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades and periphery, and granular, hypopigmented retinal lesions without hemorrhage in the macula and temporal periphery in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography showed localized areas of full-thickness retinitis (Figure 1B). CMV titers indicated viremia at 2.24 million IU/mL.\n",

      "The case is: A 25-month-old child with unilateral hearing loss was referred to a pediatric ear, nose, and throat surgeon in a secondary care hospital. Clinical findings suggested unilateral right middle ear effusion associated with ipsilateral conductive hearing loss. After an initial observation period, a right tympanostomy tube was inserted. During the procedure, a clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear was noted, and samples were sent for β-2-transferrine analysis. This confirmed the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak.The patient was referred to our tertiary referral center hospital. The leak settled with conservative management, and imaging of the brain and skull base was performed. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone showed a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule (Figure 1A). There was soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull base with contrast was performed (Figure 1B). It showed a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. There was a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed signs of Chiari malformation type 1. After a skull base multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a bone biopsy through a transmastoid approach.A, Axial high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bones at the level of the basal turn of the cochlea showed osteolysis involving the petrous part of the right temporal bone. There was associated soft tissue partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells. The destructive process did not involve the otic capsule. B, Coronal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and skull base, T2-weighted images showed a hypersignal in the right mastoid and middle ear with suspected communication through the tegmen.\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their mid-60s was referred for evaluation of a left iris pigmented lesion. The mass had been present for decades and multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists, most recently 4 years prior, showed the mass remained stable in size.The patient’s ocular history included cataract extraction with intraocular lens placement and retinal tear of the right eye and cataract of the left eye. Review of systems was negative for any recent changes in health, weight loss, fever, or night sweats. Visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/25+ OS. Intraocular pressures were normal.Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, and the left eye had a raised pigmented iris lesion without prominent internal vasculature and with mammillations on the surface (multiple small smooth dome-shaped protuberances on the surface of the tumor). There were large pigment granules on the surface of the tumor and on the adjacent iris surrounding the mass (Figure 1A). There was no ectropion uvea or iris neovascularization. There were mild nuclear sclerotic changes across the lens in the left eye.\n",
      "----\n",
      "The case is: A patient in their 70s presented to the emergency department (ED) with a unilateral painless right proptosis, first noticed 3 days prior. There was no contributory medical history, recent trauma, or surgery. Visual acuity (VA) was 20/32 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior-segment and fundus examination results were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a right retro-orbital hemorrhage. No etiology could be identified on the image. Systemic corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg per day) was prescribed for 48 hours. The proptosis decreased, and the patient was discharged.After 6 months, complete ophthalmologic examination was performed again; VA was 20/20 OU, and there was no remaining proptosis. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ED for another episode of acute, painless, right proptosis, and the VA had decreased to 20/40 OD. MRI showed a right retrobulbar hemorrhage. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was again prescribed for 48 hours with rapid resolution of the visual impairment but incomplete resolution of the proptosis.One month later, the patient presented to our ophthalmology department.\n",

      "The case is: A middle-aged patient with a remote history of bilateral juvenile cataracts after posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) placement presented with decreased vision in the right eye for several months. There was no recent ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. At the time of the initial examination, visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a refraction of −1.50 diopters (D) sphere in both eyes. Examination was notable for a superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye. Results of the fundus examination were reported to be normal in both eyes and the anterior examination of the left eye was notable for only a well-positioned PCIOL. The patient was referred to a cornea specialist for further evaluation and treatment.Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, specialty evaluation occurred 10 weeks later at which time the patient complained of progressive vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity measured hand motion in the right eye with normal intraocular pressure. The PCIOL was subluxed inferotemporally with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). A 4 mm × 3.1-mm superonasal pigmented scleral lesion was also noted (Figure 1B).\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their 60s with a medical history of hypertension was referred for new-onset fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis. The patient underwent right-sided ptosis repair at another hospital less than 1 year earlier without improvement. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OU, and pupil examination revealed no anisocoria or afferent pupillary defect. Color vision was full in both eyes. External examination revealed a margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) of 0 mm OD, 4 mm OS without fatigability in extended upgaze (Figure 1A). The patient had a small exotropia in primary gaze with a −2 supraduction deficit. No proptosis was observed.\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their 50s presented with asymptomatic keratotic papules, first noticed on the left middle and ring fingers and left toe web spaces more than 10 years earlier. The papules progressed proximally over the subsequent decade to involve the forearm, arm, scapular area, ankle, shin, and thigh, but only affected the left side of the body. The patient’s face, palms, soles, and entire right side of the body were spared. The patient has a history of rosacea being treated with topical metronidazole gel for flares but was otherwise asymptomatic. The patient did not have any alopecia, night blindness, or dry eyes or skin. There was no history of any exposure to radiation or arsenic, nutritional deficiency, inflammatory skin disease, or malignant neoplasm. There was no family history of a similar condition.Examination revealed multiple, submillimeter, skin-colored to yellowish keratotic spiny projections over the aforementioned areas, only on the left side of the body (Figure, A and B). Punch biopsy from a lesion showed orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination. The epidermis was mildly acanthotic and with a normal granular layer. There was a sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Adjacent hair follicles were unaffected (Figure, C).A, Numerous, submillimeter, skin-colored spiny projections over left foot web spaces were present. B, Close-up photograph over the left scapular area showed lesions of similar morphologic characteristics. C, Histologic results showed a parakeratotic column overlying a mildly acanthotic epidermis with a normal granular layer and keratinocyte maturation.\n",

      "The case is: A patient with a history of normal-tension glaucoma presented with a blurred spot in the central vision of the right eye. Examination showed best-corrected visual acuity of 20/50 OD, 20/30 OS, and intraocular pressure of 13 mm Hg OU. In the right eye, dilated fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula revealed subretinal fluid and cystoid spaces within the outer nuclear layer and inner nuclear layer in the nasal macula (Figure 1). Results of the left eye fundus examination and macular OCT were normal. In both eyes, the optic cup appeared very deep with a large cup-disc ratio.Color fundus photograph (A) and optical coherence tomography of the macula (B) illustrating intraretinal and subretinal fluid at the nasal macula. The white line indicates the position of the optical coherence tomography scan.Five years prior to presentation, the patient started treatment with latanoprost nightly in both eyes for an enlarged cup-disc ratio presumed due to normal-tension glaucoma. At that time, intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS and central corneal thickness was normal. Visual field and OCT of the retinal nerve fiber layer were without reproducible defects over 5 years of follow-up.\n",

      "The case is: A patient in their early 20s with no medical history or previous symptoms presented for severe frontal headaches and progressive blurred vision in the left eye more than the right eye for several weeks.No localizing signs were documented on neurologic examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast, magnetic resonance angiography of the head, and magnetic resonance venography of the head were obtained and were unremarkable. The result of a lumbar puncture showed 101 white blood cells per high-power field (75% lymphocytes). Results of syphilis serologic tests were negative. The patient was discharged with suspected viral meningitis.At a follow-up visit in an ophthalmology clinic 1 week after discharge, visual acuity was 20/25 OD and counting fingers OS. There was no afferent pupillary defect, and an anterior segment examination was within normal limits. A dilated fundus examination showed numerous bilateral creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina with discrete nummular lesions in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). Fundus autofluorescence showed focal areas of hypoautofluorescence with surrounding hyperautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1B). The patient continued to report severe and progressive headaches along with blurred vision. A review of systems was otherwise unremarkable.A, Left eye. Yellow placoid chorioretinal lesions extend from the posterior pole to the retinal periphery. A creamy chorioretinal lesion (blue arrowhead) signifies active disease.\n",

      "The case is: An older adult presented with a history of a mildly pruritic plaque on the elbow at the site of a prior injury. The medical history was unremarkable, and findings of a review of systems were negative. The patient had been treated in the past with topical steroids without improvement, and the size of the lesion had continued to grow slowly. Physical examination findings revealed a solitary, well-circumscribed pink plaque with overlying yellow-white micaceous scale with interspersed punctate hemorrhagic crusts (Figure, A). Lymphadenopathy was not identified. Punch biopsy for histopathologic examination was performed, with representative sections shown (Figure, B and C).A, Well-circumscribed pink, scaly plaque on the right elbow.\n",

      "The case is: A young adult nonsmoker patient with a history of asthma presented with a palpable mass on the left side of the neck that had been present for several months, reportedly unchanged. The patient had been treated presumptively for infection with antibiotics, with no improvement. No fever, odynophagia, dysphagia, otalgia, or other constitutional symptoms were reported. Physical examination findings demonstrated a palpable, soft, nontender left level II/III neck mass. Clinical examination findings of the thyroid and upper aerodigestive tract were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) showed a large avidly enhancing mass centered at the left carotid bifurcation splaying the internal and external carotid arteries and extending cranially along the cervical internal carotid artery. The left internal jugular vein was displaced posteriorly. There was also a smaller mass with similar appearance at the right carotid bifurcation (Figure 1A). Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed several enhancing masses in the liver (not shown). Based on CT findings, gallium Ga 68 (68Ga) dotatate positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed; results demonstrated intense radiotracer avidity in bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions (Figure 1B).A, Axial contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) demonstrates large left (black asterisk) and small right (white arrowhead) avidly enhancing bilateral carotid space masses. The left tumor circumferentially encases the left external carotid artery (black arrowhead) and partially encases the left internal carotid artery (yellow arrowhead).\n",

      "The case is: A 6-month-old infant presented with a congenital papule that had been growing proportionally in size to the infant since birth (Figure 1). No associated pain or pruritus was noted, and the papule had never bled or produced other fluid or debris. The infant had no other congenital anomalies and had been meeting all major developmental milestones. On clinical examination, a superficial, white-yellow papule was identified on the anterior surface of the neck, situated at the midline superior to the sternal notch. It measured 6 mm in diameter and was not associated with overlying surface changes or evident discharge. Dermoscopy results showed scattered telangiectatic vessels over the papule, accentuated peripherally.A smooth, subcutaneous papule with a yellow tint is present above the suprasternal notch and exposed with retraction of skinfolds of the anterior neck.Ultrasonography was performed to further characterize the papule, and imaging results exhibited a superficial cutaneous lesion without evidence of tracking into deeper layers of subcutaneous tissue or fluid collection.\n",

      "The case is: A child presented with multiple, asymptomatic, scattered white macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area, which were present at birth and had gradually increased in size and number. Physical examination revealed multiple, well-demarcated, hypopigmented 1- to 5-mm macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area (Figure, A and B). There was no history of any systemic disorder and no family history of similar lesions. Direct microscopic examination of scales soaked in potassium hydroxide did not reveal hyphae. Wood light examination revealed no accentuation. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained for further evaluation (Figure, C and D).A, Multiple discrete hypopigmented macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area. B, Well-demarcated hypopigmented macules on the lower abdomen. C, Histopathological examination revealed mild hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and scattered clear cells in the epidermis (hematoxylin-eosin).\n",

      "The case is: A young child presented to clinic with a 6-month history of an asymptomatic expanding erythematous eruption on the lower legs, abdomen, and buttocks (Figure, A). The eruption would wax and wane, with each episode lasting for approximately 1 week, without residual pigmentation. Clinical examination was significant for faint, nonscaling annular serpiginous, erythematous plaques with central clearing, and barely elevated borders. Test results for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood cell count, antinuclear antibodies, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies, and Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies were within normal limits. There was no family history of autoimmune disease, and the child had not experienced any fevers or exposures to ticks or other arthropods. A punch biopsy specimen from the left thigh was obtained, and histopathological analysis was subsequently performed (Figure, B and C).A, Annular serpiginous plaques with areas of central clearing on the patient’s right thigh and buttocks. B and C, Histopathologic images (hematoxylin-eosin). B, Perivascular and inflammatory infiltrate.\n",

      "The case is: An adult patient with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus and cystic fibrosis was seen with painless, rapidly declining vision in both eyes of 1-month duration. The patient had initially seen a general ophthalmologist 1 week after noticing a change in vision and was diagnosed as having bilateral cataracts. Given a continued decline in vision over the next 2 weeks, the patient sought a second opinion. The patient reported taking 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate daily (6.3 mg/kg/d) during the past 2 years, with normal renal function, but denied any recent change in medications.On initial examination, visual acuity (VA) was counting fingers at 2 ft OD and at 3 ft OS. Intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Pupils were equal and mildly sluggish to react to light but demonstrated no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slitlamp examination revealed 1+ nuclear sclerosis cataracts. Dilated fundus examination demonstrated normal-appearing retinal and optic nerve architecture with the exception of mild arteriolar narrowing bilaterally (Figure 1A). Results of optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retinal nerve fiber layer and macula, as well as fundus autofluorescence, were normal (Figure 1B).\n",

      "The case is: A child younger than 10 years presented with an 8-week history of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy unresponsive to a 10-day course of Augmentin (GlaxoSmithKline). The patient’s parents denied any associated fevers, chills, night sweats, sore throat, abdominal pain, or weight changes. Medical history was noncontributory.Physical examination showed bilateral, mobile, nontender cervical lymphadenopathy without erythema or swelling. Tonsils were symmetric and not enlarged. There was no noticeable thyromegaly or nodules. Laboratory testing was significant for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (37 mmol/h). Ultrasonography demonstrated cervical lymphadenopathy bilaterally with the largest node measuring 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. Lymph node needle core biopsy demonstrated increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells on tissue section (Figure, A). Scattered neutrophils and rare giant cells were also present. Findings of Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast, and Warthin-Starry stains were negative. The CD-68 immunostain showed numerous histiocytes. The specimen stained positive for CD-30 and S-100 immunostains showing emperipolesis (Figure, B and C). Findings of a CD1a stain were negative. Lymphoid markers by flow cytometry showed a polyclonal mixed B-cell and T-cell population.Lymph node needle core biopsy specimens from the patient. A, Evident are increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells (original magnification × 10). B, Numerous histiocytes with emperipolesis (original magnification × 40).\n",

      "The case is: A 35-year-old white head and neck surgeon with an unremarkable medical history was referred to the Surgical Emergency Department for a phlegmon of the flexor tendon sheath of the right hand. The lesion progressively developed several days after an unintentional exposure to blood with a blade used to drain an abscess of the oral cavity. The patient presented a deep wound induced by the bistoury piercing of the index finger pulp of the right hand, with a disrupted epidermal barrier. Both the patient who was operated on and the surgeon were negative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B/C virus testing. A soft tissue abscess of the digit appeared 7 days after the initial trauma. Antibiotic therapy combining amoxicillin and clavulanate was started, without any significant improvement. Surgery was performed urgently, with excision of the wound entrance and washing of the flexor tendon sheath. Bacteriological swabs were performed in the same time. An antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate was prescribed. Forty-eight hours after surgery, pustules appeared. Further drainage and washing of the sheath were repeated (Figure, A). The bacteriological samples were found to be sterile. The surgeon was hospitalized for infusions combining piperacillin/tazobactam and teicoplanine, carried out over 72 hours. An oral antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate (3 g every 24 hours) was prescribed for 10 additional days. The lesions completely resolved within 2 weeks. One year later, the surgeon presented with prodromal burning pain of the same index finger, and a similar soft tissue abscess recurred after 48 hours at the same site of the original lesion with a small painful vesicle progressively developed (Figure, B).A, Clinical aspect of the index finger 2 days after the second surgery.\n",

      "The case is: An ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure was performed for a neonate born by cesarean delivery at 37 weeks of gestation with a prenatally diagnosed neck mass. Initial laryngoscopy with a Parsons laryngoscope identified airway deviation secondary to mass effect, with intubation ultimately achieved with assistance of a bronchoscope. Examination revealed a large neck mass extending from the mandible to the clavicles, with mass effect causing neck extension and rotation. The mass was multicystic, with prominent vasculature, and a small area of skin necrosis. Following birth, the mass continued to grow, with inability to palpate the sternal notch by day of life 4 (Figure, A). The patient underwent a magnetic resonance image (MRI) on day of life 3 which showed a 15.7 × 10.0 × 14.4-cm midline neck mass with solid and cystic components. Flow voids were present throughout the mass. The mass was isointense to hypointense on T1, and isointense to hyperintense on T2. The patient also underwent a computed tomographic (CT) scan, which demonstrated calcifications present within the multicystic neck mass. Owing to continued growth and risk of airway compromise, the patient was taken to the operating room on day 5 of life for resection of the mass and tracheostomy.\n",

      "The case is: A man in his 30s with AIDS presented with acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). The patient also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to his significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection. For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed by scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and scraping its base with a #15 blade. These contents were placed on a glass slide, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa and subsequently Papanicolaou staining to further characterize the changes seen.A, Clinical image demonstrating papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the elbows.\n",

      "Case 2 of 1110\n",
      "The case is: A 68-year-old man presented with progressive right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches. His symptoms began 5 years earlier with right temple numbness, which expanded to include the entire right face and mouth. He then developed progressive right facial weakness with a droop, slurred speech, and eyelid ptosis. Finally, binocular vertical and horizontal diplopia and periorbital headaches began. Trials of gabapentin and steroids provided no relief. His history was significant for a left cheek melanoma completely excised years prior, numerous cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck removed without issue, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. His medications included metformin and simvastatin; he had no history of smoking or drinking.On examination, he had right-sided ptosis and severe right facial weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern with temporal wasting. The right pupil was fixed and dilated. There was no afferent pupillary defect. The left pupil was appropriately sized and reactive. His right-sided vision was impaired (20/250) with blurriness. Vertical and horizontal binocular diplopia was present. Right extraocular movements were significantly limited in all directions and painful, and right-sided facial sensation was diminished to pinprick in all cranial nerve (CN) V distributions. His speech was slightly slurred. Left-sided extraocular movements were intact. His left facial sensation was intact to pinprick, and his strength was without deficit. There were no other neurological abnormalities.Initial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were unremarkable. A biopsy of CN VII was nondiagnostic. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.8%. Tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed mildly elevated protein values.\n",

      "Case 3 of 1110\n",
      "The case is: A 28-year-old woman presented with a 5-day history of painful cervical lymphadenopathy along with fever, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids was started, without improvement of symptoms. She denied recent travel, sick contacts, or autoimmune disease. Her medical history was significant for α-thalassemia but otherwise noncontributory.On examination, she had tender lymphadenopathy involving right level V. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed a collection of enlarged, matted nodes without evidence of an abscess. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed nondiagnostic reactive lymph nodes. She was subsequently admitted to the hospital, where the lymphadenopathy progressed to the left side of the neck and a skin eruption developed over her face, back, and trunk. Results of an infectious disease and rheumatological workup, including bone marrow biopsy, were negative. Given her persistent symptoms, the ear, nose, and throat service consulted for excisional biopsy.On pathologic examination, the lymph nodes showed extensive coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris (Figure 1).\n",

      "Case 4 of 1110\n",
      "The case is: A woman in her 90s presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fever, hemoptysis, and syncopal episodes. She had a history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules with biopsy findings negative for metastatic disease but positive for granulomatous inflammation. Initial vital signs included blood pressure of 103/66 mm Hg, heart rate of 190 bpm, and temperature of 38.7 °C. Electrocardiogram showed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular (RV) origin (Figure 1). In addition to receiving intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride, she had correction of mild hypokalemia (3.1 mEq/L [reference range, 3.5-5.2 mEq/L]; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0). Successful arrhythmia termination occurred shortly thereafter, and her vital signs remained stable. Chest computed tomographic angiography excluded pulmonary embolism but showed pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy that had progressed compared with her previous computed tomography.\n",

      "Case 5 of 1110\n",
      "The case is: A 27-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician with primary complaints of headaches and visual-spatial difficulties when driving at night. In addition, the patient described a progressively enlarging lesion on her left scalp, which she had initially noted in high school. She denied any overlying loss of hair, sharp pain, or bleeding from the scalp lesion, and she only reported pain with prolonged pressure. On her scalp examination, a 7-cm ill-defined spongy and pulsatile mass was noted with an overlying gray patch of hair. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain/orbit was initially performed (Figure, A and B), which demonstrated an ill-defined, diffuse, intensely enhancing scalp lesion in the left frontoparietal region with very prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening. No osseous destruction or intracranial extension was present. Subsequent catheter angiography (Figure, C) confirmed the hypervascular mass, supplied via hypertrophied superficial temporal and occipital arteries with marked internal vascularity without direct involvement of the calvarium or intracranial structures. The patient underwent biopsy under general anesthesia; the specimen showed an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The lesions stained positive for S100 and SOX10 immunostains.Coronal T2-weighted (A) and postcontrast T1-weighted (B) fat-saturated images show the large left T2 hyperintense scalp lesion (double arrowheads; A and B), with underlying calvarial thickening (asterisk; A and B) without invasion, prominent vascularity (single arrowhead; A), and enhancement (B). Note the preservation of the overlying skin. Catheter angiography (C) shows the hypervascular scalp lesion being supplied by hypertrophied branches arising from the left superficial temporal and occipital arteries, with marked internal vascularity (arrowheads).\n",

      "Case 6 of 1110\n",
      "The case is: A woman in her 30s presented for evaluation of asymptomatic erythematous scaly plaques over the face and proximal extremities. The lesions started as an erythematous papule on the face, which had progressed to larger plaques within 10 years. There was involvement of the upper respiratory tract, causing palatal perforation and stridor, necessitating a tracheostomy a year ago. In addition, there was history of wheezing and breathlessness. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, malaise, joint pain, cough, epistaxis, hemoptysis, or hematuria.Examination revealed multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring measuring 2 × 1 to 8 × 7 cm on the face, arm, and thighs. The patient also had saddle nose deformity, perforation of the hard palate, and necrotic plaques on the ear, causing destruction of ear cartilage (Figure, A and B). There was cervical lymphadenopathy: multiple, nontender, discrete nodes, ranging from 1.5 to 2 cm without any surface changes. The results of sensory examination and peripheral nerve examination were within normal limits. Respiratory examination and chest radiography results were normal. Hemogram showed anemia (hemoglobin, 10.1 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]); the results of a kidney function test, a liver function test, a fasting blood glucose test, and routine urinalysis were within normal limits. Serologic analysis results for HIV-1/2, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Punch skin biopsy was obtained for histopathologic analysis and culture (Figure, C).A, Multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring, saddle nose deformity, and necrotic lesions on the ear with loss of ear cartilage.

      "The case is: A 64-year-old man with a 2-year history of seizure disorder presented to the emergency department (ED) at an outside hospital with breakthrough seizures. One month prior to his ED visit, he had been treated with oral antibiotics when he presented to an urgent care center with left-sided otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss. In the ED, he denied headaches, fever, otalgia, otorrhea, or hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast showed diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process with adjacent dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion. He received intravenous vancomycin and cefepime and was started on a heparin drip before being transferred to our facility. On presentation at our facility, the patient appeared well with normal vital signs. There was no periauricular swelling or erythema. Otoscopic examination showed no inflammation of the external auditory canals, and the tympanic membranes were translucent without evidence of retraction or effusion. Computed tomographic venogram confirmed occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses, and computed tomography of the temporal bone showed coalescence of mastoid air cells with erosion into the sigmoid sinus. Mastoidectomy was performed for biopsy and culture specimens. Histologic findings from the specimens demonstrated cells with oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm arranged in syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications (Figure, A).\n",

      "Case 8 of 1110\n",
      "The case is: A 62-year-old healthy man with no recent travel history or sick contacts presented with 2 weeks of midline sore throat without systemic signs, such as fever, myalgia, or rash. A physical examination, including flexible laryngoscopy, revealed cobbling, adherent, thick yellow mucus and ulceration of the uvula (Figure 1A).A, Nasopharyngoscopic imaging revealed infected nasal surface of uvula. B, Physical examination showed recurrent skin lesions at incision site and in the surrounding skin.Empirical treatment with augmentin and nystatin oral suspension for possible bacterial or fungal pharyngitis was unsuccessful, with symptoms worsening during the subsequent 2 weeks. Results of laboratory testing for group A Streptococcus, COVID-19, and mononucleosis were negative. A tissue biopsy was performed, and results of pathology revealed epithelial hyperplasia with suppurative granulomatous inflammation without evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. There was no evidence of fungal or acid-fast organisms. Tissue culture revealed only normal respiratory flora. Additional treatment with fluconazole, augmentin, doxycycline, omeprazole, prednisone, and bactrim failed to improve symptoms.Further exploration of the patient’s history revealed that 5 years earlier, he had traveled to Guyana in South America. After that trip, he sought medical care for multiple neck subcutaneous nodules as well as for a 4-cm focus of neck cellulitis. After failed treatment with empirical antibiotics, the largest lesion was excised. Findings of pathologic testing revealed dense granulomatous inflammation. However, results of stains for bacteria, fungus, and acid-fast bacillus were negative (Figure 1B).\n",

      "Case 9 of 1110\n",
      "The case is: A 33-year-old man with no prior ocular problems presented to the emergency department in central Florida with a chief complaint of a “pulling and popping” sensation in his left eye that had occurred the previous night. Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye. At the time of the examination, his symptoms had resolved; however, he had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. He reported a similar sensation of movement in his left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which he visited an urgent care center where he was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. He also reported recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. He had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph. His uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20, extraocular movements were full and without pain or abnormal sensation, and intraocular pressure was normal.\n",

      "Case 10 of 1110\n",
      "The case is: A 13-year-old boy with a history of sports-related blunt trauma to the left eye was referred for evaluation of an asymptomatic, pigmented iris lesion in the left eye. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes. Results of slitlamp examination of the right eye were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of the left eye revealed a round, pigmented lesion measuring 3 × 3 mm in basal dimension and with gravitational shifting within the anterior chamber fluid with patient head tilt (Video).

Her symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that she developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention.Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which she was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea.Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C).

He had no medical history or family history of cancer and was not a smoker. In the absence of other suggestive symptoms, as well as a normal physical examination that did not reveal any enlarged cervical lymph nodes or oropharyngeal or neck mass and an unremarkable nasoendoscopic examination, a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made. The patient was advised to try conservative management with dietary advice and proton pump inhibitors, and a clinical review was scheduled in 6 weeks. The patient only returned 3 months later when his hoarseness became worse. Repeat nasoendoscopy now showed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. In the absence of a history of trauma and associated neurological or systemic symptoms, the main concern was an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve at various points or its recurrent branch. Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear.\n",

      "The case is: A 16-year-old female complained of an olfactory disorder since birth. She had a history of a laryngeal tracheoesophageal fissure, intestinal hernia, and hearing loss because of an ossicular malformation. From age 10 years, she was unable to catch up with conversation of curry smell. Olfactory tests were performed, and T&T olfactometry1 results showed severe hyposmia (5.4/5.4; detection threshold/odor recognition threshold). On the card-type odor identification test, Open Essence,2 she only identified menthol correctly. Her Self-Administered Odor Questionnaire3 score was 20%. Her visual analog scale4 score was 10 for odor but 100 for taste. There were no unusual nasal findings on endoscopy or computed tomography. Because we suspected a congenital olfactory disorder, we recommended magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed olfactory bulb (OB) atrophy (Figure, A).A, Coronal short-tau inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the olfactory bulb shows that the olfactory fissure remains aerated, but the olfactory bulb is slightly atrophied on both sides (arrowheads). There were no dysplastic signs in the frontal gyri. B and C, An axial MRI T2-weighted image of the pelvis shows vaginal defects and bilateral 1 layer–differentiated uterine rudiments (arrowheads) that were 35 mm on the left and 37 mm on the right. Both ovaries are normal (equivalent to Mullerian duct anomaly class I).The patient also confirmed that she had not started menstruating. After consulting the pediatric department, an endocrine test was performed. The results showed an atypical reaction to the insulin tolerance test. However, the results for adrenocorticotropic hormone/cortisol corticotropin-releasing hormone load test, diurnal variation, and urine accumulation were normal. The luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) values were normal as determined by LH-releasing hormone load tests. She was subsequently referred to the gynecology department.\n",

The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during her infancy. At age 2 years, her parents noticed that she had delayed motor and language milestones. She experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and she became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. She was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video).

Following an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month prior, he developed disseminated red, scaly patches and a progressive eruption of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches of skin. He had occasional nonbloody loose stools but no fevers or vomiting. Although he was otherwise well, his growth had fallen from the 75th to the 25th percentile for height and weight over the preceding 9 months, and he could speak only 2 words. His medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis and diarrhea in infancy that prompted allergy testing at age 6 months; he was subsequently diagnosed with milk, egg, and peanut allergies. His parents avoided feeding him these foods, providing him only soy-based milk and formula, with improvement of dermatitis, until age 1 year. Since then his diet had consisted of multiple rice milk feeds daily, supplemented only with pureed fruits and vegetables, pasta, snack puffs, and sunflower butter. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or family history of cystic fibrosis. There was no recent travel and no changes to the home environment.On presentation, the patient was irritable, with normal vital signs.

Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness.

      "The case is: A 71-year-old man with no history of smoking was referred to our tertiary center in August 2018 for an asymptomatic left level 5 neck mass that had been present for 6 months. Biopsy of the mass demonstrated metastatic p16-positive (human papillomavirus [HPV]-related) squamous cell carcinoma. Examination revealed a large left base of tongue mass filling the vallecula. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an enhancing mass within the left base of tongue and bilateral cervical adenopathy. The patient was treated with concurrent radiation therapy and cetuximab, completing treatment without breaks in November 2018. His 3-month posttreatment fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) imaging results demonstrated resolution of the activity at the base of tongue mass and the involved cervical lymph nodes, consistent with complete treatment response.In July 2019, the patient presented with a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node. Restaging FDG-PET/CT demonstrated avid supraclavicular and anterolateral neck adenopathy. Additionally, there was moderately intense activity isolated to the left thyroid lobe. Ultrasonography of the thyroid demonstrated a 4-cm mass within the gland, and subsequent biopsy was performed with immunohistochemistry staining positive for p16, CK5, and p40 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) (Figure, A, B). After multidisciplinary review of the case, the patient was offered salvage left modified radical neck dissection and total thyroidectomy.

The patient noted an elevated blood pressure and took clonidine hydrochloride without effect, so he called emergency medical services. His chest pressure resolved after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin en route to the emergency department. On arrival, his blood pressure was 222/120 mm Hg, which subsequently normalized with administration of his home regimen for hypertension. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a preexisting left bundle-branch block. The troponin I level was initially undetectable but subsequently peaked at 1.3 ng/mL (conversion to micrograms per liter is 1:1). A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function with regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of ischemia in the area supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory the following day for further management of his non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.Coronary angiography revealed a high-grade distal left main coronary artery (LM) bifurcation lesion extending predominantly into the LAD (Figure 1A); the remainder of his coronary tree showed no evidence of obstructive disease. Given the patient’s low SYNTAX (synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] with taxus and cardiac surgery) score and preference to avoid surgery, he underwent transradial PCI of the LM-LAD using a provisional approach for the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX). Following initial angioplasty, the patient abruptly became hypotensive without chest discomfort despite quick balloon inflations and robust thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 3 flow down both the LAD and LCX. There was no evidence of coronary dissection or perforation. The LM-LAD was quickly stented (Figure 1B) as intravenous fluids and escalating doses of intravenous dopamine hydrochloride and epinephrine drips were administered. Unfortunately, his blood pressure continued to rapidly decline, and he experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest.\n",

He reported throat tightness after significant voice use and consistent voice roughness that worsened over several weeks. On examination, he had moderate to severe dysphonia with predominant roughness and strain. Videostroboscopy findings were consistent with fungal laryngitis; a 2-week course of fluconazole was administered. Follow-up videostroboscopy findings demonstrated resolution of the fungal laryngitis but revealed residual fullness of the left false vocal fold and appearance of prolapsed ventricular mucosa obstructing the lateral extent of the left true vocal fold. There was a reduction of lateral excursion of the mucosal wave on the left. The patient continued to report dysphonia and increased vocal effort. A computed tomography scan with contrast showed no specific abnormalities. A direct laryngoscopy for evaluation and treatment was planned. Intraoperatively, there was a firm lesion in the left paraglottic space extending to the lateral aspect of the true vocal fold (Figure, A). A subtle but similar finding was seen on the right true vocal fold, not causing any mass effect (Figure, B). An incision was made in the mucosa of the ventricle overlying the lesion at its lateral extent, and a mucosal flap was elevated over the lesion. This revealed a cartilaginous lesion, which was removed using an AcuBlade CO2 laser (Lumenis) and cup forceps until the cartilaginous edge was smooth within the paraglottic space (Figure, C and D). The histologic specimen showed fragments of cartilage with no nuclear atypia or mitosis (Figure, E and F).\n",

During the surgical procedure, the surgeon noted a significant amount of submucosal tissue in the right nasal cavity, which was removed; histopathological analysis was performed, and the results were reported as fibroadipose tissue and vascular proliferation. A skin biopsy was performed at the time of the surgical procedure and was interpreted as sebaceous hyperplasia. The patient initially had improvement in her skin, but she again noticed enlargement of the soft tissue with thickening of the overlying skin on her right cheek and right side of her nose several months later.Clinical examination revealed slightly hyperplastic soft tissue with dilated patulous follicles involving the right medial malar cheek and right nasal ala in addition to deviation of the nasal tip (Figure, A).

      "The case is: A 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts.The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness.On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house.\n",

Ten years later, he developed a second primary tumor in the hypopharynx requiring total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection. He presented with new-onset headaches, left ear pain, and persistent unsteadiness during the previous month. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy, neurological deficits, or mastoid tenderness, and otoscopic examination results of the tympanic membrane appeared normal.Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed an enhancing lesion in the left infratemporal fossa (3.4 × 3.4 × 2.8 cm) abutting the cerebellum, and subsequent computed tomographic imaging of the head demonstrated osseous destruction of the left temporal bone extending along the left internal jugular vein (Figure, A). Fine-needle aspiration of the left mastoid showed atypical spindle cells. The patient underwent tumor excision with a left infratemporal approach. A large mass with rubbery texture was noted, extending into the jugular foramen and adherent to the dura mater without evidence of intradural invasion. The lower cranial nerves were identified, and the mass was resected to the external wall of the jugular bulb. The patient tolerated the procedure without complications or neurological deficits.

The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. She believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until she developed an upper respiratory infection. Her physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. She was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. She also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size.Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to presentation at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s otolaryngology clinic. The scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space (Figure, A). Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull.

Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated extensive infiltrative stranding from the thorax through the retroperitoneal space. Sclerotic changes in multiple osseous structures were noted. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis was diagnosed following biopsies. Prednisone and azathioprine were started. Biopsy of the lower-eyelid yellow plaque returned xanthelasma (Figure, A). Ureteral obstruction, chronic kidney disease, and lymphedema complicated her course. Azathioprine was stopped after 1 year. Prednisone was slowly tapered but she relapsed 3 years later. A second retroperitoneal biopsy exhibited fibroadipose tissue, foamy macrophages, and chronic inflammation with fibrosis. Azathioprine and prednisone were restarted. She required multiple surgeries for spinal stenosis and ureteral obstruction. Her kidney function continued declining. Then, owing to knee pain, a plain radiograph was obtained which demonstrated osteosclerosis of the distal femur. Consequently, the previous eyelid and retroperitoneal biopsies were reviewed.

Each episode of joint pain and cutaneous eruption lasted 24 to 48 hours with episodes occurring anywhere from every other day to once weekly. The patient’s mother was unable to identify any possible triggers because the episodes occurred independent of pulmonary CF exacerbations or antibiotic use. The patient’s joint pain and cutaneous symptoms resolved completely between each episode and were not associated with fever.

Her OCD symptoms consisted of concerns about dirt or germs and fears that she or others would get sick because of spreading these contaminants. She had extensive rituals involving washing her hands repeatedly and cleaning household items. She reported, “I wash everything anyone else touches…I hardly let anyone into our home, and if I do, I wash down furniture and often have to wash the floors.” She avoided handling groceries, mail, and money and would not visit with family members owing to concerns that they were contaminated.She had experienced OCD symptoms since age 10 years but did not formally receive a diagnosis until 10 years later. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) resulted in little benefit even at maximum doses (eg, 400 mg of fluvoxamine daily, 200 mg of sertraline daily). A trial of clomipramine up to 250 mg daily also failed to reduce her OCD symptoms. Augmentation trials of antipsychotic medications, including risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole, were either ineffective or intolerable.In addition to OCD, she experienced periods of depression but denied any history of mania, psychosis, trauma, or substance abuse.

      "The case is: A man in his 30s presented with a slow-growing mass in the upper lip that had developed over several years. He had no history of underlying medical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, and tuberculosis. On physical examination, a whitish, firm, painless, nodular mass on the superficial layer of the left upper lip was observed (Figure, A). Given the possibility of a tumorous lesion, complete excision was planned under local anesthesia. In surgery, the 1.5 × 1.2 cm, whitish, firm, nodular, and well-encapsulated mass was excised completely without rupture of the capsule from the surrounding mucosa. On histopathologic examination, an encapsulated salivary gland tumor with epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and mixed stroma was observed (Figure, B). One month after surgery, the surgical wound on the left upper lip was clean and well healed. One year later, there had been no recurrence, and the patient had no symptoms at the left upper lip.A, Clinical image of the left upper lip.\n",

Slitlamp examination revealed a small, nasal corneal scar, a small iris defect, iris heterochromia, and a cataract with overlying pigment (Figure 1A). Dilated funduscopic examination of the left eye demonstrated vitritis and a hazy view of the retina due to the opacity of the media. A color fundus photograph of the eye showed opacity of the media secondary to the cataract and vitritis and a slightly pale optic nerve. Fluorescein angiography (Figure 1B) demonstrated early hyperfluorescence of an inferotemporal chorioretinal lesion that increased slightly during the course of the study, consistent with possible leakage. There were multiple hypofluorescent dots throughout the retina and an appearance of segmentation of the vessels with slightly decreased venous filling and late staining. A computed tomography scan of the eye and orbit revealed a hyperdense foreign body located along the inferior aspect of the vitreous, approximately at the 5 o'clock position, abutting the retinal surface.

Wound culture samples were sent for analysis, and she was given empirical intravenous clindamycin hydrochloride. Dermatology was consulted. On examination, the baby was alert and healthy appearing, although her sclerae were icteric. The vertex of her scalp was uniformly boggy, soft, and edematous, extending beyond suture lines, consistent with a diagnosis of caput succedaneum. On the right occiput, there was a mat of hair and thick serosanguineous crust adhering to the scalp (Figure 1A). Beneath the mat and extending laterally in both directions was a deep, 8 × 1-cm, trenchlike ulcer with no drainage (Figure 1B). It was nontender to palpation.A, Serosanguineous crust adhering to occipital scalp of a neonate. Prior to removing this crust it was being treated as an open ulcer.\n",

Nasal obstruction was constant and associated with right paranasal pressure. Results from a head and neck examination, including cranial nerve, were normal, except for the results from nasal endoscopy, which showed a deviated septum and a soft-tissue mass emanating from the right middle meatus inferior to the middle turbinate that seemed to have a polypoid appearance superiorly and a papillomatous appearance inferiorly. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the sinuses without contrast showed complete opacification of the right paranasal sinuses with mass effect on the medial maxillary wall with mild hyperostosis posterolaterally. The patient underwent an endoscopic right sinonasal mass biopsy. Intraoperatively, further excision of the mass was aborted owing to an unusual appearance of the mass as well as clear fluid exuding from the mass during microdebridement. Pathologic analysis of the biopsied tissue revealed a uniform spindle cell tumor comprised of cellular fascicles and tumor cells with bland nuclei (Figure, A and B).

He had no history of fevers or other constitutional symptoms. Physical examination demonstrated a 3-cm firm and tender right parotid mass. Clear saliva could be expressed from the Stensen duct. A computed tomographic (CT) scan was performed, showing a discrete 2 × 2-cm necrotic mass in the right parotid gland (Figure, A). A fine-needle aspirate (FNA) yielded a cellular sample with spindloid features, suggesting a neoplasm of uncertain subtype. A broad differential diagnosis was raised, including both benign and malignant salivary neoplasms. Per recommendation of the head and neck multidisciplinary tumor board, the patient underwent total parotidectomy and neck dissection because the mass was grossly infiltrative of the parotid, and several enlarged level IB and II lymph nodes were observed at the time of surgery. The mass was shaved off the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve because it was adherent to it.

Three days prior to this presentation, he experienced an episode of mild chest pain associated with radiation down his left arm and vomiting. He did not seek medical attention at that time as he felt the pain was unlikely to be coming from his heart. Over the preceding days, he developed progressive dyspnea on exertion, which prompted him to present to the emergency department. His electrocardiogram (ECG) on presentation is shown in Figure, A. His bedside echocardiogram showed anteroseptal akinesis with apical thrombus and reduced left ventricular function (Figure, B and Video).A, Patient’s admission electrocardiogram demonstrated new ST elevations of 1 to 2 mm in the anterolateral leads with Q waves in I, aVL, and across the precordial leads.\n",

His medical history was notable for allergic rhinitis and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The prior biopsy diagnosis from the area of swelling was inflammatory nasal polyp. Physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation over the right nasal bridge and mild right proptosis. Flexible and rigid nasal endoscopy demonstrated a right-sided exophytic mass visible between the middle turbinate and nasal septum. Computed tomography showed a large, right-sided mass centered in the ethmoid sinus with expansion into the anterior skull base, anterior cribriform plate, and right medial orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging showed vascularity in the lesion and early intracranial involvement with transdural spread but no evidence of invasion into the meninges or brain. The patient was taken for surgery, and findings from intraoperative frozen section analysis were consistent with a spindle cell neoplasm. Definitive skull base resection of the mass was deferred until final pathological diagnosis was obtained, given the morbidity with skull base resection. The final pathology report showed an infiltrative, low-grade, malignant spindle cell neoplasm with immunoreactivity for BCL2 protein and neural marker, S-100 protein, and focal immunoreactivity for smooth muscle markers SMA and HHF35 (Figure).

This change prompted a visit to an optometrist, who found a mild decrease in visual acuity and minor cataract in the right eye. His primary care physician diagnosed his ear pain as acute otitis media and prescribed a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate; however, the young man’s vision continued to deteriorate and became associated with the onset of right eye swelling and forehead tenderness. A repeat eye examination by an ophthalmologist was performed and showed normal peripheral visual acuity with a decrease in central vision and confirmed proptosis. The patient had not experienced nasal congestion, epistaxis, weight loss, fevers, or chills. Physical examination included right eye proptosis and restricted eye movement. A computed tomographic (CT) scan with contrast of the face showed a small relatively homogenous mass in the right anterior nasal cavity invading the right orbit, and a magnetic resonance image (MRI) with contrast showed a right superior nasal cavity mass, with invasion of the right orbit and right ethmoidal sinus with extension to the overlying soft-tissue scalp (Figure).

In the week following her first treatment, the patient reported a few mild morning headaches that improved with acetaminophen. After receiving 3 cycles of ipilimumab, 3 mg/kg, and nivolumab, 1 mg/kg, and 8 weeks after her first treatment, the patient reported experiencing daily headaches for at least the prior week and a half. The location of her headaches varied, and there was no associated eye or temple pain. At best, with taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the headache decreased to pain rated 3 on a scale of 1 to 10. Also at this time, the patient reported low energy levels and difficulty reading; however, physical examination showed no gross visual field defects. Laboratory workup conducted 8 weeks after initiating treatment included adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels that were measured at 25 pg/mL (reference range, 10-60 pg/mL) and 16.8 μg/dL (reference range, 6-24 μg/dL), respectively. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 0.82 mIU/L (reference range, 0.5-5.0 mIU/L), which was gradually decreasing compared with 1.41 mIU/L 5 weeks earlier and 1.21 mIU/L 2 weeks earlier. Her total triiodothyronine level was measured at 73 ng/dL (reference range, 80-200 ng/dL) and free thyroxine level was 1.0 ng/dL (reference range, 0.9-1.7 ng/dL).

He served in the military for 4 years, including a 6-month tour in Iraq. While in Iraq he worked as an assault vehicle operator and was involved in frequent foot patrols. He reported numerous traumatic experiences, including frequent receipt of incoming fire, multiple ambushes, and an explosion by an improvised explosive device (IED) that injured several fellow soldiers (see Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review).1He denied any psychiatric issues prior to his military service, but reported that since returning home “there ain’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about [these experiences].” The thoughts were highly distressing and he had frequent violent nightmares. He reported intense guilt relating to the belief that he should have detected the IED and been able to protect his colleagues. He reported a number of triggers (eg, walking down a city street; driving by a shooting range) that reminded him of his experiences in Iraq and induced panic-like symptoms (eg, fear, anxiety, racing heart, and feeling shaky). He avoided things that reminded him of these events and was reluctant to discuss his history (see Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review).1He felt numb and withdrawn from others, reported difficulty sleeping, and was always “on guard.” He startled easily and had angry outbursts. The patient was hopeless at times, but denied suicidal thoughts. He reported difficulty concentrating and had significant fluctuations in his weight. He denied mania, psychosis, or medical problems. He reported drinking more than 12 beers 2 to 3 times per week. He denied any other substance abuse history.The patient was briefly in outpatient treatment while he was still in the military.

There were no abnormal pigmented skin lesions on the rest of his body, including the face, trunk, and extremities. Neither a palpable thyroid nodule nor enlargement of hands and feet was identified. Surgical excision was performed. Gross total extirpation of the mass from the surrounding tissues was enabled by meticulous dissection. Intraoperatively, the 1-cm mass was noted to be gelatinous and glossy with well-demarcated and smooth border. It was attached to the posterior surface of the concha cartilage but easily separated using blunt dissection. Unexpectedly, low-viscosity mucoid fluid had smeared on the surface. The histopathological examination revealed the tumor to be overall hypocellular and composed of bland spindle cells with no mitotic activity in a slightly basophilic myxoid matrix (Figure, C). The surgical wound uneventfully healed, and no recurrence was noted during the 6-month follow-up period.A, Photograph of a protruding mass on the posterior surface of the auricle.

      "The case is: A well-developed man in his 20s presented to our hospital with a clinically significant elevation in serum calcium level to (14.1 mg/dL [reference range, 8.6-10.2 mg/dL]) found on routine laboratory tests. He was highly functional and denied abdominal pain, dysuria, anxiety, lethargy, and constipation. Findings from his physical examination were within normal limits. He did not have any palpable thyroid nodules or cervical lymphadenopathy. Given his elevated calcium level, parathyroid hormone (PTH) was drawn, and results returned significantly elevated at 1377 pg/mL (reference range, 10-65 pg/mL). Because of the extremely elevated PTH level, a technetium Tc 99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic/computed tomographic (SPECT/CT) scan was obtained, which identified a lesion in the location of the right inferior parathyroid gland, measured at 2.2 cm (Figure, A).

His parents noted intermittent stertor while he was sleeping but no apnea. He had no dysphagia or aspiration manifestations. He was overweight (body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, 27.2); breathed comfortably at rest; and had a dysphonic, breathy voice. Findings from an otolaryngologic examination were normal other than those from flexible laryngoscopy, which demonstrated 2 laryngeal lesions, 1 in the postcricoid interarytenoid region and 1 at the anterior commissure, the latter of which compromised vocal fold approximation. Vocal fold mobility otherwise appeared normal. Operative laryngoscopy confirmed a midline, firm, posterior cricoid mass (Figure, A), and a midline, firm, anterior subglottic mass extending into the anterior commissure (Figure, A). Tracheobronchoscopy revealed a distal tracheal submucosal mass partially obstructing the left mainstem bronchus (Figure, B). Excisional biopsy of the postcricoid and subglottic masses with the carbon dioxide laser was performed (Figure, C).

The patient elected to proceed with cataract extraction and a lens implant followed by canaloplasty. The cataract extraction and lens implant went routinely, but during the canaloplasty, a hard-stop obstruction was encountered at the 7-o’clock position during the passage of the illuminated catheter. A viscoelastic material was injected into the Schlemm canal to attempt to break the obstruction. This resulted in a large inferior nasal Descemet membrane detachment. A washout was not performed because of concerns of further exacerbating the detachment or inducing a hemorrhage. The procedure was aborted, a 50% air bubble was injected into the eye, and the physicians recommended that the patient maintain a face-up position. The patient had a persistent Descemet membrane detachment at the 1-day postoperative visit (Figure).

      "The case is: A man in his 30s presented with a 1-year history of recurrent episodes of unilateral high-pitched “clicking” in his right ear followed by vertigo that lasted 3 to 4 seconds. He reported no perceived association between these episodes and breathing and head position, and denied precipitation of symptoms with exposure to loud sound or pressure change. He had not experienced hearing loss, aural fullness, autophony, or headache. On physical examination, objective, intermittent, clicking tinnitus at a frequency of 1 click per second was noted on placement of a stethoscope in close proximity to the right ear. The tinnitus coincided temporally with the patient’s complaints but was nonsynchronous with pulse. Results from prior imaging including a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head with multiplanar reconstruction (Figure, A, C, and D), were normal. Steady state tympanometry showed mildly decreased compliance of the tympanic membrane when the patient reported hearing the clicking sensation. The patient was tentatively diagnosed as having tensor tympani and stapedius myoclonus and after discussion of treatment options, he decided to undergo middle ear exploration for muscle sectioning.

The procedure was uneventful and well tolerated. Her history of end-stage renal disease precluded postoperative radioactive iodine treatment. Ultrasonography performed at her 3-month follow-up showed no evidence of disease recurrence or local metastasis. Her compressive symptoms had also resolved. Ultrasonography revealed a 1.3 × 1.1 × 1.0-cm hypoechoic mass in the right central compartment and a suspicious lymph node in the right carotid sheath. Fine-needle aspiration confirmed recurrence of a malignant neoplasm in the central compartment; however, the lymph node was not amenable to sampling based on its anatomic location. The patient decided to undergo a right central (level VI) lymph node dissection. Intraoperatively, insular carcinoma was dissected away from the cricothyroid membrane and recurrent laryngeal nerve.

His medical and family history as well as review of other systems were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a positive Kussmaul sign and pulsus paradoxus but no cardiac murmurs. There was no pedal edema, clubbing, or cyanosis. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia. Results of a complete blood cell count and biochemical panel were within reference ranges. A chest radiograph revealed convexity on the right heart border suggestive of cardiomegaly (Figure 1A). Echocardiography demonstrated normal cardiac chambers and valves. However, an echogenicity was noted compressing the superior vena cava and right ventricle. The patient subsequently underwent computed tomographic imaging of the chest that revealed a large, 16.2 × 6.8 × 5.6-cm anterior mediastinal mass compressing the right cardiac structures, particularly the superior vena cava. The mass consisted mostly of fat attenuation, but was interspersed with nodular densities (Figure 1B).

The result of an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed at the referring institution was normal. A colonoscopy had been performed at the referring institution, but visualization was poor, with fresh blood and clots noted in the ascending colon. Endoscopic treatment of a right colon arteriovenous malformation with active bleeding was attempted. This was unsuccessful and bleeding persisted. The patient underwent urgent angiography and embolization of a right colic artery branch (Figure 1B). At angiography, no blush or bleeding vessel was evident. The decision to embolize the right colic branch was based on the endoscopic findings and the presence of pooling contrast in the cecum noted on a computed tomographic angiogram (Figure 1A) performed at the referring institution. He had no further bleeding episodes. Twenty hours after the procedure, he reported abdominal pain. Findings from computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis obtained at this time were unremarkable.\n",

The immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and she was weaned off oxygen support. On postoperative day 10, she developed seizures when walking and was immediately intubated. Brain imaging revealed a new intracerebral hemorrhage in the right frontal and left occipital lobes, with narrowing of the internal carotid, basilar, posterior cerebral, and right posterior communicating arteries, suggestive of vasospasm or vasculopathy. Subsequently, she developed hypoxemia and hypotension associated with acute pulmonary edema and new cardiomegaly (Figure 1A). An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST changes with T-wave inversion (Figure 1B), and serum levels of troponin and creatine phosphokinase were negative. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed new dilation of the left ventricle (LV), with an ejection fraction of 10%, functional mitral regurgitation, anterior and apical akinesis, and basal hypokinesis (Video 1, Video 2, and Video 3).

Physical examination revealed no palpable parotid mass and no overlying skin changes. Neurologic examination showed incomplete left eye closure with a grade 5 of 6 on the House-Brackmann scale. Treatment with steroids and antiviral agents marginally improved facial strength and allowed eye closure. Magnetic resonance imaging showed subcutaneous nodules focally infiltrating the superficial parotid gland with evidence of perineural spread along the labyrinthine segment of CN VII. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasonographic guidance was nondiagnostic. An open excisional biopsy demonstrated dense subcutaneous tissue overlying and invading the parotid gland. Intraoperative frozen section revealed a spindle cell tumor. A superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection and preservation was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed a subcutaneous mass with stellate extension into and around the parotid gland. The tumor consisted of bland fusiform tumor cells in a storiform pattern near inconspicuous hyalinized vessels (Figure, A and B). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated diffuse positivity for CD34 (Figure, C), positivity for bcl-2, and negativity for CD99 and S-100.

Examination revealed normal otoscopic findings, and an audiogram demonstrated moderate low-frequency CHL of 45 dB in the right ear and mild 30-dB CHL in the left ear with a normal tympanogram (Figure, A). Two sets of tympanostomy tubes were placed the year before his initial visit for presumed otitis media–related CHL, but his hearing did not improve. An axial computed tomographic (CT) scan performed at that time was interpreted as normal. Owing to concerns of visual changes and possible associated genetic cause for hearing loss (HL), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered 1 year after initial presentation and showed no central or peripheral otologic abnormalities. A genetic evaluation revealed no abnormalities. Follow-up audiograms at 3 and 6 months showed similar persistent CHL despite normal otoscopy results. The patient and family decided to treat the CHL with bilateral hearing aid amplification and a frequency modulation (FM) system at school. After 30 months of persistent CHL with an unknown etiology, a repeated CT scan of the temporal bones was performed (Figure, B and C). Operative intervention vs amplification was discussed, and the patient and family decided to continue with hearing aids because he had improved performance in school.

His medical history included hypertension and chronic rhinosinusitis. On oral endoscopic examination, mild bilateral hyperemia of the tonsillar area and posterior pharyngeal wall were noted. The base of tongue was normal. Fiber-optic laryngoscopy revealed a reddish, 2-cm supraglottic lesion involving medially the free margin of the suprahyoid epiglottis (Figure, A). The neoplasm appeared highly vascularized on narrowband imaging (Figure, B). For this reason, before attempting an incisional biopsy, contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The MRI scan revealed an oval, 2.2-cm hypervascular mass arising from the free border of the suprahyoid epiglottis, which extended along the right aryepiglottic fold. The mass appeared to be capsulated, with regular margins, and did not show laryngeal deep tissues invasion. We proposed to the patient a surgical excision that could have been transoral or open according to the quality of exposure (which would be evaluated in general anesthesia). After evaluating the optimal exposure using a Crowe-Davis retractor, a transoral excision using the da Vinci robotic system was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and patient did not develop complications.

The mass was seen to ball-valve in and out of the glottis with respiration. The position of the mass was discussed with the anesthesiology team, who felt comfortable performing prone intubation. Preparations for emergency tracheotomy were made. In the operating room, with the patient, the anesthesia unit performed flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy and advanced the endotracheal tube into the trachea over the flexible bronchoscope. A video laryngoscope was used to ensure that advancing the tube would not shear the mass. The patient was turned supine, and microdirect laryngoscopy was performed. The mass originated from a stalk in the left anterior ventricle. It was removed with microscissors. Pathologic examination (Figure, C and D) revealed a 1.7 × 1.3 × 1.0-cm mass with a papillary-like architecture, expansion of the submucosa by benign mature adipose tissue, and variable amount of fibrous tissue. There was mild chronic submucosal inflammation without squamous epithelial proliferation.A, Direct laryngoscopic image of mass. B, Direct laryngoscopy with retraction of mass to view stalk.

The left eye had undergone pars plana vitrectomy for the repair of a macula-involving tractional retinal detachment, but despite anatomical success, visual acuity remained count fingers, presumably due to a loss of retinal tissue from macular ischemia. The right eye had undergone cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation and a pars plana vitrectomy for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage. After this surgery, the patient was treated for persistent DME and received multiple intravitreous injections of bevacizumab, ranibizumab, triamcinolone acetonide, and a dexamethasone intravitreal implant, but the DME persisted, and visual acuity was 20/70 OU. Therefore, a fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant (ILUVIEN; Alimera Sciences Inc) was injected.

Initial laryngoscopy with a Parsons laryngoscope identified airway deviation secondary to mass effect, with intubation ultimately achieved with assistance of a bronchoscope. Examination revealed a large neck mass extending from the mandible to the clavicles, with mass effect causing neck extension and rotation. The mass was multicystic, with prominent vasculature, and a small area of skin necrosis. Following birth, the mass continued to grow, with inability to palpate the sternal notch by day of life 4 (Figure, A). The patient underwent a magnetic resonance image (MRI) on day of life 3 which showed a 15.7 × 10.0 × 14.4-cm midline neck mass with solid and cystic components. Flow voids were present throughout the mass. The mass was isointense to hypointense on T1, and isointense to hyperintense on T2. The patient also underwent a computed tomographic (CT) scan, which demonstrated calcifications present within the multicystic neck mass.

      "The case is: A woman in her 50s with a history of ulcerative colitis presented with severe diffuse sore throat associated with fevers, chills, night sweats, and neck swelling of 2 weeks’ duration. Results from a rapid strep test were negative, and observation was initiated for presumed viral pharyngitis. Progression of neck swelling led to empirical treatment for bacterial pharyngitis. A neck computed tomographic scan with contrast revealed large bilateral asymmetric conglomerations of necrotic cervical lymph nodes measuring up to 9 cm in the greatest dimension (Figure, A). Four weeks after symptom onset, the patient was referred to the otolaryngology service. Initial evaluation, including fiber-optic laryngoscopy, revealed the presence of significant bilateral tender lymphadenopathy in the absence of any lesions in the upper aerodigestive tract. A core biopsy specimen yielded negative gram stain and aerobic and anaerobic bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacillus cultures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nodal contents was negative for Bartonella henselae. A chest radiograph was normal. Necrotic skin changes and persistent purulent neck drainage through the needle biopsy site required incision and drainage as well as incisional biopsy of the left side of her neck. Operative findings included abundant purulent debris and considerable necrosis of skin and neck musculature. All the cultures once again returned with no growth. Final pathologic examination showed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation (Figure, B) with no monoclonal lymphocyte population on flow cytometry. Results from a test for human immunodeficiency virus and angiotensin-converting enzyme testing were negative.\n",

He had no history of dysphagia and/or odynophagia, hoarseness, vision changes, dry mouth, decreased ipsilateral sweating, weight loss, fevers, chills, or a history of tobacco or alcohol use. Physical examination revealed a palpable nontender mass in the left parapharyngeal space. Cervical lymphadenopathy was not palpable. Nasopharyngoscopy revealed slight bulging of the lateral pharyngeal wall into the oropharynx with no discrete masses seen. Computed tomography–guided fine-needle aspiration biopsies were nondiagnostic. Axial T2-weighted MRI showed a lesion arising from the left parapharyngeal space, arising from the deep lobe of the parotid gland. The lesion caused loss of the fat plane between the parapharyngeal space and masticator space with subsequent inflammation of the pterygoid space. The pharyngeal mucosa of the left lateral pharyngeal wall was effaced owing to mass effect (Figure, A). The mass was surgically resected in its entirety. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed sections of confluent amorphous eosinophilic masses with surrounding foreign-body giant cell reaction and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates (Figure, B).

An ultrasonography (US)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed bland-appearing cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells arranged in clusters; no malignant cells were identified. Repeated US-guided FNA biopsy showed a hypercellular specimen composed of numerous fragments of bland-appearing cuboidal and columnar epithelium and granular debris, which was eosinophilic in cell block sections and papillary structures with fibrovascular cores. The hypercellularity was atypical, and a low-grade neoplasm could not be ruled out. At this point, the patient elected observation of the mass and a repeated biopsy. A core biopsy showed a well-differentiated papillary neoplasm with hyalinized fibrovascular cores and some degenerative changes (Figure, B-D).

His parents reported that he complained of left orbital pain just before they noticed the swelling, and he was treated with cold compresses with only slight improvement. He had never experienced these symptoms before. The patient had not experienced diplopia, change in visual acuity, nasal obstruction, change in oral intake, weight loss, recent upper respiratory infection, sick contacts, fevers, or chills. At the time of presentation, the patient was breathing comfortably and was afebrile. Findings from his head and neck examination were significant for a firm mass over the left zygoma and lateral infraorbital rim, 2 × 3 cm in diameter. The mass was nontender, nonerythematous, and fixed to the underlying zygoma and lateral infraorbital rim. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Ophthalmology examination revealed intact extraocular movements, bilateral visual acuity of 20/50, and no evidence of afferent papillary defect. Computed tomographic (CT) images showed a round, soft-tissue mass with osseous destruction and erosion into the zygoma, infratemporal fossa, inferolateral orbit, and maxillary sinus (Figure, A and B).

The patient is from India and arrived in the United States 1 month ago for graduate studies. She reports no significant medical history and is unaware of any tuberculosis (TB) exposures. She has no symptoms. She received the BCG vaccine as a child. Laboratory testing showed normal chemistry and hematology values and a negative HIV test. The TST reveals an induration of 20 mm. Because of the TST result, the patient has a chest radiograph performed, which was unremarkable. Treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) was recommended based on the positive TST, negative chest radiograph, and recent US arrival from a high-TB–incidence country. The patient asks whether the positive TST result could be due to her BCG vaccination and wants further testing before beginning therapy. Blood is drawn for an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA; see Figure for results).aExplanation of values: nil (the interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood incubated without antigen [negative control]); TB antigen minus nil (the interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood stimulated with 3 relatively specific TB peptides) minus nil; and mitogen minus nil (the interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood stimulated with mitogen minus nil). The mitogen tube contains a mitogen (phytohaemogglutin-P) that is a nonspecific stimulator of T-cells. It is used as a positive control to ensure the capacity to respond to antigens and also serves as a control for correct blood handling and incubation.bFor this IGRA, 1 mL of blood is drawn into each of 3 tubes (nil [negative control], mitogen [positive control], and TB antigens tube). The TB response (TB antigen minus nil) is calculated as the difference in interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood stimulated with TB antigens minus the interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood incubated without antigen (nil). A positive IGRA test result occurs when all of the following criteria are met: (1) the nil value is less than 8 IU/mL; (2) the TB antigen minus nil response is greater than or equal to both 0.35 IU/mL and 25% of the nil value; and (3) there is a positive mitogen response. Data are based on package insert available at http://www.quantiferon.com/irm/content/PI/QFT/2PK/US.pdf.cFor negative, positive, and indeterminate results, the probability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is not likely, likely, and uncertain, respectively.The patient does not have LTBI.\n",

Three months prior, he had an episode of native aortic valve endocarditis, necessitating aortic valve replacement with a pericardial bioprosthesis. He developed postoperative acute renal failure, which progressed to chronic renal failure requiring dialysis via tunneled catheter. On this admission, he was found to have methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a vegetation on his prosthetic aortic valve. He was diagnosed as having MRSA prosthetic valve endocarditis and admitted to the cardiovascular surgical intensive care unit prior to surgical intervention.In the setting of MRSA bacteremia, his tunneled dialysis catheter had been removed. Owing to his dialysis needs, a temporary dialysis catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein. As intravenous access was required for vasoactive medications and intravenous antibiotics, a triple-lumen central catheter was placed in the left internal jugular vein under ultrasonographic guidance. The catheter went in easily without resistance, was drop tested to confirm venous placement, and flushed and drew easily, and venous waveforms and pressures were transduced.

Shortly after the onset of the outbreak, the patient and all family members were treated with 2 once-weekly doses of permethrin, 5%, cream. All other family members had significant improvement with the treatment; however, our patient’s lesions continued to worsen during the subsequent 2 weeks. On physical examination, the patient had numerous erythematous macules, papules, and pustules on her back. Many of the lesions had superimposed hemorrhagic crust and surrounding scale. In addition, several grouped papules were noted, including some in a linear array (Figure 1A and B).\n",

Histopathological examination detected spindle cell infiltrates with hemorrhages, fragmented trabecular bone, and numerous osteoclastic giant cells proliferating at a rate of 10% suggesting an aggressive giant cell lesion.Since it was still not determined whether the lesions were malignant, flourodeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography/computed tomography was performed and found additional lesions in the left distal femur and the left mandible.\n",
