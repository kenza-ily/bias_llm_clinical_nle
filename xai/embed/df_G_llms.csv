4,"The differential diagnoses in young men with eosinophilia and a neck mass can be wide. The typical presentation of Kimura disease is a painless, unilateral swelling of cervical lymph nodes in young adult male patients with peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated immunoglobulin E levels.

Although Hodgkin lymphoma can present with eosinophilia and neck mass in young adults, the biopsy was inconsistent with the typical morphology of Reed-Sternberg cells in the background of nonneoplastic inflammatory cells.

One hypothesis is that chemotherapy drugs can trigger increased melanin deposition in the oral mucosa. The risk is thought to be higher in individuals of African descent.1,2 However, this adverse effect is underreported, and it is important for treating physicians to be familiar with this adverse effect to avoid unnecessary testing and undue stress to the patient.Doxorubicin is an anthracycline-based chemotherapy that is frequently used as a single agent or in combination therapy to treat various types of cancer, such as breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.3 Doxorubicin directly inhibits topoisomerase II, thereby preventing DNA synthesis.3 There are several formulations, including pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and nonliposomal conventional formulations.3 Single-agent pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is typically used for treatment of advanced mycosis fungoides.4 Although this is often an effective treatment option in cases of refractory and recalcitrant mycosis fungoides, it is also associated with several oral adverse effects, including mucositis, altered taste, and oral hyperpigmentation.5Doxorubicin-induced oral hyperpigmentation is a rare adverse effect that typically presents with multiple coalescing, painless black macules and patches on the tongue, roof of the mouth, and buccal mucosa.2,6,7 The hyperpigmented areas may be uniform in color or have a speckled appearance.2,6,7 These lesions are benign and do not cause any pain or discomfort.2,6,7 However, they may sometimes be accompanied by other oral mucosal changes associated with chemotherapy, such as candidiasis or mucositis.2,6,7 Oral hyperpigmentation usually occurs within the first few weeks of treatment, and it is usually reversible within a few months after discontinuation of doxorubicin.2,6,7Doxorubicin-induced tongue hyperpigmentation is usually a clinical diagnosis based on the patient’s history of chemotherapy and the characteristic appearance of the oral lesions.2,6,7 It is important to rule out other potential causes of oral hyperpigmentation, such as melanoma (choice B) or oral involvement of mycosis fungoides (choice D). Melanoma usually presents as a solitary, asymmetric, and irregularly shaped lesion, in contrast to the multiple black macules and patches seen in this patient.8 Oral involvement of cutaneous lymphoma is a rare complication; prior case reports describe flesh-colored or erythematous plaques and ulcerated nodules that are associated with global disease progression.9 Laugier-Hunziker syndrome (choice A) is a rare idiopathic condition that usually presents with nail hyperpigmentation in addition to mucosal pigmentation.10 This is a diagnosis of exclusion and would not resolve with cessation of medications.As doxorubicin-induced oral hyperpigmentation is benign and self-limiting, the inciting chemotherapy can be continued for treatment of the patient’s primary illness.

A fungal culture grew Fusarium solani.Fusarium species are ubiquitous in soil and air, and transmission occurs through inhalation or direct cutaneous inoculation from a contaminated source.1 Localized infections can present as onychomycosis, superficial cutaneous infections, and keratitis in immunocompetent hosts; invasive and disseminated disease is more common in those who are immunocompromised, particularly those with neutropenia.2 In those with hematologic cancer, disseminated fusariosis most frequently involves the skin, blood, lungs, and sinuses.3Although the incidence of fusariosis among patients undergoing hematopoietic transplant is less than 1%, invasive fusariosis has a mortality rate of approximately 80% in individuals with hematologic cancer.4 Thus, early recognition is crucial for prompt treatment of the infection. Purpuric patches or papulonodules in this population should be evaluated urgently with skin biopsy and tissue culture. It is also recommended that patients with hematologic cancer who are about to receive chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplant first undergo a thorough examination for skin findings of onychomycosis, which has been associated with Fusarium infections.1,3,5The patient’s physical examination findings of scattered and painful purpuric papulonodules are similar to those found in invasive aspergillosis, which has an incidence of 2.7% in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant.4 Invasive aspergillosis is an infection caused by the fungal Aspergillus species, which is ubiquitous in the environment.6 As transmission is primarily through inhalation, invasive aspergillus most commonly presents with pulmonary or sinus disease that can then progress to dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. Both Aspergillus and Fusarium may cause elevated serum galactomannan antigen. Chest CT findings of invasive aspergillosis and disseminated fusariosis are similar, and both may show ground-glass opacities, segmental consolidation, cavitary lesions, and the “halo sign” (ground-glass opacities representing hemorrhage surrounding central fungal nodules). Lactophenol cotton blue staining of mold colony can differentiate between the 2 pathogens, as Aspergillus species have septate hyphae and flask-shaped vesicles.1,7Ecthyma gangrenosum is a cutaneous infection caused by hematogenous spread of bacteria, most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It most frequently occurs in immunocompromised individuals, including those with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.8 As this represents bacterial angioinvasion, ecthyma gangrenosum presents as purpuric macules that may become pustular or bullous before progressing to ulcers with overlying eschar most commonly in the anogenital and axillary areas. In most cases, Pseudomonas can be detected from tissue specimens, but blood culture results are often negative.9Sweet syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a rare disorder that is commonly associated with hematologic cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia. Sweet syndrome can also be associated with other states, such as autoimmune disease, or be due to medications, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Classic Sweet syndrome presents as tender, erythematous, and edematous plaques associated with fever and leukocytosis. Cutaneous involvement generally does not show overlying eschar, as seen in disseminated fusariosis. Skin biopsy histopathologic features can mimic infection with dermal edema and a dense infiltrate of neutrophils; however, the results of infectious stains and tissue culture will be negative. Systemic corticosteroids are often first-line treatments for Sweet syndrome.10The patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin B and voriconazole for disseminated fusariosis, with resolution of her cutaneous lesions over the course of 6 weeks.

It is also recommended that patients with hematologic cancer who are about to receive chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplant first undergo a thorough examination for skin findings of onychomycosis, which has been associated with Fusarium infections.1,3,5The patient’s physical examination findings of scattered and painful purpuric papulonodules are similar to those found in invasive aspergillosis, which has an incidence of 2.7% in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant.4 Invasive aspergillosis is an infection caused by the fungal Aspergillus species, which is ubiquitous in the environment.6 As transmission is primarily through inhalation, invasive aspergillus most commonly presents with pulmonary or sinus disease that can then progress to dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. Both Aspergillus and Fusarium may cause elevated serum galactomannan antigen. Chest CT findings of invasive aspergillosis and disseminated fusariosis are similar, and both may show ground-glass opacities, segmental consolidation, cavitary lesions, and the “halo sign” (ground-glass opacities representing hemorrhage surrounding central fungal nodules). Lactophenol cotton blue staining of mold colony can differentiate between the 2 pathogens, as Aspergillus species have septate hyphae and flask-shaped vesicles.1,7Ecthyma gangrenosum is a cutaneous infection caused by hematogenous spread of bacteria, most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It most frequently occurs in immunocompromised individuals, including those with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.8 As this represents bacterial angioinvasion, ecthyma gangrenosum presents as purpuric macules that may become pustular or bullous before progressing to ulcers with overlying eschar most commonly in the anogenital and axillary areas. In most cases, Pseudomonas can be detected from tissue specimens, but blood culture results are often negative.9Sweet syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a rare disorder that is commonly associated with hematologic cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia. Sweet syndrome can also be associated with other states, such as autoimmune disease, or be due to medications, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Classic Sweet syndrome presents as tender, erythematous, and edematous plaques associated with fever and leukocytosis. Cutaneous involvement generally does not show overlying eschar, as seen in disseminated fusariosis. Skin biopsy histopathologic features can mimic infection with dermal edema and a dense infiltrate of neutrophils; however, the results of infectious stains and tissue culture will be negative. Systemic corticosteroids are often first-line treatments for Sweet syndrome.10The patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin B and voriconazole for disseminated fusariosis, with resolution of her cutaneous lesions over the course of 6 weeks.

Therefore, diagnosis of PG depends largely on clinical history, histological findings, and exclusion of other inflammatory or ulcerative cutaneous diseases.1,2 While early-stage PG shows intradermal neutrophils and perifollicular inflammation, ulcerative PG at later stages typically demonstrates epidermal or dermal necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and abscess formation.1 Deposition of IgM, C3, and fibrin can be observed in PG, but these findings are nonspecific.4 There are 4 morphologic subtypes of PG. Ulcerative PG is characterized by rapid progression of inflammatory papules, pustules, or vesicles to ulcerative lesions. Bullous PG is characterized by rapid development of inflammatory bullae. Pustular PG commonly occurs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease during an acute exacerbation. Vegetative PG is characterized by localized and superficial lesions with an indolent disease course.1The pathogenesis of PG depends primarily on immune dysregulation and genetic factors. Previous studies have shown that gene expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor α and interleukins [ILs] IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, IL-23, and IL-36) and levels of pattern recognition receptors are increased in the cutaneous lesions of PG, leading to activation of inflammasomes and dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunities.1 Furthermore, several reports from familial cases of PG suggest that genetic factors can play important roles in PG pathogenesis,5 and variants in PTSTPIP1/CD2BP1, MEFV, NLRP3, NLRP12, NOD2, and LPIN2 have been reported in PG.1Among hematological cancers associated with PG, 10% to 20% of patients with MDS develop autoimmune manifestations that include NDs, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet disease, and vasculitis.6 Chromosomal abnormalities commonly identified in patients with MDS and their autoimmune manifestations include del5q (22.6% of participants in one study),7 in which haploinsufficiency of RPS14 from del5q upregulates S100A9, a DAMP (damage-associated molecular pattern) protein, that plays essential roles in chronic inflammation and innate immunity.8 Notably, ND was associated with significantly adverse survival outcomes in patients with MDS in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.03-3.09; P = .04),7 although other studies found that overall prognosis was more closely related to the IPSS (International Prognostic Scoring System) category than to the underlying autoimmune process.9 In addition, PG has been reported to be associated with lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug that is commonly used to treat MDS, multiple myeloma, and lymphomas,10 although the exact frequency of PG associated with lenalidomide remains to be determined.Treatment of PG varies depending on severity and extent of involved cutaneous lesions. First-line treatment for limited disease includes topical corticosteroid or tacrolimus.1 For patients with extensive or rapidly progressing disease, a systemic steroid (0.5-1.5 mg/kg/d of prednisone or its equivalent, then taper over 4-6 weeks) or cyclosporin (in patients who cannot tolerate systemic steroids) is recommended as the first-line treatment, and adjunctive agents (eg, infliximab, azathioprine, mycophenolate) can be added to prevent disease flare during steroid taper.1 In cases of refractory disease, intravenous immunoglobulin or alkylating agents (eg, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil) could be an option, although many other agents (eg, melphalan, thalidomide, canakinumab, tocilizumab) have been reported to be effective.1In this patient, lenalidomide was discontinued and he was treated with methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg/d, and infliximab, 5 mg/kg.

Ulcerative PG is characterized by rapid progression of inflammatory papules, pustules, or vesicles to ulcerative lesions. Bullous PG is characterized by rapid development of inflammatory bullae. Pustular PG commonly occurs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease during an acute exacerbation. Vegetative PG is characterized by localized and superficial lesions with an indolent disease course.1The pathogenesis of PG depends primarily on immune dysregulation and genetic factors. Previous studies have shown that gene expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor α and interleukins [ILs] IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, IL-23, and IL-36) and levels of pattern recognition receptors are increased in the cutaneous lesions of PG, leading to activation of inflammasomes and dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunities.1 Furthermore, several reports from familial cases of PG suggest that genetic factors can play important roles in PG pathogenesis,5 and variants in PTSTPIP1/CD2BP1, MEFV, NLRP3, NLRP12, NOD2, and LPIN2 have been reported in PG.1Among hematological cancers associated with PG, 10% to 20% of patients with MDS develop autoimmune manifestations that include NDs, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet disease, and vasculitis.6 Chromosomal abnormalities commonly identified in patients with MDS and their autoimmune manifestations include del5q (22.6% of participants in one study),7 in which haploinsufficiency of RPS14 from del5q upregulates S100A9, a DAMP (damage-associated molecular pattern) protein, that plays essential roles in chronic inflammation and innate immunity.8 Notably, ND was associated with significantly adverse survival outcomes in patients with MDS in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.03-3.09; P = .04),7 although other studies found that overall prognosis was more closely related to the IPSS (International Prognostic Scoring System) category than to the underlying autoimmune process.9 In addition, PG has been reported to be associated with lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug that is commonly used to treat MDS, multiple myeloma, and lymphomas,10 although the exact frequency of PG associated with lenalidomide remains to be determined.Treatment of PG varies depending on severity and extent of involved cutaneous lesions. First-line treatment for limited disease includes topical corticosteroid or tacrolimus.1 For patients with extensive or rapidly progressing disease, a systemic steroid (0.5-1.5 mg/kg/d of prednisone or its equivalent, then taper over 4-6 weeks) or cyclosporin (in patients who cannot tolerate systemic steroids) is recommended as the first-line treatment, and adjunctive agents (eg, infliximab, azathioprine, mycophenolate) can be added to prevent disease flare during steroid taper.1 In cases of refractory disease, intravenous immunoglobulin or alkylating agents (eg, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil) could be an option, although many other agents (eg, melphalan, thalidomide, canakinumab, tocilizumab) have been reported to be effective.1In this patient, lenalidomide was discontinued and he was treated with methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg/d, and infliximab, 5 mg/kg. Skin lesions improved considerably and there has been no recurrence.",51_G_a_n_m,"1  
Gender has minimal impact in this case, as the clinical presentation and diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum are not significantly influenced by the patient's gender. While certain conditions may have gender-specific prevalence, the primary factors driving the clinical situation here are the patient's underlying myelodysplastic syndrome and the characteristics of the skin lesions.","C  
The clinical presentation and histopathological findings suggest a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. The patient has multiple nonhealing skin ulcers with a rapid progression and a dense dermal infiltrate of neutrophils, which is characteristic of this condition. The absence of immature myeloid precursors and the presence of myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of myelodysplastic syndrome and the development of ulcers after treatment with lenalidomide align with known associations of pyoderma gangrenosum. Other options, such as leukemia cutis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis, do not fit the clinical and histological picture as well as pyoderma gangrenosum does.",,,,,,

Hence, they share structural and functional homology with sweat glands.5In addition to staining positive for GATA-3, adnexal tumors stain positive for P63, CK5/6, and CK-7. The clinical picture of the current patient was challenging due to the lack of a discrete breast mass and a positron emission tomography scan demonstrating an FDG-avid infiltrating mass in the chest wall and several lymph nodes in the axillary and internal mammary chain. A core-needle biopsy of the chest wall mass showed a similar staining pattern but stained positive for ER, unlike the punch biopsy of the skin, which was negative for both ER and progesterone receptor. However, a positive ER status alone is not sufficient to differentiate between an adnexal gland tumor and breast cancer.6 The diagnosis was finally established with the results of the positive molecular testing for CDKN2, ERBB2, and PIK3CA. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases-CA (PIK3CA) variation is highly associated with ER-positive/ERBB2-negative breast cancer.7 Likewise, ERBB2 (also known as HER2 or neu) is expressed in 30% of breast cancers.8 Limited studies in patients with adnexal gland tumors reported no expression of PIK3CA or ERBB2 in such patients.9 Hence, the current patient’s pattern of the molecular profile of tumor tissue was most consistent with carcinoma of breast origin.Breast cancer in men accounts for 1% of all breast cancers.10 Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive form of breast cancer that accounts for 2% to 4% of all breast cancers and 7% to 10% of breast cancer mortality in the US. The majority of men with breast cancer present with retroareolar mass. The usual presenting features are skin ulceration, retraction, bleeding from the nipple, or axillary lymphadenopathy.

115,"This case highlights an increasingly common circumstance encountered in the management of patients with advanced liver cancer as well as other solid tumors—diagnostic considerations for an acute medical issue in a patient with a long-term response to ongoing immunotherapy.1,2 Here, the patient had been receiving treatment for 18 months without evidence of active liver cancer and presented with epigastric pain, a common clinical complaint with a broad differential diagnosis.3 The evaluation must consider the presence of chronic liver disease and metastatic HCC, as well as the potential complications of immunotherapy.As the median progression-free survival with metastatic HCC being treated with frontline immunotherapy is only 3.7 to 6.8 months, worsening abdominal pain warrants immediate assessment for progressive cancer.1,2 Normal AFP level and atypical imaging findings of gastric body thickening are inconsistent with HCC disease recurrence. Secondary malignant neoplasm (eg, gastric cancer) occurs in about 3% of patients with HCC and is a consideration given radiographic findings, though the biopsy specimen showed no malignant neoplasm.4Portal hypertensive gastropathy occurs due to cirrhosis or in the noncirrhotic liver affected with extensive cancer or portal vein tumor thrombus.5 Portal vein involvement by HCC occurs in up to 40% of patients with advanced disease and may lead to abnormal EGD findings.1 Portal hypertensive gastropathy rarely manifests as epigastric discomfort and has a characteristic fine reticular appearance of the gastric mucosa (snakeskin appearance) on EGD with pathologic findings of capillary ectasia and dilated mucosal and submucosal veins.5Here, pathology review showed lymphocytic gastritis, which can be associated with celiac disease, Crohn disease, infection, and drug effect. Although infectious gastritis (ie, H pylori and cytomegalovirus) is plausible, no pathogens were detected on special stains, and the radiographic findings were atypical for this entity.The diagnostic workup was most consistent with immunotherapy-related gastritis as a late complication of long-term anti–programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) therapy. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are now well documented and are an on-target toxic effect of PD-1/PD-L1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) pathway interference—reactivating T-cell–mediated antitumor activity with a cost of breaking immunological self-tolerance. Immune-related adverse events may affect multiple organs with varying severity and time to onset. In a meta-analysis of 7936 patients with advanced solid tumors, gastrointestinal toxic effects were the second most common irAEs observed in 10.7% (95% CI, 8.9%-13.0%) of patients treated with nivolumab, and in 33.6% (95% CI, 27.2%-40.6%) of patients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab.6 Only about 1% of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy have been reported to have immune-mediated gastritis, which presents with epigastric pain, anorexia, and emesis, with varied time to onset from weeks to up to 3 years.7-9 As in this case, EGD often shows fragile antral mucosa with erosions or ulcerations.8,9 Biopsy is characterized by severe inflammatory cell infiltration in the epithelium and lamina propria.Treatment of immune-mediated gastritis includes proton pump inhibitors and glucocorticoids, with options for refractory cases including use of infliximab, vedolizumab, or mycophenolate mofetil.7,9 As with other irAEs, retreatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy may be possible; however, up to 26% may experience recurrence of the same irAE, while another 26% may develop a new irAE.10 As the treatment of lymphocytic gastritis varies considerably based on cause, it is critical for pathologic review and special stains to rule out alternative causes.The patient’s symptoms improved with cessation of anti–PD-1 therapy, a course of corticosteroids, sucralfate, and indefinite proton pump inhibitor therapy. Twenty months later, she developed a new solitary lung metastasis. She received 5 additional doses of nivolumab without recurrence of gastritis and underwent successful oligo-metastasectomy. At last follow-up it was 7 years since her initial HCC diagnosis, and she was alive without evidence of disease.",115_G_o_o_f,"3  
Gender is moderately relevant in this case, as the patient is a 66-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma, conditions that can have different prevalence and outcomes based on gender. Additionally, the management of her cancer and the potential side effects of immunotherapy may be influenced by gender-specific factors, such as hormonal differences and the overall response to treatment.","D  
The clinical presentation and findings suggest immunotherapy-related gastritis.

Although the ring enhancement with intense surrounding edema resembled radiation necrosis, the affected region only received a conventional palliative radiotherapy dose, too low to cause radiation necrosis.

The risk of delaying irradiation if this were a metastasis vs the risk of irradiation causing further compromise if this were radiation recall myelopathy was discussed with the patient, and the decision was made to continue steroids with close clinical and radiographic surveillance.Radiation recall is a rare and poorly understood phenomenon that was initially described in 1959.1 Generally occurring months to years after radiation therapy, radiation recall refers to an inflammatory reaction in a previously irradiated region following systemic therapy administration.2 The incidence is challenging to estimate given that most data comes from case reports, with estimates ranging from 2% to 9%.1,3,4 Although radiation recall reactions of the skin are the most common manifestation, additional studies have described inflammatory reactions in other tissues, including the lung (pneumonitis following gemcitabine), muscles (myositis after cyclophosphamide), and spine (myelitis following capecitabine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, dabrafenib, or pembrolizumab).5-7 Although doxorubicin has previously been implicated in radiation recall,4 to our knowledge, this is the first report specifically describing doxorubicin-associated recall myelopathy. Of note, liposomal doxorubicin has superior central nervous system penetrance than standard doxorubicin, which may increase the risk of recall myelopathy.Prior reports of radiation recall–associated myelopathy have revealed certain associated radiographic findings. It is common to see a primary ring-enhancing lesion in the prior radiation field, as well as T1-weighted hyperintense marrow signal changes in adjacent vertebrae.8 Spinal cord swelling and T2-signal abnormalities, predominantly involving the central cord, demonstrating longitudinal cord edema extending outside the radiation field has also been observed.8,9 The etiology of this edema is unknown but could be owing to an extensive nonimmune inflammatory reaction.7There is no standard treatment paradigm for radiation recall. At a minimum, the precipitating systemic agent should be held. Although there has also been success attributed to steroids, bevacizumab, immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, or hyperbaric oxygen,2,9,10 it is unclear whether these agents are truly efficacious or whether clinical improvement or stabilization naturally ensues over time. Given its rarity, the prognosis remains unclear.Over the next month, the patient experienced mild clinical improvement in lower extremity weakness and pain but persistent urinary retention with high-dose steroid treatment. Findings on MRI 7 weeks after her initial scan demonstrated a decrease in the enhancing lesion and spinal cord edema (Figure 2). The lack of progression in the spine despite no oncologic therapy supported a diagnosis of radiation recall. She was discharged with instructions to taper steroid treatment with plans to initiate temozolomide.Magnetic resonance image of the spine 7 weeks after initial presentation.

The patient's gender is very relevant in this case, as leiomyosarcoma of the uterus primarily affects women, and the treatment options and outcomes can differ based on gender-specific factors. Additionally, the patient's age and gender may influence the approach to palliative care and the management of complications related to the disease and its treatment.","B  
The clinical presentation, including the atypical appearance of the intramedullary lesion and the extensive spinal cord edema, suggests radiation necrosis rather than a new malignant process. The lack of mass effect and the stable symptoms with steroid treatment further support this diagnosis. Bevacizumab has been used in cases of radiation necrosis to help manage symptoms and promote healing. Given the patient's history of radiation therapy and the MRI findings, continuing steroids while adding bevacizumab is the most appropriate course of action. Therefore, option B is the best choice.",,,,,,

Common adverse effects affecting more than 30% of patients receiving oral therapy include alopecia, dysgeusia, diarrhea, and fatigue.4 Overall, the most common adverse effect of pemigatinib is hyperphosphatemia, which develops in approximately 60% of patients.2Calciphylaxis is a rare skin disorder characterized by calcification within the lumen of the blood vessels in the adipose tissue and dermis occurring from dysregulation of calcium and/or phosphate metabolism. The intravascular calcium deposition can lead to ischemia with resultant painful necrosis of the overlying skin.5 Patients typically present with noninflammatory retiform purpura with necrosis, and the clinical differential diagnosis for this presentation includes other causes of noninflammatory retiform purpura, such as oxalate vasculopathy, cholesterol emboli, and type I cryoglobulinemia. Because of the clinical similarities between these entities, histopathologic examination is required to differentiate between the various causes of retiform purpura.Established risk factors for calciphylaxis include chronic kidney disease, obesity, hyperparathyroidism, female sex, diabetes mellitus, warfarin use, and protein C or S deficiency. However, a case of calciphylaxis in a patient receiving erdafitinib treatment, an FGFRi, for stage IV adenosarcoma was recently reported in the literature.6 The association with calciphylaxis is in the setting of a known adverse effect of hyperphosphatemia, which occurs in approximately 70% to 80% of patients taking the medication.7 Fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors interfere with normal FGF23/FGFR signaling in the kidneys and impairs kidney excretion of phosphate. The result is an abnormal calcium-phosphate product leading to calcium deposition in the tissues.8Most data to support treatment for calciphylaxis are extrapolated from case studies, retrospective studies, and observational studies. General principles of management include discontinuation of the FGFRi, prompt dermatology consult, wound care (if necrosis is present), and pain management. Treatment aimed at addressing the hyperphosphatemia includes counseling patients on avoiding foods high in phosphorus and may require a non–calcium-containing phosphate binder. It is equally important to manage calcium levels, and patients should be advised to stop any vitamin D or calcium supplementations. Treatment of calciphylaxis with intravenous sodium thiosulfate 3 times a week for approximately 3 to 4 weeks or until appropriate symptom relief has shown efficacy in improvement.9 The use of bisphosphonates can also be considered.Treatment for this patient included discontinuation of pemigatinib treatment followed by a bisphosphonate and sodium thiosulfate (3 times weekly) along with pain management and wound care. The patient is still receiving supportive care with minimal improvement after 4 weeks.

251,"The kidney is an uncommon site of clinically apparent melanoma metastases. While kidney micrometastases may be found in up to half of patients with a history of melanoma on postmortem evaluation, they are typically subclinical small cortical nodules.2,3 The few cases of symptomatic kidney involvement from melanoma have been secondary to large cortical masses that can be visualized on imaging.4-7 Thus, symptomatic kidney micrometastases and/or isolated tumor cells with intracapillary involvement are a rare phenomenon.The patient’s biopsy findings were suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) that followed metastatic melanoma cells occluding kidney capillaries and limiting blood flow to tubules. The specimen stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed intracapillary atypical cells with enlarged nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (Figure, A) and diffuse mild acute tubular injury with tubular dilatation and extensive isometric cytoplasmic vacuolization of tubular epithelial cells (Figure, B), which were consistent with ATN. Intracapillary atypical cells were positive for melanin-A (Figure, C), Sry-related HMg-Box gene 10, S-100, and human melanoma black–45 stains, which indicated the presence of melanoma micrometasases. These findings may account for the abnormal intraparenchymal flow that was visualized on ultrasonography, although no positron emission tomography avidity was appreciated in the kidneys.In the setting of the patient’s clinical history, the histopathologic findings were diagnostic for ATN secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis, primarily involving the glomeruli. The typical course of ATN involves a 1- to 2-week oliguric phase, followed by a 1- to 2-week nonoliguric phase and subsequent recovery of kidney function.8 The patient’s prolonged nonoliguric phase, with remarkable improvement corresponding to treatment with encorafenib, may further suggest that the etiology of his kidney injury was associated with melanoma. After starting treatment with encorafenib and being discharged from the hospital, the patient showed substantial improvement in his kidney function and overall status, no longer requiring hemodialysis.Other etiologies of ATN include kidney ischemia and nephrotoxin exposures.8 The patient had no risk factors for kidney ischemia and had been adequately hydrated with intravenous fluids. Although contrast can induce ATN, the peak in sCr levels typically occurs acutely after exposure (within 48-72 hours).9 However, this patient was in the hospital for several weeks, with no improvement in sCr levels until after encorafenib was administered. The patient’s other nephrotoxic exposures included proton-pump inhibitors, which are associated with allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) rather than ATN.10While AIN secondary to ICI therapy was also in the differential, there was no patchy edema or inflammatory cell infiltrate on pathology to support this diagnosis. Although histopathologic findings may have been affected by the course of steroids, the patient’s concomitant rapidly worsening kidney function made a diagnosis of AIN unlikely. Finally, albeit the exhaustive sampling of the biopsy cores was per protocol, there was no histopathologic evidence of microthrombi or postinfectious glomerulonephritis.This case illustrates a rare finding of metastatic melanoma with glomerular involvement followed by anuric kidney failure from ATN, with substantial recovery of kidney function with encorafenib. In conclusion, kidney metastases should be considered in patients with advanced melanoma who present with kidney failure, even if there is no visible mass on imaging. Kidney biopsy and/or treatment targeted at melanoma cells may be appropriate steps in management.",251_G_o_o_m,"1  
Gender has minimal impact in this case, as the clinical presentation and treatment decisions primarily revolve around the patient's stage IV melanoma and associated complications rather than gender-specific factors.

The clinical case presents a patient with stage IV melanoma who developed acute kidney injury characterized by rising serum creatinine levels and urinalysis findings consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The kidney biopsy, which is not detailed but implied to show atypical cells, suggests that the kidney injury is related to the underlying malignancy rather than a direct drug effect or an immune-mediated process. The timeline of events, including the patient's rapid deterioration and subsequent improvement after starting encorafenib, supports the diagnosis of ATN secondary to melanoma metastasis. Additionally, the presence of casts in the urine further indicates tubular injury rather than interstitial nephritis or glomerulonephritis. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis.",,,,,,

The specimen stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed intracapillary atypical cells with enlarged nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (Figure, A) and diffuse mild acute tubular injury with tubular dilatation and extensive isometric cytoplasmic vacuolization of tubular epithelial cells (Figure, B), which were consistent with ATN. Intracapillary atypical cells were positive for melanin-A (Figure, C), Sry-related HMg-Box gene 10, S-100, and human melanoma black–45 stains, which indicated the presence of melanoma micrometasases. These findings may account for the abnormal intraparenchymal flow that was visualized on ultrasonography, although no positron emission tomography avidity was appreciated in the kidneys.In the setting of the patient’s clinical history, the histopathologic findings were diagnostic for ATN secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis, primarily involving the glomeruli. The typical course of ATN involves a 1- to 2-week oliguric phase, followed by a 1- to 2-week nonoliguric phase and subsequent recovery of kidney function.8 The patient’s prolonged nonoliguric phase, with remarkable improvement corresponding to treatment with encorafenib, may further suggest that the etiology of his kidney injury was associated with melanoma. After starting treatment with encorafenib and being discharged from the hospital, the patient showed substantial improvement in his kidney function and overall status, no longer requiring hemodialysis.Other etiologies of ATN include kidney ischemia and nephrotoxin exposures.8 The patient had no risk factors for kidney ischemia and had been adequately hydrated with intravenous fluids. Although contrast can induce ATN, the peak in sCr levels typically occurs acutely after exposure (within 48-72 hours).9 However, this patient was in the hospital for several weeks, with no improvement in sCr levels until after encorafenib was administered. The patient’s other nephrotoxic exposures included proton-pump inhibitors, which are associated with allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) rather than ATN.10While AIN secondary to ICI therapy was also in the differential, there was no patchy edema or inflammatory cell infiltrate on pathology to support this diagnosis. Although histopathologic findings may have been affected by the course of steroids, the patient’s concomitant rapidly worsening kidney function made a diagnosis of AIN unlikely. Finally, albeit the exhaustive sampling of the biopsy cores was per protocol, there was no histopathologic evidence of microthrombi or postinfectious glomerulonephritis.This case illustrates a rare finding of metastatic melanoma with glomerular involvement followed by anuric kidney failure from ATN, with substantial recovery of kidney function with encorafenib.

The clinical case presents a 53-year-old woman with stage IV melanoma who developed acute kidney injury characterized by rising serum creatinine levels and the presence of casts, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The imaging findings and the patient's clinical history support the diagnosis of ATN due to the underlying malignancy.

There is a wide age distribution; however, myeloid sarcoma appears to be more common in the pediatric age group, with an incidence of up to 30% in children with AML vs 2% to 5% in adults.4,5Leukemia may manifest in the skin as a leukemid reaction or, less commonly, as cutaneous myeloid sarcoma. Leukemids represent nonspecific changes in the skin and most commonly result from bone marrow failure or humoral response to the primary tumor.1 In contrast, cutaneous myeloid sarcoma denotes the specific infiltration of neoplastic myeloid cells.1 It presents as multiple papules, plaques, or nodules with a characteristic reddish-brown or violaceous color. The most commonly involved region is the torso, although the head and neck regions and the extremities, as well as the mucosal region, can also be involved.5 Skin manifestation without evidence of systemic disease is referred to as aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma, but its presence is sufficient to establish a clinical diagnosis of AML. Previous studies have suggested that bone marrow involvement would become detectable in nearly all patients, with a mean interval of 10 months.5Recognition of this cutaneous phenomenon remains important for further classification and early diagnosis of myeloid leukemia. Nevertheless, diagnosis is often difficult owing to the presentation of isolated cutaneous findings outside the context of systemic disease.1 Histologically, cutaneous lesions show diffuse or nodular dermal infiltrates, with sparing of the upper papillary dermis. Involvement of the subcutis is common. Prominent single files of neoplastic cells between collagen bundles can be observed. The infiltrate is composed of immature myeloid cells. Markers usually expressed include CD45, CD68, and MPO. Lysozyme, CD34, CD13, CD14, CD15, and CD33 are positive in a variety of diseases.6 Few data on cytogenetic abnormalities in cutaneous myeloid sarcoma are available. The t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) and 11q23 abnormalities are the most commonly reported chromosomal abnormalities in myeloid sarcoma.7 Variations in NPM1 and FLT3 have been reported in 14% and 15% of patients with myeloid sarcoma, respectively.8,9Skin and bone marrow histologic findings are critical to confirm the diagnosis. Monomorphic skin lesions and the absence of peripheral nerve enlargement exclude lepromatous leprosy. Sarcoidosis can be considered but is less likely because of the fast growth of the skin nodules.

This infiltrate spilled into the surrounding interstitium. No leukemic or infective cells were seen, and the epidermis and upper dermis were relatively unremarkable. These findings are consistent with neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH).A rare condition with characteristic histopathological findings, NEH has variable clinical features.1,2 Most often, NEH presents in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy for hematological malignant neoplasms, particularly acute myeloid leukemia.2 Although cytarabine is considered to be the most common causative agent, other cytotoxic medications, including daunorubicin, decitabine, BRAF inhibitors, cetuximab, and imatinib, have been described as causing NEH.1,2 Non-antineoplastic agents described as causative include acetaminophen, adalimumab, azathioprine, and G-CSF, among others.1 Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis has been observed in other clinical settings, affecting patients with HIV, solid organ malignant neoplasms, and infections; among pediatric patients, it can occur without a precipitating event.1,3,4The cause of NEH remains speculative. Given the numerous clinical settings in which NEH presents, it is best considered a clinicopathological reaction pattern.1,3,4 When seen in the context of medication, it has been suggested that neutrophilic inflammation is caused by direct cytotoxicity of the drug secreted in sweat through the eccrine coils.2The clinical presentation of NEH generally includes erythematous nodules and plaques that are variably painful.1,2 The trunk and extremities are often affected, and lesions also can occur on the face, scalp, and acral surfaces.1,2,4 Associated features can include fever and pathergy.2The diagnosis of NEH relies on histopathologic evaluation and shows distinctive perieccrine neutrophils and leukocytoclasis with subsequent necrosis and vacuolar change along the basement membrane underlying the eccrine epithelium. Edema, mucin deposition, cellular atypia, and syringosquamous metaplasia occur as variable reactive changes.2After identifying and removing the trigger, management of NEH is mostly supportive; generally, recovery is spontaneous and without scarring.1,2 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral corticosteroids, and dapsone are therapeutic options described in the literature.1,2,5 Topical medications are thought to be ineffective given the depth of the inflammation.2 Chemotherapy can be continued if the associated symptoms are tolerable; if not, a change in the regimen may be advisable. Subsequent episodes of NEH can occur if the patient receives the same chemotherapy regimen.2In this patient, the lesions resolved in 1 week with only supportive management. Several weeks later, the patient required a new course of G-CSF (5 consecutive days), and the lesions did not recur. Therefore, cytarabine was the most likely trigger of NEH in this patient. The patient proceeded to bone marrow transplant and so, was not rechallenged with cytarabine. While we cannot exclude an infectious trigger, it was considered less likely because no infective organism was identified at the time of diagnosis.Sweet syndrome is a differential diagnosis of NEH. Both are classified under neutrophilic dermatoses and have overlapping features. Associations for both include hematological cancers and medication, specifically G-CSF. Sweets syndrome presents with fever and tender erythematous nodules and plaques.1 Histologically, however, Sweets syndrome shows a more dense, predominantly dermal, neutrophilic infiltrate with prominent dermal edema and no perieccrine accentuation.1Leukemia cutis can present with indurated nodules or plaques that may be erythematous. Usually associated with acute myeloid leukemia, it is a poor prognostic sign.6 Histopathological features consist of a deeper dermal and subcutaneous infiltrate with monotonous, atypical myeloblasts and myelocytes and variable immunohistochemical expression.7Finally, in urticaria, the erythematous wheals are pruritic and evanescent.

The clinical presentation of tender, erythematous plaques and nodules, particularly in the context of chemotherapy for acute leukemia, suggests neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. The rapid progression of lesions and the presence of a leukocytoclastic neutrophilic infiltrate in the biopsy support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's elevated neutrophil count and the timing of the lesions' appearance during chemotherapy align with neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis, which is often associated with myelosuppressive therapy.

The clinical presentation of tender, erythematous plaques and nodules, particularly in the context of chemotherapy for acute leukemia, suggests neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. The rapid progression of lesions and the presence of a leukocytoclastic neutrophilic infiltrate in the biopsy support this diagnosis.

270,"Results of the patient’s punch biopsy demonstrated a leukocytoclastic neutrophilic infiltrate in the deeper dermis, around the appendage structures and the coiled eccrine glands. This infiltrate spilled into the surrounding interstitium. No leukemic or infective cells were seen, and the epidermis and upper dermis were relatively unremarkable. These findings are consistent with neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH).A rare condition with characteristic histopathological findings, NEH has variable clinical features.1,2 Most often, NEH presents in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy for hematological malignant neoplasms, particularly acute myeloid leukemia.2 Although cytarabine is considered to be the most common causative agent, other cytotoxic medications, including daunorubicin, decitabine, BRAF inhibitors, cetuximab, and imatinib, have been described as causing NEH.1,2 Non-antineoplastic agents described as causative include acetaminophen, adalimumab, azathioprine, and G-CSF, among others.1 Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis has been observed in other clinical settings, affecting patients with HIV, solid organ malignant neoplasms, and infections; among pediatric patients, it can occur without a precipitating event.1,3,4The cause of NEH remains speculative. Given the numerous clinical settings in which NEH presents, it is best considered a clinicopathological reaction pattern.1,3,4 When seen in the context of medication, it has been suggested that neutrophilic inflammation is caused by direct cytotoxicity of the drug secreted in sweat through the eccrine coils.2The clinical presentation of NEH generally includes erythematous nodules and plaques that are variably painful.1,2 The trunk and extremities are often affected, and lesions also can occur on the face, scalp, and acral surfaces.1,2,4 Associated features can include fever and pathergy.2The diagnosis of NEH relies on histopathologic evaluation and shows distinctive perieccrine neutrophils and leukocytoclasis with subsequent necrosis and vacuolar change along the basement membrane underlying the eccrine epithelium. Edema, mucin deposition, cellular atypia, and syringosquamous metaplasia occur as variable reactive changes.2After identifying and removing the trigger, management of NEH is mostly supportive; generally, recovery is spontaneous and without scarring.1,2 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral corticosteroids, and dapsone are therapeutic options described in the literature.1,2,5 Topical medications are thought to be ineffective given the depth of the inflammation.2 Chemotherapy can be continued if the associated symptoms are tolerable; if not, a change in the regimen may be advisable. Subsequent episodes of NEH can occur if the patient receives the same chemotherapy regimen.2In this patient, the lesions resolved in 1 week with only supportive management. Several weeks later, the patient required a new course of G-CSF (5 consecutive days), and the lesions did not recur. Therefore, cytarabine was the most likely trigger of NEH in this patient. The patient proceeded to bone marrow transplant and so, was not rechallenged with cytarabine. While we cannot exclude an infectious trigger, it was considered less likely because no infective organism was identified at the time of diagnosis.Sweet syndrome is a differential diagnosis of NEH. Both are classified under neutrophilic dermatoses and have overlapping features. Associations for both include hematological cancers and medication, specifically G-CSF. Sweets syndrome presents with fever and tender erythematous nodules and plaques.1 Histologically, however, Sweets syndrome shows a more dense, predominantly dermal, neutrophilic infiltrate with prominent dermal edema and no perieccrine accentuation.1Leukemia cutis can present with indurated nodules or plaques that may be erythematous. Usually associated with acute myeloid leukemia, it is a poor prognostic sign.6 Histopathological features consist of a deeper dermal and subcutaneous infiltrate with monotonous, atypical myeloblasts and myelocytes and variable immunohistochemical expression.7Finally, in urticaria, the erythematous wheals are pruritic and evanescent. A diagnosis of urticaria is histologically supported by dermal edema, mild predominantly perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, and occasional eosinophils.7",270_G_a_n_m,"1  
In this case, the patient's gender has minimal impact on the clinical situation, as acute leukemia and its treatment, including the development of skin lesions, are not significantly influenced by gender. While certain cancers may have gender-specific prevalence, the primary focus here is on the disease process and treatment response, which are largely independent of gender.","B

EGFRIs interfere with normal growth and differentiation of epidermal cells and hair follicles and thus have high potential for skin toxic effects. Common cutaneous adverse effects of EGFRIs include xerosis, pruritus, acneiform papulopustular eruptions, nail changes (paronychia, pyogenic granuloma–like lesions, brittleness, onycholysis), hair changes (alopecia [scarring and nonscarring], eyelash trichomegaly), mucositis (oral, ocular, genital), and photosensitivity.4,5 Severe cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have rarely been reported. Importantly, development of an EGFRI-induced cutaneous eruption has been shown to be positively correlated with both progression-free and overall survival and may forecast the therapeutic response.4This patient was also being treated with a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BRAFi + MEKi), which itself has the potential for cutaneous adverse effects. These include morbilliform exanthems, papulopustular eruptions, pruritus, xerosis, alopecia, photosensitivity, palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia, panniculitis, and keratinocytic proliferations (actinic keratoses, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, keratoacanthomas). Compared with BRAFi monotherapy, the incidence of keratinocytic proliferations is reduced by combination BRAFi + MEKi therapy.6Our review of the literature revealed 5 cases of EGFRI therapy associated with EPDS-like eruptions, 4 (80%) of which occurred in East Asian women.5,7-10 Culprit medications included cetuximab, gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, suggesting a class effect. Disease onset ranged from 1 to 36 months after initiation of treatment. Treatment of Staphylococcus colonization in several cases had no impact on skin findings, whereas administration of topical and oral corticosteroids showed variable efficacy. Dose decreases or discontinuation of the EGFRIs led to improvement in 3 cases.This case draws awareness to the newly recognized entity of EGFRI-associated EPDS. With expanding use of EGFRIs, this treatment-emergent adverse cutaneous event is likely to be encountered more frequently.

301,"The pathological findings of the patient’s CT-guided biopsy were compatible with inflammation or SLR. The main feature of this patient was the mild presenting symptom but with the rapid development of consolidated lung with interstitial pneumonia on his CT scan. The diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was rejected because the patient had a dry cough only, and findings of bronchial washings were negative. Disease recurrence was considered, but the decreasing carcinoembryonic antigen levels  seemed inconsistent. Although a similar CT finding can be found in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)–induced interstitial lung disease (ILD), the mild symptom was incompatible with this diagnosis. There was no direct evidence to support the change of treatment to chemotherapy or steroids. With this in mind, clinicians must consider rebiopsy, and the diagnosis of the SLR was compatible with clinical symptoms and CT findings.Cancer-associated SLR is characterized by epithelioid cell granulomas with T-cell infiltration in pathologic findings (Figure, B) and observed in patients with hematological malignancies or solid tumors. In contrast to sarcoidosis with systemic involvement, cancer-associated SLR is usually asymptomatic, and the incidence of SLR lymphadenopathy in lung cancer ranges from 1.3% to 11%.1 Sarcoid-like reaction with ground-glass pulmonary infiltrates or lung consolidation is rare. Although fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is useful for evaluating the recurrence of lung cancer, it has been reported to produce false-positive results in cases of SLR.2Sarcoid-like reactions  are elicited by antigenic factors released from the tumor cells and are mostly identified in the lymph nodes draining a malignant tumor. These antigenic factors may be either shed by the tumor cells or released during tumor necrosis. Therefore, such reactions can be identified at diagnosis or after chemotherapy and immunotherapy.3 In infiltrating tumors, the production of interferon gamma by local natural killer cells and T cells activates the dendritic cells, which then present the antigen to naive CD4+ T cells, converting them into T helper 1 cells and contributing to the maturation of macrophages and granuloma formation. In an observational cohort study of 127 patients with lung cancer undergoing curative resection, 19 (14.9%) had coexistent granulomatous inflammation in the resected specimen.1 Some treatments for cancer may produce necrotic material or metabolic substances and induce granulomatosis, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for bladder cancer and interleukin-2 treatment for kidney cell carcinoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed the therapeutic landscape for lung cancer, and several reports have described the development of SLRs after the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 inhibitors.4 Assessing the expression of programmed cell death (PD) 1 and PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients receiving nivolumab therapy, a recent study showed that an elevated expression of PD-L1 sequential to blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction can be associated with SLRs.5Although SLRs have been reported in patients receiving chemotherapy and immunotherapy, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a pulmonary consolidation pattern in a patient with ROS1 rearrangement receiving an anaplastic lymphoma kinase/ROS1 inhibitor. Sarcoid-like reactions often respond to corticosteroid treatment and do not require the discontinuation of treatment. Conversely, in TKI-induced ILDs, the destroyed endothelium of alveolar vessels or pneumocytes leads to the release of cytokines and the recruitment of more inflammatory cells that, in turn, induce more damage to the endothelial cells.6 Deaths associated with TKI-induced ILD have been reported, and permanent discontinuation of TKIs is required in severe cases.In this case, while the patient’s dry cough was not severe, he decided to halt his crizotinib use. He further refused steroid use and asked to resume the ceritinib treatment. His dry cough improved substantially, and the lung consolidation lesion subsequently decreased (Figure, B).

Conversely, in TKI-induced ILDs, the destroyed endothelium of alveolar vessels or pneumocytes leads to the release of cytokines and the recruitment of more inflammatory cells that, in turn, induce more damage to the endothelial cells.6 Deaths associated with TKI-induced ILD have been reported, and permanent discontinuation of TKIs is required in severe cases.In this case, while the patient’s dry cough was not severe, he decided to halt his crizotinib use. He further refused steroid use and asked to resume the ceritinib treatment. His dry cough improved substantially, and the lung consolidation lesion subsequently decreased (Figure, B). In conclusion, in cases involving a radiological pattern of disease progression, such as a new lung consolidation lesion associated with TKI use, our article suggests that a routine rebiopsy is needed to confirm the SLR and avoid misinterpretation.",301_G_a_n_m,"2  
Gender is somewhat relevant in this case as lung cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma, can exhibit different prevalence and outcomes based on gender, with women often having better survival rates than men. Additionally, gender may influence the patient's response to certain treatments and the likelihood of developing specific side effects, which could impact medical decisions.","C  
The patient's new consolidation lesion and dry cough, alongside the unremarkable results from mycobacterial and bacteriologic surveys, suggest the need for further investigation to confirm the diagnosis. A CT-guided biopsy would provide histological confirmation of whether the new lesion is due to disease recurrence or another process, such as granulomatous inflammation. Given the complexity of the case and the potential for misdiagnosis, obtaining tissue samples is crucial for appropriate management. The other options either assume a diagnosis without confirmation or suggest treatments that may not address the underlying issue. Therefore, performing a biopsy is the most prudent next step.",,,,,,

In a large review of 160 000 laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas, 2% were in the subglottis.1 Even rarer is the rate of metastatic lesions to the larynx from other primary sites, comprising 0.09% to 0.4% of laryngeal tumors.2 A literature review performed by Zenga et al3 in 2016 identified 41 cases of metastatic spread to the larynx from various primary tumor sites, the most common of which was colorectal adenocarcinoma (24%) followed by renal cell carcinoma (15%) and prostate carcinoma (15%).This patient’s biopsy specimen was identified as a colorectal adenocarcinoma metastasis based on the characteristic appearance of tubular glandular tissue within a stromal matrix on hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining for CDX2. A transcription factor within the nucleus, CDX2 is a marker for enteric (intestinal) differentiation and is identifiable via immunohistochemistry in greater than 90% of intestinal adenocarcinomas.4 Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 (Thermo Fisher) revealed a pathogenic NRAS (c.182A>G) and TP53 (c.673-1G>A) variation. Mismatch repair protein expression was intact, and the specimen was negative for ERBB2 amplification.The patient in this case had known metastases to the lungs at the time of assessment, so the likelihood that this lesion represented metastatic adenocarcinoma was higher than it otherwise would have been in a healthy patient. Given the lesion’s appearance as a mass endoscopically, granuloma and primary subglottic papilloma or carcinoma were included in the differential diagnosis. Confirmation of a new metastatic site to the subglottis would represent progressive disease and alter the patient’s eligibility to continue on a clinical trial. Thus, determination of the diagnosis with definitive biopsy was clinically indicated. Obtaining a biopsy of this lesion was challenging, given its subglottic location very near the inferior aspect of the true vocal folds. Given the anatomy involved, an office-based endoscopic biopsy under local anesthesia alone was deemed risky. Additionally, consideration of the risks to the patient in the setting of untreated malignant disease at this site, including local obstruction and invasion as well as complications from local radiotherapy, such as stenosis, perichondrosis, or even necrosis, led to the decision to proceed with definitive operative biopsy in a setting with a controlled airway.To address the concern for bleeding or avulsion of the lesion with endotracheal intubation, the airway was managed by the otolaryngology team. After induction of anesthesia and verification that the patient could be mask ventilated, a chemical paralytic agent was administered, and the entire glottis was exposed with a Lindholm laryngoscope. The procedure itself was performed under apnea with the endotracheal tube removed, and ventilation was achieved as needed by carefully passing a 5.0 endotracheal tube with the cuff beyond the lesion under direct visualization with Hopkins rod-lens endoscopy.This case illustrates the importance of a multimodality approach to the diagnosis of airway lesions when biopsy results can alter the recommended direction of therapy.

327,"The concomitance of pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis (PPP) is consistent with the diagnosis of PPP syndrome. Most cases of PPP syndrome have been diagnosed in the context of an underlying pancreatic disease that courses with hyperlipasemia.1 Acute and chronic pancreatitis account for more than 50% of cases, whereas neoplastic conditions account for approximately 40%, particularly pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (ACC), but also neuroendocrine or other tumors.1 Alternative etiologies, including pancreatic fistula and trauma have also been reported to lead to PPP syndrome.1In September 2015, the patient underwent gastroduodenopancreatectomy plus splenectomy, and the tumor pathology was consistent with ACC; this procedure resulted in disappearance of PPP syndrome–associated symptoms. One year later, a fever as well as left fist and elbow arthritis developed; an abdominal CT was performed that revealed hepatic metastases. Fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin plus irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX) was started in December 2016. Despite toxic effects–related dose reductions and the patient’s desire for chemotherapy interruptions, he remained asymptomatic until July 2019 when, after a 4-month chemotherapy break, his PPP-associated symptoms recrudesced and a dose-reduced FOLFIRINOX regimen was resumed. Despite this, the patient’s PPP-associated symptoms persisted, and the patient died at the end of December 2019.Initially described in 1883, panniculitis is observed in 2% to 3% of patients with pancreatic disorders, including acute or chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma.2 Importantly, ACC, one of the rarest of pancreatic neoplastic histologic types (1% of nonendocrine pancreatic cancers),3 is the one most often associated with PPP syndrome—approximately 70% of cancer-associated PPP syndrome cases are ACC.1 Although the associated pathophysiologic events that induce PPP syndrome are not entirely clear, the mechanistic backbone of PPP relies on pancreatic release of massive amounts of pancreatic enzymes into the circulation. Notably, lipase-induced tissue lipolysis is the most probable etiologic factor in PPP syndrome, although pancreatic release of amylase and trypsin may also be involved.4 It is postulated that tissue lipolysis and the consequent fat-necrosis–mediated inflammation result in panniculitis, arthritis, pancreatitis, and even intramedullary necrosis.4,5Most patients with PPP syndrome are male, and the median age at diagnosis is 60 years, although this syndrome can affect patients of any age.1 Diagnosis of PPP syndrome is often a challenge, not only because of the heterogeneity of pancreatic diseases that cause this syndrome, but also because patients frequently develop panniculitis or arthritis prior to the appearance of overt clinical pancreatic disease-related symptoms.1 Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed for the diagnosis of PPP syndrome. It is important to note that symptoms associated with ACC are often unrelated to the release of pancreatic enzymes into the circulation. Indeed, patients’ symptoms are usually linked to both local tumor growth and distant metastasis. Overall, PPP syndrome is only acknowledged in about 16% of patients.6The prognosis of patients with ACC is usually dismal. About 77% of patients with ACC will present metastatic disease, and this stage of disease is associated with a median overall survival of 14 to 17 months.6,7 In contrast, patients submitted to complete pancreatic tumor resection had a median overall survival of 36 months.7 As opposed to other pancreatic cancers, potentially treatable BRAF rearrangements and BRCA pathway mutations were recently identified in most patients with ACC.8 However, modulating these potential targets has still not been reported and gemcitabine, FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, and FOLFIRINOX chemotherapeutic regimens are the most frequently used for ACC treatments.9,10 This case demonstrates a progression-free survival of 31 months after the start of FOLFIRINOX therapy for metastatic disease, expands our knowledge, and suggests that FOLFIRINOX is a good therapeutic option for the control of PPP-syndrome–associated symptoms in this rare disease and warrants further multicenter analysis.",327_G_o_o_m,"2

Additionally, the findings of cortical bone destruction and intraosseous medullary necrosis further support a diagnosis related to malignancy.

Despite this, the patient’s PPP-associated symptoms persisted, and the patient died at the end of December 2019.Initially described in 1883, panniculitis is observed in 2% to 3% of patients with pancreatic disorders, including acute or chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma.2 Importantly, ACC, one of the rarest of pancreatic neoplastic histologic types (1% of nonendocrine pancreatic cancers),3 is the one most often associated with PPP syndrome—approximately 70% of cancer-associated PPP syndrome cases are ACC.1 Although the associated pathophysiologic events that induce PPP syndrome are not entirely clear, the mechanistic backbone of PPP relies on pancreatic release of massive amounts of pancreatic enzymes into the circulation. Notably, lipase-induced tissue lipolysis is the most probable etiologic factor in PPP syndrome, although pancreatic release of amylase and trypsin may also be involved.4 It is postulated that tissue lipolysis and the consequent fat-necrosis–mediated inflammation result in panniculitis, arthritis, pancreatitis, and even intramedullary necrosis.4,5Most patients with PPP syndrome are male, and the median age at diagnosis is 60 years, although this syndrome can affect patients of any age.1 Diagnosis of PPP syndrome is often a challenge, not only because of the heterogeneity of pancreatic diseases that cause this syndrome, but also because patients frequently develop panniculitis or arthritis prior to the appearance of overt clinical pancreatic disease-related symptoms.1 Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed for the diagnosis of PPP syndrome. It is important to note that symptoms associated with ACC are often unrelated to the release of pancreatic enzymes into the circulation. Indeed, patients’ symptoms are usually linked to both local tumor growth and distant metastasis. Overall, PPP syndrome is only acknowledged in about 16% of patients.6The prognosis of patients with ACC is usually dismal. About 77% of patients with ACC will present metastatic disease, and this stage of disease is associated with a median overall survival of 14 to 17 months.6,7 In contrast, patients submitted to complete pancreatic tumor resection had a median overall survival of 36 months.7 As opposed to other pancreatic cancers, potentially treatable BRAF rearrangements and BRCA pathway mutations were recently identified in most patients with ACC.8 However, modulating these potential targets has still not been reported and gemcitabine, FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, and FOLFIRINOX chemotherapeutic regimens are the most frequently used for ACC treatments.9,10 This case demonstrates a progression-free survival of 31 months after the start of FOLFIRINOX therapy for metastatic disease, expands our knowledge, and suggests that FOLFIRINOX is a good therapeutic option for the control of PPP-syndrome–associated symptoms in this rare disease and warrants further multicenter analysis.",327_G_a_f_m,"3

327,"The concomitance of pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis (PPP) is consistent with the diagnosis of PPP syndrome. Most cases of PPP syndrome have been diagnosed in the context of an underlying pancreatic disease that courses with hyperlipasemia.1 Acute and chronic pancreatitis account for more than 50% of cases, whereas neoplastic conditions account for approximately 40%, particularly pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (ACC), but also neuroendocrine or other tumors.1 Alternative etiologies, including pancreatic fistula and trauma have also been reported to lead to PPP syndrome.1In September 2015, the patient underwent gastroduodenopancreatectomy plus splenectomy, and the tumor pathology was consistent with ACC; this procedure resulted in disappearance of PPP syndrome–associated symptoms.

Mastocytomas in adults are unusual; extracutaneous presentations are exceedingly rare1,2 and should prompt thorough evaluation for SM.The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for SM3 require the presence of the major criterion (multifocal infiltrates of >15 mast cells in bone marrow or other extracutaneous tissue) and 1 minor criterion, or the presence of 3 minor criteria—atypical morphology of mast cells, KIT D816V variation, mast cells expressing CD25, or elevated serum total tryptase. Systemic mastocytosis is further divided into 5 subvariants ranging from indolent SM to mast cell leukemia. In this patient, the multidisciplinary team agreed that the presence of paraspinal masses encroaching on the spinal cord was sufficient to classify it as aggressive SM (World Health Organization diagnostic criteria requires SM and end-organ damage). Because many patients with SM also present with associated hematologic neoplasms, their prognosis is largely dictated by the associated hematologic neoplasm. A series of 342 patients with SM4 revealed that 12% presented with aggressive SM without an associated hematologic neoplasm. Median survival for these patients was 41 months, with 5% ultimately progressing to leukemia.Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) refers to episodic symptoms (anaphylacticlike) related to mast cell mediator release, largely histamine and prostaglandins.

Ultrasound-induced mast cell degranulation has been reported only in animals,5 and while the mechanism of action is unknown, acoustic agitation of mast cell plasma membranes has been hypothesized.6 Mast cell activation syndrome can be managed with avoidance of triggers and with antimediator therapy, such as H1/H2 blockers, corticosteroids, antileukotrienes, and intramuscular epinephrine for severe cases.Aggressive SM warrants treatment given the risk of organ compromise. Although enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged, systemic therapies with known activity against SM include cladribine,7 midostaurin,8 interferons,7 and imatinib9 (only for patients without KIT D816V variation). Furthermore, nonsurgical localized management of aggressive SM and mastocytomas has been seldom reported in humans and is typically reserved for palliation of local symptoms.1 Disease that is refractory to medical therapies should prompt evaluation for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.10Because of progression of paraspinal disease following treatment with cladribine, midostaurin, and imatinib, the patient in this case underwent palliative spinal radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant consisting of myeloablative total body irradiation (12 Gy in 8 fractions twice daily). Despite our concerns of MCAS in this patient following 2 separate courses of radiotherapy, we have observed that radiotherapy is a poor trigger for MCAS.Three years following allogeneic transplant, the patient was found to have elevated serum tryptase levels in the setting of severe anaphylaxis episodes and confirmation of recurrent SM by bone marrow biopsy.

A biopsy specimen obtained from the right axilla lymph nodes confirmed a diagnosis of NK/T-cell lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy was performed, and the results demonstrated no evidence of lymphoma. A diagnosis of intravascular NK/T-cell lymphoma with lymph node involvement was made. The patient received multiagent chemotherapy with the COEP-L regimen (cyclophosphamide, etoposide, vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase) and achieved complete remission after 6 cycles. She has remained free of disease for 1 year and is regularly monitored.Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma is a group of aggressive malignant neoplasms of putative NK-cell origin or NK-like cytotoxic T-cell origin.1 Intravascular NKTCL is a highly aggressive intravascular lymphoma with NK/T-cell origin. This entity has a higher incidence in East Asia and Central and South America2 and is frequently associated with EBV, suggesting that EBV may play a role in the pathogenesis of intravascular NKTCL. Although any organ can be involved, the skin and central nervous system are the most likely to be affected. Indurated plaques or nodules (typically on the lower extremities) are the most frequent skin lesions. B symptoms (fever, weight loss, and/or night sweats) are common in patients with intravascular NKTCL.3 The immunophenotypes of the neoplastic cells are positive for NK-cell or NK/T-cell antigens (CD3ε+, CD56+, and cytotoxic markers).4 Because multiple sites were involved in this patient, including the nasal cavity and lymph nodes, it was challenging to distinguish intravascular NKTCL from extranodal NKTCL, nasal type, although the restricted intravascular nature of the lymphoma cells and the chronological occurrence of skin lesions and nasal involvement favored the possibility of multiorgan spreading of intravascular NKTCL. The reason that the neoplastic cells are confined to the blood vessels in intravascular NKTCL remains unknown. Defects in the expression of homing receptors, such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 or integrin β1, have been associated with the intravascular growth pattern of lymphoma cells.5 The prognosis of intravascular NKTCL is poor. Most patients have only a partial and short-term response to conventional chemotherapy.6The main differential diagnosis of intravascular NKTCL is intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) because of its shared clinical and histological features. Intravascular LBCL is a subtype of extranodal LBCL and constitutes most intravascular lymphomas. The intravascular neoplastic cells express mature B-cell–associated antigens, and EBV is generally absent in intravascular LBCL.7Intravascular lymphomas should be differentiated from inflammatory and infectious skin diseases. Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis usually presents as painful nodules or purpura on the lower legs with systemic symptoms.8 Erysipelas is an infectious cellulitis, with a predilection for the lower legs.9 The characteristic histological features of intravascular NKTCL helped to rule out these other conditions in the present case.Intravascular NKTCL is a highly aggressive lymphoma with unique characteristics. Indurated violaceous plaques on the skin with B symptoms are the clues to the diagnosis. Recognizing the presenting symptoms and signs are pivotal to the early intervention of this rapidly progressive disease.",387_G_a_n_f,"1  
While the patient's gender may have some influence on the prevalence of certain conditions, in this specific case, the diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma is not significantly affected by gender. The clinical features and laboratory findings are more critical to the diagnosis and management than any gender-specific issues.","A  
The clinical presentation, including the painful erythematous plaques, significant edema, intermittent fever, and notably high levels of EBV DNA, strongly suggests a hematological malignancy. The skin biopsy findings of dilated vessels filled with atypical large lymphoid cells are characteristic of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma. The elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level further supports the diagnosis of a lymphoma, as it is often elevated in malignancies. The absence of response to antibiotics and the specific symptoms align with intravascular lymphoma rather than other options. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is intravascular large B-cell lymphoma.",,,,,,

418,"There are no clear differences in efficacy between licensed antipsychotic medications in head-to-head trials, although network meta-analyses1,2 suggest that clozapine, olanzapine, and amisulpride are among the most efficacious. Note: Amisulpride is approved for use in the United Kingdom where this patient was treated but is not approved for use in the United States. In addition to the short-term efficacy of antipsychotic medication, there is also evidence that maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs lowers the risk of relapse.3In addition to efficacy, the risk of adverse effects should be carefully considered when discussing treatment options (choice A). The patient in this clinical challenge is of African origin and had overweight, both of which increase the likelihood of adverse metabolic effects developing during antipsychotic treatment.4 Furthermore, psychosis itself is associated with an increased risk of metabolic dysfunction.5 Consequently, if efficacy and other risks of adverse effects are equal, treatments with a high risk of adverse metabolic effects, such as olanzapine (choice B), should be avoided if possible. Alternatives to amisulpride with relatively low levels of adverse metabolic effects include haloperidol and aripiprazole.Although clozapine (choice C) has demonstrated superiority compared with other antipsychotic medications, this has not been established for patients experiencing first episodes of psychosis, and it has a high burden of adverse effects and requires regular monitoring of full blood cell counts because of the risk of agranulocytosis. As a result, it is typically not recommended as a first-line treatment. It is, however, the only drug licensed for treatment resistance, and evidence indicates that early use in patients with treatment resistance leads to better outcomes.6Long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications are an underused treatment option and should be considered early in the illness course.7 However, even if a long-acting injectable drug is to be used from the first episode, it is generally preferable to first start with oral medication to allow an estimation of dosage and accommodate the time a drug takes to reach effective plasma levels.8The patient’s mental health team specialized in the management of first-episode psychosis, and dedicated early-intervention services are associated with considerable benefits for the individual patient and also their family.9 These teams provide social and psychological support in addition to pharmacological treatments. Cognitive behavioral therapy (choice D) does not have clear evidence of efficacy when given as a stand-alone treatment, but it shows benefit when given in combination with an antipsychotic drug.10Oral amisulpride in a dosage of 200 mg, twice daily, was prescribed initially (amisulpride is approved for use in the United Kingdom where the patient was treated). At a review 2 weeks later, although auditory hallucinations had reduced in intensity, the patient’s paranoid delusions persisted. She reported good medication concordance, and this was corroborated by the family. The dosage was therefore increased to 400 mg, twice daily, and cognitive behavioral therapy was also commenced. The patient complained of some stiffness, which improved when the morning dosage was reduced back to 200 mg, twice daily. The psychotic symptoms gradually resolved over the next 4 weeks, although she remained socially withdrawn. Her mother was supportive but became increasingly frustrated about her lack of activity and failure to get a new job, and she frequently criticized her for this.

The patient's symptoms, including auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and a family history of schizophrenia, suggest a possible psychotic disorder. Given that she has not responded to citalopram, an atypical antipsychotic like olanzapine is appropriate for managing her psychotic symptoms. Olanzapine is effective for treating both positive symptoms (like hallucinations and paranoia) and can help stabilize her mood. Starting with olanzapine allows for a more immediate intervention to address her distressing experiences.

454,"Malignant subungual tumors are rare and are associated with subungual squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Bowen disease, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and subungual keratoacanthoma among others. Of these malignant neoplasms, subungual SCC is the most frequent.1-4 Subungual SCC has been considered a low-grade malignant neoplasm with a good prognosis compared with SCC arising elsewhere.2-4 About 20% of patients with subungual SCC have bony invasion, and metastasis and lymph node involvement is uncommon.1-4 Usually, the patients tend to be men aged 50 to 79 years, and typically, a single digit, especially the thumb or hallux, is likely to be involved.1-3The origin of subungual SCC has not been well described. However, some causative factors have been proposed, including trauma, dyskeratosis congenita, sun exposure, radiation exposure, chemical exposure (ie, tar, arsenic, or exposure to minerals), immunosuppression, chronic infection, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially HPV 16 infection.1-3,5,6The indolent natural history and the variable clinical manifestations of subungual SCC often lead to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis and, subsequently, poor prognosis. Therefore, the differential diagnosis is very important and should include subungual keratoacanthoma, verruca vulgaris, exostosis, onychomycosis, and chronic paronychia. Subungual keratoacanthoma, is a benign tumor that usually presents as a painful, locally aggressive, and rapidly growing mass with a well-defined osteolytic destruction of the underlying bone.7,8 Although the histologic appearance and clinical presentation of subungual keratoacanthoma is sometimes indistinguishable from subungual SCC, the diagnosis in the present case was definitive given the patient’s 7-year medical history and the histologic results, which supported the diagnosis of subungual SCC. Verruca vulgaris, especially a subungual wart, can be confused with subungual SCC because of the similar appearance; however, the histopathologic findings revealed the appearance of subungual SCC, and HPV was not detected in the neoplastic squamous cells. Another important differential diagnosis is subungual exostosis, a benign osteocartilaginous tumor that appears as a wartlike nodule under the nail with onycholysis and nail plate destruction. However, subungual exostosis often occurs in children and young adults, with a radiograph revealing a calcifying projection on the distal phalanx, and the pathologic results showing mature trabecular bone.9 Chronic paronychia and onychomycosis also should be ruled out. However, chronic paronychia often affects the proximal and lateral nail folds, presenting as a red, tender, and swelling lesion with the absence of cuticle and onychodystrophy, which is not consistent with the clinical appearance in the present case. Furthermore, complete blood cell count results and mycological and bacteriologic examinations were unremarkable in the present case. Distal subungual onychomycosis, defined as a fungal infection, usually manifests as dystrophic, thick nails with onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and discoloration; although there are some similarities in the clinical appearances of onychomycosis and SCC, the unremarkable mycological examination was the most convincing evidence to exclude onychomycosis.A tissue biopsy should be performed for a definitive diagnosis and requires a high degree of suspicion. In the present case, hematoxylin-eosin staining of the initial biopsy specimen showed proliferation of atypical squamous cells invading the dermis on low power (magnification ×60) (Figure, B). Higher-power images (magnification ×100) showed large atypical neoplastic squamous cells with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic, and atypical mitosis (Figure, C). These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of subungual SCC. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the specimen was negative for HPV 16/18.Once subungual SCC is diagnosed, a lesion without bony involvement can be microscopically excised using Mohs micrographic surgery; otherwise, an amputation of the distal phalanx is recommended.1-3 The patient was referred for imaging and analytical studies to rule out bony involvement, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

Verruca vulgaris, especially a subungual wart, can be confused with subungual SCC because of the similar appearance; however, the histopathologic findings revealed the appearance of subungual SCC, and HPV was not detected in the neoplastic squamous cells. Another important differential diagnosis is subungual exostosis, a benign osteocartilaginous tumor that appears as a wartlike nodule under the nail with onycholysis and nail plate destruction. However, subungual exostosis often occurs in children and young adults, with a radiograph revealing a calcifying projection on the distal phalanx, and the pathologic results showing mature trabecular bone.9 Chronic paronychia and onychomycosis also should be ruled out. However, chronic paronychia often affects the proximal and lateral nail folds, presenting as a red, tender, and swelling lesion with the absence of cuticle and onychodystrophy, which is not consistent with the clinical appearance in the present case. Furthermore, complete blood cell count results and mycological and bacteriologic examinations were unremarkable in the present case. Distal subungual onychomycosis, defined as a fungal infection, usually manifests as dystrophic, thick nails with onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and discoloration; although there are some similarities in the clinical appearances of onychomycosis and SCC, the unremarkable mycological examination was the most convincing evidence to exclude onychomycosis.A tissue biopsy should be performed for a definitive diagnosis and requires a high degree of suspicion. In the present case, hematoxylin-eosin staining of the initial biopsy specimen showed proliferation of atypical squamous cells invading the dermis on low power (magnification ×60) (Figure, B). Higher-power images (magnification ×100) showed large atypical neoplastic squamous cells with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic, and atypical mitosis (Figure, C). These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of subungual SCC. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the specimen was negative for HPV 16/18.Once subungual SCC is diagnosed, a lesion without bony involvement can be microscopically excised using Mohs micrographic surgery; otherwise, an amputation of the distal phalanx is recommended.1-3 The patient was referred for imaging and analytical studies to rule out bony involvement, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

454,"Malignant subungual tumors are rare and are associated with subungual squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Bowen disease, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and subungual keratoacanthoma among others. Of these malignant neoplasms, subungual SCC is the most frequent.1-4 Subungual SCC has been considered a low-grade malignant neoplasm with a good prognosis compared with SCC arising elsewhere.2-4 About 20% of patients with subungual SCC have bony invasion, and metastasis and lymph node involvement is uncommon.1-4 Usually, the patients tend to be men aged 50 to 79 years, and typically, a single digit, especially the thumb or hallux, is likely to be involved.1-3The origin of subungual SCC has not been well described. However, some causative factors have been proposed, including trauma, dyskeratosis congenita, sun exposure, radiation exposure, chemical exposure (ie, tar, arsenic, or exposure to minerals), immunosuppression, chronic infection, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially HPV 16 infection.1-3,5,6The indolent natural history and the variable clinical manifestations of subungual SCC often lead to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis and, subsequently, poor prognosis.

In a cohort of 9 patients who developed arthritis during nivolumab therapy, 5 patients progressed to polyarticular arthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis, without any evidence of autoantibodies or notable bone erosions. These patients required a much higher dose of systemic steroids than those without polyarticular arthritis, and the arthritis persisted for several months after stopping nivolumab.3 In another case series, the authors described patients who developed seropositive rheumatoid arthritis shortly after receiving nivolumab, raising the concern that nivolumab may unmask underlying autoimmunity.4 In 1 report, a patient developed deforming arthritis during nivolumab therapy; however, imaging did not reveal erosions or joint damage.5The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends a high index of suspicion for irAEs with any new symptoms after initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).6 Timely referral to a rheumatologist is recommended. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy may be continued with close monitoring for grade 1 toxic effects except in the setting of some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxic effects. However, ICIs should be withheld in patients with grade 2 or higher toxic effects, and systemic corticosteroid therapy should be added, with a slow taper as needed. In patients who are unable to taper prednisone, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs may be offered, with methotrexate, leflunomide, or a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor as potential options.6There may be some concern about whether steroids affect the efficacy of ICIs;7 however, in a large cohort study in which steroids were used to treat irAEs, steroid use did not appear to affect progression-free survival.8 Conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (eg, methotrexate) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors used for ICI-related irAEs also did not appear to affect the overall response rate or survival outcome.9,10 These studies are reassuring and suggest that early and appropriate management of arthritis may be possible without affecting the antitumor response of ICIs.Herein, we describe a patient with partially treated, seronegative inflammatory erosive arthritis that developed after the use of nivolumab.

Ocular MG presents with fluctuating ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and diplopia. Generalized MG can also affect extraocular muscles but is characterized by proximal muscle weakness that worsens with muscle use. Although all the conditions in the differential diagnosis have been reported as adverse effects of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, the combination of ophthalmoparesis, ptosis, acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-Abs), and abnormal jitter on single-fiber electromyography is characteristic of MG.1-3 Lambert-Eaton syndrome also presents with weakness, but it typically improves with muscle use and is caused by antibodies against presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Miller Fisher syndrome is caused by autoantibodies against GQ1b, a ganglioside found in nerves. Guillain-Barré syndrome typically presents with ascending weakness and diminished deep tendon reflexes.The overall incidence of neurological adverse effects after ICI therapy is 3.8% with anti–cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 treatment and 6.1% with anti–programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) treatment.4 Myasthenia gravis is a relatively common neuromuscular adverse effect of ICIs across chemotherapy regimens and tumor types. Other common neurological complications include demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies, vasculitic neuropathies, isolated cranial neuropathies, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, and hypophysitis.5 Although the pathophysiology of ICI-induced MG has not been elucidated, some general mechanisms have been proposed for the immune adverse effects of ICI: (1) increased autoantibody production to normal cells and receptors (eg, AChR), (2) activated T cells recognizing antigens similar to tumor antigen in normal tissue, (3) increased proinflammatory cytokine levels, and (4) ICI monoclonal antibodies binding normal cells (eg, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4), triggering complement-mediated injury.6 Alterations in the Treg/Th17 axis and B cells populations may also be involved in autoimmune condition development.5,7 Interestingly, both exacerbations of previously diagnosed MG and de novo cases have been reported.8 Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced MG can also present simultaneously with other conditions such as myositis and myocarditis, with the frequency of concurrent myositis reported to be as high as 39%.8A recent review reported that ICI-induced MG-specific mortality was 30.4%, making early recognition of ICI toxic effects critical.8 Clinical suspicion for MG should be high for patients on immunotherapy who develop diplopia or proximal muscle weakness. The average onset of myasthenic symptoms is 5.59 weeks after treatment initiation, with a range of 2 to 12 weeks.8 Although 80% of the overall MG patient population has tested positive for AChR-Abs, only one-half to two-thirds of patients with ICI-induced MG are AChR-Ab positive.3,8,9 To our knowledge, no cases of ICI-induced MG in patients with muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies have been reported.3,8 Finally, single-fiber electromyography is 98% sensitive for MG but is not pathognomonic.10After diagnosis of MG, checkpoint inhibitors should be discontinued and immunosuppressive therapy initiated. Treatment options include corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin.

Other common neurological complications include demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies, vasculitic neuropathies, isolated cranial neuropathies, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, and hypophysitis.5 Although the pathophysiology of ICI-induced MG has not been elucidated, some general mechanisms have been proposed for the immune adverse effects of ICI: (1) increased autoantibody production to normal cells and receptors (eg, AChR), (2) activated T cells recognizing antigens similar to tumor antigen in normal tissue, (3) increased proinflammatory cytokine levels, and (4) ICI monoclonal antibodies binding normal cells (eg, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4), triggering complement-mediated injury.6 Alterations in the Treg/Th17 axis and B cells populations may also be involved in autoimmune condition development.5,7 Interestingly, both exacerbations of previously diagnosed MG and de novo cases have been reported.8 Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced MG can also present simultaneously with other conditions such as myositis and myocarditis, with the frequency of concurrent myositis reported to be as high as 39%.8A recent review reported that ICI-induced MG-specific mortality was 30.4%, making early recognition of ICI toxic effects critical.8 Clinical suspicion for MG should be high for patients on immunotherapy who develop diplopia or proximal muscle weakness. The average onset of myasthenic symptoms is 5.59 weeks after treatment initiation, with a range of 2 to 12 weeks.8 Although 80% of the overall MG patient population has tested positive for AChR-Abs, only one-half to two-thirds of patients with ICI-induced MG are AChR-Ab positive.3,8,9 To our knowledge, no cases of ICI-induced MG in patients with muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies have been reported.3,8 Finally, single-fiber electromyography is 98% sensitive for MG but is not pathognomonic.10After diagnosis of MG, checkpoint inhibitors should be discontinued and immunosuppressive therapy initiated. Treatment options include corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin. Cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, pyridostigmine) are ineffective as monotherapy but can be used with immunosuppressants to lower immunosuppressant dose and reduce adverse effects. Although the incidence of thymoma in ICI-induced MG is low, a thymectomy should be considered if present.8The patient’s nivolumab and cabozantinib were withheld. He was initially administered a 20-mg dose of prednisone daily and received 2 g of intravenous immunoglobulin over 5 days. A trial of pyridostigmine was not beneficial and was discontinued. Within 5 days, the diplopia improved and the creatine kinase levels decreased to 565 U/L (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Dexamethasone was gradually increased to 40 mg daily, and symptoms resolved 9 weeks after presentation. The tumor did not respond to neoadjuvant therapy and remained locally advanced, so he was referred for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization of the hepatic tumor.",481_G_a_n_m,"2  
Gender is somewhat relevant in this case as myasthenia gravis has a higher prevalence in females, particularly in younger age groups, which may influence the clinical approach and considerations for treatment. Additionally, gender-specific factors could affect the patient's response to therapy and the overall management of their condition.","A  
The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome. The patient exhibits diplopia, ptosis, and proximal muscle myalgia, which are characteristic symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Elevated creatine kinase and aldolase levels indicate muscle involvement, consistent with myositis. The abnormal single-fiber electromyography findings further support the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, as they show a pathologic mean consecutive difference without blocking. The absence of a thymoma and the specific antibody findings also align with this diagnosis.",,,,,,

Staging with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed cutaneous and subcutaneous radiotracer uptake in the left scapular region (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax], 13.7); contralateral subcutaneous nodules; and multiple bulky, bilateral laterocervical and axillary lymph nodes (SUVmax, 15).Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine neoplasm of the skin with a rising incidence.1 Clinical presentation may vary broadly, and diagnosis can be challenging, even for experienced dermatologists.2 Usually, MCC presents as an erythematous-to-violaceous, easily bleeding, painless or mildly painful, firm nodule occurring on areas of sun-exposed skin in elderly white men. In up to 10% of individuals, there is concurrent immune suppression. Rapid growth with or without ulceration is common. As in this case, telangiectatic papules and itching (on lower extremities) are reported, as well as papules, plaques, cystic or pedunculated lesions, and subcutaneous masses.3 Definitive diagnosis is confirmed by complete examination of skin and lymph nodes and a biopsy, which is triggered by a high level of clinical suspicion.4 Diagnosis is usually made when the median lesion diameter is 1.8 cm2.On pathologic examination with standard hematoxylin-eosin staining, MCC cells are typically basaloid and organized in crowded nests, demonstrating aggressive features: a finely granular salt-and-pepper chromatin pattern, scant cytoplasm, numerous mitotic figures, and necrosis. Cytokeratin 20 positivity together with thyroid transcription factor-1 negativity (ruling out skin metastasis from small cell lung cancer) and a neuroendocrine marker (synaptophysin, chromogranin) help to confirm the diagnosis of MCC.Even after optimal therapy for localized tumors, MCC often recurs (25%-50%).4 After recurrence, overall survival is poor, but the older age of these patients is seldom considered. In fact, disease-specific cumulative incidence of death in 5 years from recurrence is 30%.5Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA is found to be clonally integrated in up to 94% of MCCs.6 Mutant large T antigens are defective for viral replication but induce cell transformation, and T-cell recognition of T antigens is associated with better prognosis.7These observations have fostered the study of immune checkpoint inhibitors in MCC. In a phase 2 single-arm trial of avelumab, a fully human anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) IgG1 monoclonal antibody, that involved 88 pretreated patients with advanced MCC, the objective response rate (ORR) was 31.8% (95% CI, 21.9-43.1), including 8 complete and 20 partial responses; 23 responses were ongoing at the time of the report.8 In another study, avelumab was used as a  first-line treatment, and the ORR was 62% (18 of 29 patients; 95% CI, 42.3%-79.3%).9 Similar results were observed with pembrolizumab, a humanized anti-PD-1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody. In a phase 2 single-arm trial, the ORR was 56% (14 of 25 patients), with duration of response lasting up to 9.7 months.10 In these trials, immunotherapy was efficacious irrespective of tumor viral status. Notably, immune-related adverse events occurred in fewer than 20% of patients and were mostly grade 1 or 2.8,10 This patient began first-line treatment with avelumab.This case underscores the need for clinicians to suspect MCC (given its rising incidence) in the setting of a skin lesion with suggestive features (eg, fast growth, located on sun-exposed skin, older age) so that a biopsy can be obtained and diagnosis can be made in a timely manner.",497_G_o_o_f,"3

502,"Diffuse melanosis cutis (DMC) is a rare condition characterized by the hyperpigmentation of skin and mucous membranes caused by increased melanin deposition in patients with malignant melanoma.

Diffuse melanosis cutis presents more commonly in males (60% of cases) and white patients (95% of cases), with a median age at the time of diagnosis of about 50 years.1 This condition is also associated with melanuria in about 77% of cases.1 Usually, DMC is seen 12 months after an initial diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. Patients present with progressive and diffuse blue-gray hyperpigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, leading to darkening of the skin, hair, peritoneal fluid, sputum, urine, and sometimes the internal organs.2Histopathologic findings include deposition of perivascular histiocytes filled with melanin and free pigment in the dermal connective tissue. The underlying pathogenesis for this condition is not fully understood. According to one hypothesis, when metastatic melanoma undergoes lysis by ischemia, immunological responses, or oncologic treatments, cells release melanin precursors into the bloodstream that undergo auto-oxidation, become ingested by histiocytes, and are then deposited in the dermis.3 Another hypothesis suggests that tumor cells release melanocyte peptide growth factors such as α melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which might be responsible for DMC. The role immunotherapy played in the manifestation of DMC in this case is unclear. One case series of patients who developed DMC after immunotherapy initiation concluded that DMC may be a negative predictor of response to anti–PD-1 (programmed cell death 1) treatment.4 In particular, it remains unclear whether immunotherapy promotes DMC development or just cannot control DMC that would inevitably develop.The discoloration of DMC is most prominently noted in sun-exposed areas, progressing in a cephalocaudal direction.2 Diffuse melanosis cutis is an ominous sign that is associated with a worse prognosis, with a median survival of 4 to 6 months after diagnosis.1,5 According to case reports,5,6 novel therapies that target a BRAF mutation and immunotherapies have shown a considerable survival benefit.Based on the results of the biopsy specimen, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma.

510,"Histologic results of the biopsy revealed abundant perivascular infiltrates of small lymphocytes with admixed large cells and occasional plasma cells (Figure, B). Immunohistochemical staining showed large cells positive for CD20 (Figure, C), BCL6, and CD30, and negative for CD10, consistent with a diagnosis of polymorphic primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PCNS-PTLD).Initially described in 1968,1 PTLD is a potentially fatal complication of both solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The incidence of PTLD varies based on type of transplanted organ, immunosuppressive regimen, and patient characteristics. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder manifesting after solid organ transplant (SOT) occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of cases, with highest incidence in intestinal and multiple organ transplant recipients (5%-20%), followed by lung and heart transplant (2%-10%), and then pancreatic, renal, and liver transplant (1%-5%).2,3The World Health Organization divides PTLD into 3 pathologic categories: early lesions, polymorphic, and monomorphic, with monomorphic PTLD fulfilling the criteria for one of the B-cell or natural killer/T-cell neoplasms recognized in immunocompetent individuals.4 About 50% of PTLD cases are driven by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in the setting of immunosuppression and subsequent T-cell inhibition.5 This patient’s pathology was positive for EBV, confirmed by in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA; however, circulating EBV DNA was not detected in the serum.Primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder comprises 5% to 15% of all PTLD cases.6 Neuroradiographic findings of PCNS-PTLD are nonspecific and tend to have overlapping features with CNS infections and primary CNS lymphoma in immunocompromised individuals. Several case series7,8 report multicentric, contrast-enhancing, intra-axial lesions with extensive edema and marked expansion of the perivascular spaces.

The findings from a biopsy specimen of a lung lesion revealed small cell carcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer and began systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. Unfortunately, the patient died soon after the first dose of chemotherapy due to neutropenic sepsis.Cutaneous manifestation of an internal malignant neoplasm may present as direct infiltration into the skin or may present indirectly as a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS).1 The Curth postulates are the cornerstone for defining the association between internal malignant neoplasms and cutaneous disorders.1 Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a histopathologic term denoting vasculitis of the small vessels with predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate.2 After degranulation, the neutrophils undergo apoptosis, a process known as leukocytoclasis, releasing nuclear debris, which is also called nuclear dust.2 According to the consensus statement developed at the Chapel Hill Conference on Nomenclature of Systemic Vasculitis in 1994, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (CLV) is defined as an“[i]solated cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis without systemic vasculitis or glomerulonephritis.”2,3 As a PNS, CLV is the most commonly diagnosed vasculitis (45%) followed by polyarteritis nodosa (36.7%).4 Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis occurs most frequently with hematologic cancers followed by lung, gastrointestinal, or urinary tract tumors.5,6 Approximately 20% to 26% of patients with paraneoplastic CLV have lung cancer.4,6 Among lung cancers, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell are most commonly associated with CLV.4,6,7Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis presents as a palpable purpuric lesion that usually involves the dependent areas (mostly feet and lower extremities) and rarely involves the upper extremities and trunk.2 The lesions are usually chronic and persistent when associated with a malignant neoplasm.2 In contrast to the chronic pattern of CLV, Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a recurring form of CLV that presents with symptom-free intervals.3,8 Deposits of IgA in the blood vessels are a defining feature of HSP. Henoch-Schönlein purpura usually affects children and has been reported as a PNS associated with solid organ malignant neoplasms, including small cell lung cancer.2,9 The diagnostic workup includes a skin biopsy to differentiate other cutaneous lesions from underlying vasculitis. Preferably, an immunofluorescence stain should be done in addition to a hematoxylin and eosin stain.2 However, the diagnostic yield of this test is considerably reduced after 48 hours owing to the destruction and removal of immunoglobulins deposited in the vessel wall.2 Judicious use of immunofluorescence for selected cases has been advocated recently, but the test is not readily available in settings with constrained resources, such as ours.10 In patients with chronic CLV, other causes not related to malignant neoplasms should be excluded, including hepatitis B and/or C virus, HIV, cryoglobulinemia, and systemic small-vessel vasculitis.The pathogenesis of CLV remains anecdotal. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a common response to circulating aggressors, be it microorganisms or immune complexes, and is likely influenced by the heterogeneity of the endothelium of postcapillary venules.2 The endothelial cells in these venules play a role in antigen presentation, and express Toll-like receptor family members, CD32 molecules, and histamine H1 receptors.2 Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis usually begins with deposition of immune complex in the vessel walls, leading to activation of the complement cascade (complement components C3a and C5a), which attracts neutrophils and eventually leads to degranulation and vessel wall destruction.2 The treatment of CLV associated with systemic malignant neoplasms is directed toward the primary cause, whereby improvement or worsening of the rash is seen in concordance with the treatment response of the underlying cancer.1,4 This case illustrates the importance of recognizing cutaneous manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes, which can prompt an early diagnosis of an occult malignant neoplasm.",517_G_o_o_f,"3

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a common response to circulating aggressors, be it microorganisms or immune complexes, and is likely influenced by the heterogeneity of the endothelium of postcapillary venules.2 The endothelial cells in these venules play a role in antigen presentation, and express Toll-like receptor family members, CD32 molecules, and histamine H1 receptors.2 Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis usually begins with deposition of immune complex in the vessel walls, leading to activation of the complement cascade (complement components C3a and C5a), which attracts neutrophils and eventually leads to degranulation and vessel wall destruction.2 The treatment of CLV associated with systemic malignant neoplasms is directed toward the primary cause, whereby improvement or worsening of the rash is seen in concordance with the treatment response of the underlying cancer.1,4 This case illustrates the importance of recognizing cutaneous manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes, which can prompt an early diagnosis of an occult malignant neoplasm.",517_G_a_m_f,"2

517,"The histopathologic findings from a lesional skin biopsy specimen revealed neutrophilic infiltration of the small blood vessels in the skin along with necrosis and extravasation of the red blood cells (Figure, C). The findings from a biopsy specimen of a lung lesion revealed small cell carcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer and began systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. Unfortunately, the patient died soon after the first dose of chemotherapy due to neutropenic sepsis.Cutaneous manifestation of an internal malignant neoplasm may present as direct infiltration into the skin or may present indirectly as a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS).1 The Curth postulates are the cornerstone for defining the association between internal malignant neoplasms and cutaneous disorders.1 Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a histopathologic term denoting vasculitis of the small vessels with predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate.2 After degranulation, the neutrophils undergo apoptosis, a process known as leukocytoclasis, releasing nuclear debris, which is also called nuclear dust.2 According to the consensus statement developed at the Chapel Hill Conference on Nomenclature of Systemic Vasculitis in 1994, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (CLV) is defined as an“[i]solated cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis without systemic vasculitis or glomerulonephritis.”2,3 As a PNS, CLV is the most commonly diagnosed vasculitis (45%) followed by polyarteritis nodosa (36.7%).4 Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis occurs most frequently with hematologic cancers followed by lung, gastrointestinal, or urinary tract tumors.5,6 Approximately 20% to 26% of patients with paraneoplastic CLV have lung cancer.4,6 Among lung cancers, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell are most commonly associated with CLV.4,6,7Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis presents as a palpable purpuric lesion that usually involves the dependent areas (mostly feet and lower extremities) and rarely involves the upper extremities and trunk.2 The lesions are usually chronic and persistent when associated with a malignant neoplasm.2 In contrast to the chronic pattern of CLV, Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a recurring form of CLV that presents with symptom-free intervals.3,8 Deposits of IgA in the blood vessels are a defining feature of HSP. Henoch-Schönlein purpura usually affects children and has been reported as a PNS associated with solid organ malignant neoplasms, including small cell lung cancer.2,9 The diagnostic workup includes a skin biopsy to differentiate other cutaneous lesions from underlying vasculitis.

The clinical presentation of the patient, including the generalized rash with palpable purpura, pedal edema, and the absence of systemic symptoms, suggests a vascular process. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase level indicate an inflammatory process, which aligns with cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The presence of a spiculated lung mass and bilateral adrenal masses raises concern for an underlying malignancy, which can be associated with this type of vasculitis.

The endemic type is mostly associated with EBV and frequently affects jaw and other facial bones of African children aged 4 to 7 years.3 The sporadic and immunodeficiency-associated subtypes are more common in adults and frequently present with extranodal (particularly gastrointestinal tract) involvement.2 Sporadic types often do not show the rearrangement of the c-Myc and immunoglobulin genes, and EBV positivity is seen in less than 15% to 30% patients. Immunodeficiency type is observed in patients with HIV infection, allograft recipients, and patients with primary immunodeficiency. It is more frequent in patients with CD4 cell counts of 200/μL or higher, and EBV positivity is observed in 40% of patients or more.4 Burkitt lymphoma is composed of monomorphic, intermediate-sized, mature B cells, which are positive for CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a, CD10, and Bcl6 but negative for CD5 and Bcl2, with abundant mitotic figures and a typical starry-sky appearance on histologic analysis.2 The genetic hallmark of BL is overexpression of c-Myc, which drives its pathogenesis.5Cutaneous presentation of BL is rare and mostly attributed to hematogenous spread, local invasion, or iatrogenic seeding of malignant cells through surgical procedures.6 This case showed evidence of regional metastases on the same side of the chest, back, and abdomen, not directly communicating with the main tumor. These, in our opinion, represent extensions of tumor via lymphatics as evidenced by predominant subcutaneous tissue involvement in the patient.1,7The main differential diagnoses of BL include other high-grade B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Immunohistochemical features that favor BL over DLBCL are CD10+, Bcl6+, Bcl2−, and TdT−, with a Ki-67 index close to 100%.8 Dysregulation of c-Myc can occur as a primary event in BL or as a secondary event in 5% to 15% of patients with DLBCL and 30% to 50% of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas unclassified with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL. Secondary c-Myc changes occur often against a background of complex karyotype and often confer aggressive clinical behavior, including poor survival rate and increased risk of relapse in the central nervous system. The adverse prognosis arises because of concurrent BCL2 (OMIM 151430) or BCL6 (OMIM 109565) gene rearrangements, which are subsequently termed double- or triple-hit lymphomas.8Leukemia cutis can be easily ruled out based on characteristic histologic and immunohistochemical findings.9 AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma appears more erythematous-violaceous and has characteristic histopathologic features with vascular proliferation, slitlike spaces, and solid cords and fascicles of spindle cells interspersed between vascular channels.10In conclusion, cutaneous BL is rare, and the diagnosis is mainly confirmed by histopathologic analysis; however, the rapid increase in the size of lesions in this patient was an important clinical clue.",535_G_o_o_m,"2

Risk factors include fair complexion; a history of intense, intermittent sun exposure; immunosuppression; and a positive family history. Radiation exposure may be especially carcinogenic in inducing BCC, and BCC is more likely than squamous cell carcinoma to develop following radiation exposure, with the greatest risk seen in patients who were younger than 10 years when exposed.1 Furthermore, several genetic syndromes are associated with an increased risk of multiple BCCs, including basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS).Basal cell nevus syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations of genes involved in the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, most often mutations of PTCH1, a tumor suppressor.2,3 In addition to multiple BCCs, which typically develop during late adolescence to early adulthood, other classic manifestations include odontogenic keratocysts of the jaw, palmoplantar pits, calcification of the falx cerebri, and skeletal anomalies.4-6 Other neoplasms, specifically, medulloblastoma, meningioma, and cardiac and bilateral ovarian fibromas, are also associated with BCNS. Although diagnosed at an earlier age and in multiplicity, BCCs associated with BCNS usually have a similar natural history and predilection for sun-exposed areas as seen in patients without the syndrome.

The axons of first-order neurons within the hypothalamus project through nerve tracts of the brainstem and the lateral gray column of the spinal cord.2 The preganglionic nerve fibers from T1 through T4 spinal cord levels join the sympathetic trunk, traveling in close proximity to the apex of the lung before synapsing in the superior cervical ganglion.2 Postganglionic fibers from third-order neurons then form a nerve plexus and surround the common carotid and downstream vessels to supply sympathetic innervation to the head and neck.2Although absence of function, as seen in Horner’s syndrome, is more commonly reported,1 sympathetic hyperactivity may be a sequela of injury to autonomic nerves as they traverse the thoracic cavity. Hyperhidrosis caused by a comorbid condition, also known as secondary hyperhidrosis, has been the focus of about 3 dozen case reports over the past 70 years.3 Most commonly, these findings have been reported in the context of mesothelioma,4,5 often affecting multiple dermatomes and usually involving the thorax.4,6 Symptoms are typically reported as occurring ipsilateral to the tumor7; however, contralateral dysfunction has also been described.6 In a case report detailed by Walsh et al,8 the pathophysiology of the hyperhidrosis in a patient with an apical lung tumor with ipsilateral hyperhidrosis of the face, arm, and antecubital fossa was postulated to be because of invasion of sympathetic nerves leading to irritation of the nerve fibers and increased signaling. Furthermore, in a patient with a primary central nervous system tumor compressing the thoracic spinal cord and ipsilateral hemifacial hyperhidrosis that resolved after decompression, Kilinçer et al9 attributed the patient’s symptoms to irritation of sympathetic nerves.

The primary tumor was a rapidly progressing left apical lung cancer with associated flushing and hyperhidrosis limited to the left forehead. On review of the literature, we propose that his symptoms were the result of irritation of the second-order neuron of the left sympathetic trunk prior to synapse in the superior cervical ganglion. We suspect this injury may have occurred through compression by the enlarging tumor or even direct nerve invasion. Because the patient had a limited area of involvement, with seemingly normal sympathetic tone in the lower face and neck, we presume the tumor only affected a portion of the nerve.The patient was started on a palliative course of radiation for his complaint of chest pain with plans for subsequent chemotherapy.

The patient's symptoms of constant, bothersome sweating on the left forehead, along with the presence of a large left upper lobe mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, suggest a disruption of sympathetic nerve function. The impingement of the left sympathetic trunk is likely causing Horner's syndrome, which can lead to sweating abnormalities on the affected side of the face. This is consistent with the findings of the tumor's proximity to the sympathetic trunk as indicated in the imaging. The other options, such as transection or invasion of the right cervical ganglion, do not align with the unilateral sweating observed. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate explanation for the patient's symptoms.",,,,,,

Hyperhidrosis may be evaluated though sweat testing using the 1-step iodine-starch method, which demarks perspiring skin using a colorimetric indicator.10 Radiation therapy has been reported to be successful in abating symptoms in some patients.3,8 Interestingly, in mesothelioma, hyperhidrosis has been proposed to be a prognostic indicator, suggesting poor outcomes in patients with this complaint.8The patient presented here was diagnosed with a stage IV, T4N3M1c adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe of the lung metastatic to the liver. The primary tumor was a rapidly progressing left apical lung cancer with associated flushing and hyperhidrosis limited to the left forehead. On review of the literature, we propose that his symptoms were the result of irritation of the second-order neuron of the left sympathetic trunk prior to synapse in the superior cervical ganglion. We suspect this injury may have occurred through compression by the enlarging tumor or even direct nerve invasion. Because the patient had a limited area of involvement, with seemingly normal sympathetic tone in the lower face and neck, we presume the tumor only affected a portion of the nerve.The patient was started on a palliative course of radiation for his complaint of chest pain with plans for subsequent chemotherapy.

The patient's symptoms of constant, bothersome sweating on the left forehead, along with the presence of a large left upper lobe mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, suggest a disruption of sympathetic nerve function.

586,"Apical lung cancers with sympathetic nerve involvement may manifest with Horner’s syndrome, the classic triad of miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis.1 Eccrine sweat function and thermoregulation of the face is modulated by the sympathetic nervous system via 3-neuron autonomic relays. The axons of first-order neurons within the hypothalamus project through nerve tracts of the brainstem and the lateral gray column of the spinal cord.2 The preganglionic nerve fibers from T1 through T4 spinal cord levels join the sympathetic trunk, traveling in close proximity to the apex of the lung before synapsing in the superior cervical ganglion.2 Postganglionic fibers from third-order neurons then form a nerve plexus and surround the common carotid and downstream vessels to supply sympathetic innervation to the head and neck.2Although absence of function, as seen in Horner’s syndrome, is more commonly reported,1 sympathetic hyperactivity may be a sequela of injury to autonomic nerves as they traverse the thoracic cavity. Hyperhidrosis caused by a comorbid condition, also known as secondary hyperhidrosis, has been the focus of about 3 dozen case reports over the past 70 years.3 Most commonly, these findings have been reported in the context of mesothelioma,4,5 often affecting multiple dermatomes and usually involving the thorax.4,6 Symptoms are typically reported as occurring ipsilateral to the tumor7; however, contralateral dysfunction has also been described.6 In a case report detailed by Walsh et al,8 the pathophysiology of the hyperhidrosis in a patient with an apical lung tumor with ipsilateral hyperhidrosis of the face, arm, and antecubital fossa was postulated to be because of invasion of sympathetic nerves leading to irritation of the nerve fibers and increased signaling. Furthermore, in a patient with a primary central nervous system tumor compressing the thoracic spinal cord and ipsilateral hemifacial hyperhidrosis that resolved after decompression, Kilinçer et al9 attributed the patient’s symptoms to irritation of sympathetic nerves.

597,"Inguinal hernias are one of the most common surgical diseases and account for up to 28% of all elective surgical cases performed in the United States.1 Because other diseases may mimic this condition, it is important to recognize other pathologies, as treatment may be different. Saphena varix may also present as a “groin bulge,” but it is a dilation of the saphenous vein due to valvular incompetence. Amyand hernia is an inguinal hernia containing the appendix. Therefore, an appendectomy may also be indicated at the time of inguinal hernia repair. Communicating hydrocele is when fluid flows between the scrotum and peritoneal cavity because of a patent processus vaginalis. Sliding hernias occur when a retroperitoneal organ constitutes part of the hernia sac.Sliding hernias that contain the bladder occur in about 1% to 4%2 of cases. The incidence of inguinal hernias containing ureter is extremely rare,3 and as of 2013, fewer than 140 cases have been reported.4 Associated bladder herniation is present in 25% of cases with inguinal hernias containing the ureter.5 Severe complications, such as renal failure, have been reported because of ureteral herniation, which is why it is crucial to identify these types of hernias. Comorbidities, such a liver dysfunction, can further complicate hernia repair and postoperative outcomes. In this case, the patient had a sliding hernia with the bladder and the right ureter constituting a portion of the hernia sac, resulting in right hydroureter and hydronephrosis and frequent urinary tract infections.Risk factors for bladder herniation include older age, male sex, obesity, previous herniorrhaphy, and lower urinary tract obstruction, such as in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Most of these are asymptomatic and diagnosed intraoperatively.6 Ureteral hernias most often occur on the right side and can present with abdominal pain, renal colic, or obstructive uropathy.5 Imaging scans to identify bladder and/or ureteral inguinal hernias include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, a pyelogram, and/or a cystogram,2 which are important to obtain so that in addition to operative planning any additional anatomic abnormalities, such as ectopic kidneys, can be detected. Surgical repair is indicated in cases in which the bladder and/or ureter are contained within the hernia sac, because if they are left untreated, it can lead to complications, such as renal failure or urosepsis. It must be noted that when these cases are diagnosed intraoperatively, the operating surgeon must be alert as to not inadvertently injure these structures, which can occur in up to 12% of cases.7Complications due to a fully or partially obstructed bladder and/or ureter in an inguinal hernia can be fully reversed after surgical intervention and can have a dramatic improvement in the quality of life. For example, the resolution of frequent urinary tract infections and hydroureter/hydronephrosis that was noted on postoperative ultrasonography results allowed this patient to return to a normal lifestyle. The involvement of multidisciplinary teams, such as general surgeons and urologists, can aid in workup (ie, cystoscopy) and surgical intervention (ie, bladder or ureteral resection or repair if needed). Additionally, malignancy of the bladder or prostate has been reported in up to 11.2% of patients with bladder herniation.

The tissue samples from the thyroid gland and the first thoracic vertebral body were suggestive of papillary thyroid cancer. Four weeks later, he underwent a total thyroidectomy and central compartment lymph node dissection (Figure 2).Thyroid cancer is the fastest-growing cancer in the United States. A small proportion of differentiated thyroid cancers present with bone metastases (2%-13%).1 The prognosis in localized differentiated thyroid cancer is good, with 97% of patients  surviving to 10 years. Ten-year survival is reduced by at least 14% in the presence of osseous metastases.1 The frequency of skeletal metastases is highest to the spine and pelvis.1 Most of these patients have follicular thyroid cancer.1 Although cervical cord compression from the direct extension of papillary thyroid cancer to the cervical spine has been reported, metastases to the spine from localized papillary thyroid cancer are uncommon.2,3 Multiple bone metastases have been noted as more common than single bone lesions.3 Distant metastases in the setting of well-differentiated thyroid cancer without neck swelling are extremely rare4; when they occur, osseous and pulmonary metastases are the most frequent sites.4Therapeutic options for patients with spinal metastases from well-differentiated thyroid cancer include radioiodine therapy, pharmacological treatment with bisphosphonates, surgical resection of the primary cancer, and standard or minimally invasive spine surgery.5,6 A multidisciplinary approach is required to achieve goals of care, which are primarily to control pain, stabilize neurological function, and achieve local disease control.6In this case, the initial priority was to stabilize the cervical spine, after which the primary cancer was resected. A sternotomy was required for optimal exposure. The final pathology on the resected specimen showed a tumor with papillary features; however, this was noted to be poorly differentiated and classified as an insular thyroid cancer. This is a rare thyroid malignant subtype, often characterized by an advanced stage at initial presentation and an aggressive course.7The patient recovered from surgery and underwent radioiodine ablative therapy. In addition to the spinal disease, he was noted to have multiple subcentimeter pulmonary nodules that raised concerns about metastases. The presence of both pulmonary and skeletal metastases significantly reduces long-term survival in patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer.8 Pulmonary metastases in young patients have been associated with a 10-year survival rate of 50%; in contrast, no patients with skeletal metastases survived this long.8 The principal determinants of long-term survival in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer are age, the site of distant metastases, and whether the metastatic lesions take up radioactive iodine.8Thyroid cancer and neck pain are common clinical problems. However, this case uniquely describes a presentation of spinal metastases with neck pain in the setting of a large mediastinal malignant thyroid mass, with the unusual feature of no visible or palpable neck swelling.",643_G_a_n_m,"3  
Gender is moderately relevant in this case as certain conditions, such as thyroid disorders, are more prevalent in females, which could influence the diagnostic considerations. Additionally, understanding gender-specific health trends can guide medical decisions and patient management, particularly in the context of potential compressive symptoms from a thyroid goiter.","A  
The patient's symptoms of worsening neck and shoulder pain, along with paresthesia radiating down the right arm, suggest a compressive issue in the cervical region. The presence of tracheal deviation noted on the plain radiograph indicates a possible mass effect, which is consistent with a thyroid goiter. The absence of trauma and the lack of weakness or significant neurological deficits further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's age and the nature of the symptoms align with a thyroid goiter causing compressive symptoms rather than a fracture or malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is a thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms.",,,,,,
650,"Nuclear protein in testis (NUT) midline carcinoma (NMC) is a rare aggressive human cancer that presents as a poorly differentiated carcinoma originating from midline locations and does not arise from any specific tissue type or organ.1 NUT midline carcinoma is driven by a rearrangement of the NUT gene (OMIM 608963) located on chromosome 15. This rearrangement commonly occurs between the NUT gene and a member of the BET genes family, most commonly BRD4 (OMIM 608749), resulting in the formation of the fusion oncogene BRD4-NUT.2,3 NUT midline carcinoma is extremely aggressive, with most cases presenting at an advanced stage as widely metastatic and unresectable disease when diagnosed,3,4 and has a highly lethal course.5The tumor arises in many sites, although large series suggest predilection for the head and neck and mediastinum.4 Existing literature suggests that primary pulmonary NMC is exceptionally rare and has shorter median survival when compared with the median survival reported for NMC arising at all sites (2.2 vs 6.7 months). This difference has been hypothesized to be partly owing to a relatively delayed onset of clinical symptoms for primary tumors of the lung compared with the other more common sites, for instance, the head and neck. The estimated 2-year progression-free survival is 9% based on studies incorporating all sites of disease.4From a histopathologic perspective, the appearance is commonly that of a poorly differentiated carcinoma with focal, abrupt squamous differentiation. The NMC cells are usually medium sized and round and often monomorphic in appearance in contrast to many other poorly differentiated carcinomas, which consist of highly pleomorphic large cells. These features are characteristic although not diagnostic.6 Reactivity of CD34 is occasionally seen.5The patient’s age was very unusual for conventional pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma, which is typically a disease of older patients who smoke. This characteristic, along with the characteristic histologic findings, raised the possibility of NMC.

NUT midline carcinoma is more common among young patients, with a median age of 30 years at the time of diagnosis.4By the time the diagnosis was established, the patient had developed significant right shoulder pain. He started chemotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for each). He experienced meaningful improvement in symptoms and was pain free without use of narcotics 24 hours after cycle 1. However, during the following weeks, he slowly developed worsening skeletal pain and recurrent pleural effusions requiring placement of a pleural catheter (PleurX; Becton, Dickinson and Company). Palliative radiotherapy of 2500 cGy to the right humerus in 5 fractions provided modest pain relief. He then received cycle 2 of chemotherapy delayed by 2 weeks with no clinical evidence of response, continued skeletal pain, and recurrent effusions. Radiotherapy of 800 cGy delivered in a single fraction to the right hemithorax 3 weeks later was of limited benefit.

It is associated with critical illness and cardiovascular disease. Occlusive causes are rarer and predominantly attributable to large arterial atherosclerotic disease with distal thromboembolism (spontaneous or after vascular procedures), cardiac arrhythmias with embolism of atrial thrombus, small arterial disease in patients with diabetes, or venous outflow obstruction from hypercoagulable states.3 Resultant segmental ischemia often occurs at watershed areas. The cecum may also represent a watershed area4 owing to its end arterial supply from the anterior and posterior cecal arteries. In most patients, there is dual arterial inflow from a vascular arcade that bridges the ileal and colic branches of the ileocolic artery5; however, the rare anatomical variant of a singular inflow off the colic branch may predispose these patients to ischemia.6 The appendix, terminal ileum, and ascending colon have multiple arterial sources, which may explain why these are at lesser risk of ischemia.Isolated cecal ischemia most commonly manifests as acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, leukocytosis, and nonspecific imaging findings of cecal wall thickening with adjacent fat stranding.

Cutaneous and sinus tissue cultures similarly yielded Mucorales species, reflecting a disseminated angioinvasive mucormycosis infection. Imaging results were negative for pulmonary invasion. Combination antifungal therapy with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B, posaconazole, and micafungin was initiated, and excision was undertaken. Induction therapy was reinstated 24 days later.A, Punch biopsy specimen from the left lower back (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×10). Note the dermal necrosis and infiltrative hyphae. Arrowheads indicate the nonseptate broad-branching hyphae. B, Punch biopsy specimen from the left lower back (periodic acid–Schiff stain, original magnification ×20). Arrowheads indicate the nonseptate broad-branching hyphae.Mucormycosis comprises fungal infections of the class Zygomycota and the order Mucorales. Rhizopus species represent the most frequently isolated causative organism that microscopically appears as nonseptate, broad-branching hyphae. These organisms are omnipresent in nature and are rarely pathogenic in immunocompetent patients.Mucormycosis is a medical emergency that presents opportunistically in patients with immunosuppression, neutropenia, and hyperglycemia.1 Mucormycosis has angioinvasive capacity, leading to vascular thrombosis that results in tissue infarction.2 Tissue infarction manifests as a hyperemic, violaceous, or black cutaneous plaque. Infections that involve the nasal, sinus, orbital, and brain tissues are characteristic and confer a high mortality rate. Clinical signs include fever, nasal ulceration or necrosis, periorbital swelling, sinusitis, or headache.3 Mortality from mucormycosis varies on the degree of involvement. A systematic review4 of 929 cases of mucormycosis found a mortality rate of 46% among patients with sinus involvement, 76% among those with pulmonary involvement, and 96% for disseminated infection.High-risk newborns, patients with hematologic malignant tumors, and patients with congenital metabolic abnormalities constitute risk factors frequently seen in the pediatric population.5,6 The most common pattern of presentation of pediatric mucormycosis is cutaneous, followed by gastrointestinal, rhinocerebral, and pulmonary. Thirty-two percent of all cases are disseminated.5 Cutaneous mucormycosis usually results from direct inoculation of spores into traumatized dermis but can also be from intravenous catheter placement, injections, and surgery.7Leukemia cutis presents as firm red-brown nodules and is more likely to occur in acute myelogenous leukemia than in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rapidly progressive neutrophilic dermatosis that presents with cutaneous ulceration with a violaceous border and undermined edges. Brown recluse spider bites result in painful hemorrhagic bullae surrounded by erythema that may be associated with nausea, myalgia, and diaphoresis. In the setting of neutropenia and a dark painless plaque, an opportunistic infection, such as mucormycosis, should be suspected.Pediatric mucormycosis portends a poor prognosis.

This disease can manifest as a single nodule, the localized type, or as an extensive synovial proliferation with villous and nodular shapes, the diffuse form.2 Although symptoms are not always directly associated with the extension of disease, diffuse-type TGCT usually causes pain, stiffness, secondary osteoarthritis, and reduced quality of life, whereas patients with localized TGCT are often asymptomatic.2,3The diagnosis of TGCT is mainly based on the combination of clinical and radiologic presentation, and histologic confirmation is not always required. Appearance on MRI is relatively specific, and thus this examination is essential in the diagnostic workup. The lesion is typically intra-articular and appears as an inhomogeneous mass with low- to intermediate-intensity signal on T1- and T2-weighted images. The low-intensity T2-weighted signal is attributable to hemosiderin deposits within the pathologic tissue. The diffuse type shows numerous solid nodules or villi along the synovium and is often associated with a large joint effusion. In long-standing lesions, bone erosions, extension outside the joint, and secondary arthritis often occur.4From literature data, TGCT shows consistently increased uptake in FDG-PET in the localized and diffuse types owing to its highly active inflammatory component, with SUVmax values ranging from 4.0 to 17.0 (Figure 2).5 Therefore, this disease can be easily mistaken for a malignant neoplasm, for example when FDG-PET is performed for staging, as in the current case. Owing to the routine use of FDG-PET as a staging study, reports of incidental findings of TGCTs mimicking malignant neoplasms are becoming more frequent.6,7Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography in a patient with Ewing sarcoma show high uptake of contrast material (maximum standard uptake variable [SUVmax], 8.4) in the right thigh (black arrowhead) and a second area (SUVmax, 12.0) in the left ankle (red arrowhead).Surgical excision of the pathologic tissue is the standard treatment of TGCT and is usually curative for the localized form. In the diffuse type, multiple and invasive surgical procedures often lead to significant adverse effects and the risk for recurrence is high.3 Radiotherapy or radiosynovectomy have been proposed as alternatives but are also associated with adverse effects and poor local control. Therefore, during the past few years, interest in potential target treatments for diffuse-type TGCT has increased, especially since the finding of overexpression of colony-stimulating factor 1 in this neoplasm.8 Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including small molecules and antibodies against colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, are currently under investigation and have shown promising results in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.9,10 In the near future, FDG-PET might become a useful tool to assess the metabolic response to these potential new treatments.",687_G_o_o_f,"3

Pathognomonic signs and symptoms of this condition are decreasing size of scrotal swelling after voiding and the need to manually compress the scrotum to empty the bladder.5 Scrotal cystocele should be correctly diagnosed because its delayed repair may cause many complications, including hydronephrosis, stone formation in the herniated bladder, urinary tract infections, bilateral vesicoureteral reflux, and vesicocutaneous fistula.6 Several surgical approaches have been described for treating scrotal cystocele.

The patient's history of myelodysplastic syndrome and the specific characteristics of the skin lesions align with BPDCN, which can arise in patients with prior hematologic malignancies. Other options, such as primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma or transformed mycosis fungoides, do not fit the immunophenotype or clinical context as well as BPDCN. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.",,,,,,
703,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare clonal disorder comprising 0.7% of cutaneous lymphomas.1 Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is categorized as an independent entity to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)2 and it may occur as an isolated disease or in the presence of other hematologic malignant abnormalities including AML, MDS, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in 10% to 20% of cases.1 Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm typically occurs in the elderly population (median age, 60-70 years), and it is more common in men (2.5-3.5:1.0).3Although BPDCN can involve any body site including lymph node, spleen, and liver, the most common sites are skin and bone marrow.4 Accordingly, patients commonly present with cutaneous lesions as brown or purple nodules (73%), bruise-like patches (12%), disseminated or mixed lesions (14%).4 Cytopenia (thrombocytopenia, 78%; anemia, 65%; neutropenia, 34%) is common in the presence of bone marrow involvment.4 Overt leukemia with circulating BPDCN cells could be the first manifestation in advanced cases.4Cutaneous lesions in BPDCN may mimic lesions of leukemia cutis, cutaneous CMML, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or Langerhans cell histiocytosis, rendering it a diagnostic challenge. Notably, BPDCN typically show dense dermal infiltration of small-to-medium sized immature cells with plasmacytoid appearance and elongated cytoplasmic tails. Results of immunohistochemical analyses are typically positive for CD4, CD56, CD45RA, CD123, TCL1, BDCA-2, TCF-4/E2-2, and BDCA-4, and results for CD3, CD11c, CD14, CD19, CD57, CD117, and myeloperoxidase are negative. Results for CD8, CD20, CD34, PAX5, Epstein-Barr virus, and T-cell receptor proteins are uniformly negative.The pathogenesis of BPDCN and its relationship to other hematologic disorders remain elusive. Its immunophenotypic resemblance to plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) and higher proliferation index suggest that BPDCN originates from PDCs. Recent genetic studies demonstrated BPDCN shares many mutations in common (TET2, 80%; ASXL1, 32%; NRAS, 27.3%; TP53) with other myeloid disorders,5 and abnormal karyotypes such as 5q, 6q, 12p, 13q, and 15q have been reported in 50% to 65% of cases.6The clinical outcome of BPDCN remains dismal, with median overall survival (OS) of 12 to 14 months.3 Advanced age is an adverse prognostic factor, and no survival difference was observed between cutaneous vs systemic BPDCN.7 There is no standard care established given its rarity. A retrospective study3 showed that regimens for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas such as hyper-CVAD (including course A [cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone] and course B [methotrexate and cytarabine]) or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) had superior outcomes compared with AML regimens (66.6% vs 26.9% complete remission [CR] rate; P = .02; median OS, 12.3 vs 7.1 months; P = .02). Therefore, ALL-like induction chemotherapies are recommended along with central nervous system prophylaxis or therapy. A recent phase 2 clinical trial of SL-401, a recombinant interleukin 3 genetically fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin, demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 95%, a CR of 79%, and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.5 months in the front-line setting, enabling successful bridging to allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) in 44% of patients.8 Disease relapse is common (median relapse time 9 months) regardless of types of treatments.4 Therefore, allo-SCT is recommended in patients who achieve CR/partial response after induction therapies. In a large retrospective study, 3-year OS rate was 41% in patients treated with allo-SCT, and there was no relapse observed 27 months after allo-SCT, suggesting that allo-SCT could be potentially curative.9 Another study10 showed significantly higher 3-year OS rate (74% vs 0%, P < .001) in patients who received allo-SCT in their first CR vs not in CR1, further emphasizing the benefit of allo-SCT. The optimal therapy for refractory/relapsed BPDCN is poorly defined. The SL-401 study showed an ORR of 69%, a CR rate of 31%, and median PFS 3.6 months in the refractory/relapsed settings.8 Currently, a variety of agents including BCL-2 inhibitors are under clinical development.This patient was treated with hyper-CVAD with complete resolution of skin lesions; however, the patient developed disease relapse and was subsequently treated with SL-401. Unfortunately, he had progression of disease and died after further chemotherapies.",703_G_a_n_m,"1  
Gender has minimal impact in this case, as the clinical presentation and diagnosis of cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm are not significantly influenced by the patient's gender. While certain hematologic malignancies may have gender predispositions, the specific diagnosis and treatment considerations here are primarily based on the disease characteristics rather than gender-related factors.","A

The immunohistochemical profile showing neoplastic cells positive for CD4, CD33, CD43, CD56, and CD123, along with a high Ki-67 proliferation index, aligns with BPDCN characteristics. The patient's history of myelodysplastic syndrome and the absence of circulating blasts further support this diagnosis, as BPDCN can arise in patients with hematologic malignancies.

In cases of blunt trauma, when CT is often used to diagnose injury, vicarious excretion of iodinated contrast medium can cause diagnostic error and subsequent unnecessary testing or intervention.

When contrast medium is injected to obtain an intravenous pyelogram or angiogram, such as with protocoled CT for trauma, we expect to see renal excretion of the contrast medium on delayed-phase images.

Because of early recognition that the imaging artifact was attributable to VCME rather than to active hemorrhage, the patient was spared errors in diagnosis or misguided interventions.This case highlights how imaging artifacts caused by VCME may be misleading and could result in misdiagnosis or unwarranted procedures.

718,"Children with aggression and self-injury are frequently referred to child psychiatrists for management of acute behavioral issues. Fully treating these problem behaviors in ASD requires a careful evaluation of co-occurring medical and psychiatric disorders, developmental and family history, as well as an assessment for communication difficulties, maladaptive reinforcement patterns, and psychosocial stressors.1The 4-year-old boy described in this case had significantly impairing social communication deficits that arose early in development combined with patterns of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, the cardinal criteria of ASD (as described in DSM-5, criteria A-D). He demonstrated language impairment, motor skills delay, and suspected cognitive deficits. He also has at least 2 identifiable risk factors for a neurodevelopmental disorder: (1) premature birth and (2) 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.A careful medical evaluation in collaboration with his other clinicians ruled out medical problems that would account for his behavior. His behavior had been quite consistent over the past year and there were no recent psychosocial stressors. In the absence of other medical, psychiatric, or psychosocial factors, his behaviors most likely relate to the diagnosis of ASD with outbursts secondary to (1) deficient communication and (2) decreased tolerance for change and frustration.Behavioral intervention is first-line treatment for aggressive behavior in young children, and therapy based on the principles of applied behavior analysis has extensive empirical support in ASD. Several treatment models exist, including standard applied behavior analysis , pivotal response training, and the Early Start Denver Model. Parallel parent-training components can provide additional benefits. A functional behavioral assessment to identify triggers and understand the function of the behavior can help implement a behavioral intervention plan to decrease the target behavior, in this case, aggression and self-injury. While this patient benefitted from school-based therapies, he had not yet received applied behavior analysis –specific or other behavioral therapies at the time of evaluation. Unfortunately, access to behavioral interventions is often limited by a scarcity of trained clinicians.It is critical to evaluate the immediate safety concerns of each patient and determine whether the risk of injury to the patient or others justifies a trial of a medication to reduce the risk of injury.1 In these cases, medications should be carefully considered. Atypical antipsychotic medications have the best evidence for treating aggression and self-injurious behavior in children with ASD. Based on multiple randomized clinical trials,2 risperidone and aripiprazole were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of “irritability associated with autistic disorder” in children as young as 5 and 6 years old, respectively. The “irritability” target symptom definition was based on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability/Agitation/Crying subscale, which indexes aggression and self-injury as well as tantrums, crying, mood swings, and irritability. In any child, symptoms must be substantial to merit using this medication in the context of the potential adverse effects, which include sedation and an increased risk for movement disorders. Mixed receptor antagonists, such as risperidone and aripiprazole, are also associated with substantial weight gain and related medical problems, including type 2 diabetes. The addition of metformin has shown efficacy in reducing weight gain in children with ASD who are taking risperidone or aripiprazole.3 Some genetic conditions (including chromosome 16p11.2 deletion syndrome) are also associated with an increased risk of obesity,4 and aripiprazole may therefore be preferred over risperidone. While multiple lines of evidence point to abnormalities of the serotonin system in ASD, serotonin reuptake inhibitors do not show the same pattern of benefit in children with ASD that they provide in obsessive compulsive disorder; for example, a large randomized clinical trial of citalopram for repetitive behavior in ASD showed no overall significant benefits and increased adverse effects.5Autism spectrum disorder is an extremely heterogeneous disorder that appears to be a common final outcome of several factors, including genetic risk alleles, environmental insults, and developmental events.6 While chromosomal microarray testing can identify a clinically relevant genetic change in up to 10% of people with autism,7 in most cases we do not yet have evidence-based guidelines to clinically act on these findings. For these individuals (and those with idiopathic ASD), treatments target behavioral symptoms, such as the irritability and agitation experienced by this child.Our patient had a perinatal risk factor (prematurity) and a genetic risk factor (16p11.2 microdeletion). While there is a markedly increased risk for ASD in 16p11.2 microdeletion carriers, most do not receive a diagnosis of ASD. 16p11.2 deletion carriers are phenotypically diverse (and overlap with the nonclinical population), and they are at risk for several other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as obesity.8 Family members should always be offered genetic counseling and testing to assess whether they are carriers and to assess the recurrence risk of ASD in any siblings.The finding of a rare genomic variant in this patient could eventually open the door to a precision medicine treatment approach based on studies of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. As an illustration, mouse models of 16p11.2 deletion suggest that the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor agonist R-baclofen may improve behavior.6,9 R-baclofen affects inhibition by gamma-aminobutyric acid, which is postulated to contribute to the pathophysiology of ASD via excessive excitatory or insufficient inhibitory neurotransmission.

In this clinical case, the patient's gender does not appear to influence the diagnosis, treatment options, or behavioral characteristics associated with autism spectrum disorder and the specific genetic condition. The focus is primarily on the child's developmental and behavioral issues rather than any gender-specific concerns or outcomes.","B  
The child presents with significant behavioral issues, including tantrums, aggression, and self-injurious behavior, alongside developmental delays and features consistent with autism spectrum disorder. Given the severity of the irritability and self-injury, a combined approach of behavioral intervention and pharmacotherapy is warranted. Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic that has been shown to be effective in managing irritability and agitation in children with autism. While genetic testing and other pharmacotherapies may have their place, addressing the immediate behavioral concerns is crucial for the child's safety and well-being. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to refer the child to a behavioral intervention program and initiate treatment with aripiprazole.",,,,,,

Testicular cancer commonly affects males between the ages of 15 and 35 years, and is the most common solid tumor among males in this age range.1 It accounts for 1% of all cancers in men, with 95% of cases presenting as germ cell tumors.1 Cryptorchidism increases the risk of testicular cancer: in a meta-analysis,2 the pooled relative risk of testicular cancer in men with isolated cryptorchidism was 2.9. The treatment options for germ cell tumors differ between seminomatous and nonseminomatous subtypes. Seminoma is highly treatable, with cure rates exceeding 90% for all stages combined.1 The staging of testicular cancer is done in accordance with the 2017 joint staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union for International Cancer Control.3 For patients with advanced disease, prognostic tools by the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group may be used for risk stratification, prognostication, and selection of appropriate systemic therapy.4 In metastatic seminomatous germ cell tumors, patients may have a good or intermediate risk profile based on the location of the metastases. Those with an intermediate risk profile harbor metastasis to visceral organs other than the lungs or lymph nodes.This patient was diagnosed with metastatic seminoma in the good risk category. As such, the recommended treatment option is cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. The standard treatment regimen is 3 cycles of bleomycin sulfate, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP)5 or 4 cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EP).6 Trials conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Genitourinary Tract Cancer Cooperative Group5 and Groupe d’Etude des Tumeurs Uro-Genital comparing 3 cycles of BEP with 4 cycles of EP7 showed that the EP cohort had similar survival outcomes, but possibly slightly inferior, when treating individuals with a good risk profile.

Patients present with pulmonary-predominant lesions without evidence of gastrointestinal malignant neoplasm at workup.1,2 There are approximately 50 cases of PEA described in the literature that immunohistochemically compared PEA, NSCLC, and metastatic colorectal cancer.1,3 Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma shares the same immunohistochemical markers used to distinguish metastatic colorectal cancer and NSCLC, including CDX2 and CK20, which are characteristic of metastatic colorectal cancer.3,4Management can pose a dilemma for the oncologist in deciding to treat PEA as a gastrointestinal tract or lung primary malignant neoplasm, because their treatments and prognoses differ. Although the presentation of PEA is well described, few reports describe treatment response. One case report showed a partial response and progression-free survival of 4 months with adjuvant docetaxel and cisplatin therapy.5 Despite the histologic similarity of PEA to metastatic colorectal cancer, PEA may not respond well to typical colorectal chemotherapy regimens such as fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin or gemcitabine.5To reduce the risk of recurrence, the patient was treated with adjuvant docetaxel and cisplatin for 4 cycles, which was well tolerated. Six months later, he developed a new 3.9 × 3.2-cm left adrenal gland mass and nodules in the right middle lobe (0.9 × 0.7 cm) and right lower lobe (1.5 × 1.4 cm). The patient remained asymptomatic at that time. Examination of biopsy specimens of the adrenal mass showed similar morphologic characteristics and immunohistochemical profile as the prior left lower lobe malignancy.Given the progression of the patient’s condition after adjuvant chemotherapy, nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as second-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC irrespective of PD-1 staining percentage, was initiated. Stereotactic body radiotherapy was also initiated for the left adrenal mass. There is evidence that radiotherapy-associated tumor injury releases antigens that lead to a more aggressive immune response when using immune checkpoint inhibitors.6 Results of subsequent imaging 3 months later demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe nodules. The patient’s adrenal mass had decreased significantly to 1.4 × 1.0 cm.

In approximately 20% of patients, these responses can last more than 12 months, as was noted in this patient.7 However, the strength of PD-1 and PD-L1 staining correlation does not adequately estimate response. In fact, up to 19% of individuals with negative PD-1 and PD-L1 staining respond to nivolumab.7,8 The current literature suggests that that the tumor microenvironment and mutational burden are important and may explain the efficacy of treatment in the patient. Biopsy specimens demonstrating high inflammatory white cell infiltration 1 to 2 months after nivolumab therapy have been shown to be associated with excellent response.9 Mutational burden and microsatellite instability may also explain immune response.9,10 Next-generation sequencing genomic testing performed on the PEA biopsy specimen did not show microsatellite instability, although results were remarkable for intermediate mutational burden with 8 significant mutations including TP53 (OMIM 191170) and CCND1 (OMIM 168461).This patient with PEA represents a unique NSCLC phenotype that continues to have durable response of greater than 14 months with nivolumab therapy despite a low PD-1 expression.

The absence of a primary malignant neoplasm in the gastrointestinal tract, along with the specific immunohistochemical findings, supports the diagnosis of PEA rather than adenocarcinoma of unknown primary or metastatic colorectal cancer.

Gender is moderately relevant in this case as the patient is a woman in her 60s, which places her at a higher risk for certain types of cancers, including adenocarcinoma. Additionally, gender may influence treatment decisions and outcomes, particularly in the context of hormonal factors and the biological behavior of tumors.","B  
The clinical case describes a woman with a primary adenocarcinoma in the left lower lobe, characterized by a specific immunohistochemical profile (CDX2 positive, CK20 positive, TTF-1 negative, napsin A negative). This profile is consistent with pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEA), which often arises in the lungs and is associated with colorectal cancer markers. The absence of a primary malignant neoplasm in the gastrointestinal tract and the specific markers suggest that this is not metastatic colorectal cancer. Additionally, the negative PD-1 and PD-L1 testing further supports the diagnosis of PEA rather than other malignancies like lymphoma. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma.",,,,,,
728,"This pathologic specimen revealed an adenocarcinoma with immunohistochemical staining identical to that of colorectal adenocarcinoma. Positron emission tomography and upper and lower endoscopy did not reveal any evidence of colorectal malignant neoplasm or pathologic lymphadenopathy. Thus, the diagnosis of PEA was made.Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma is a histopathologic diagnosis defined as a primary non–small cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLC) with intestinal differentiation. Patients present with pulmonary-predominant lesions without evidence of gastrointestinal malignant neoplasm at workup.1,2 There are approximately 50 cases of PEA described in the literature that immunohistochemically compared PEA, NSCLC, and metastatic colorectal cancer.1,3 Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma shares the same immunohistochemical markers used to distinguish metastatic colorectal cancer and NSCLC, including CDX2 and CK20, which are characteristic of metastatic colorectal cancer.3,4Management can pose a dilemma for the oncologist in deciding to treat PEA as a gastrointestinal tract or lung primary malignant neoplasm, because their treatments and prognoses differ. Although the presentation of PEA is well described, few reports describe treatment response. One case report showed a partial response and progression-free survival of 4 months with adjuvant docetaxel and cisplatin therapy.5 Despite the histologic similarity of PEA to metastatic colorectal cancer, PEA may not respond well to typical colorectal chemotherapy regimens such as fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin or gemcitabine.5To reduce the risk of recurrence, the patient was treated with adjuvant docetaxel and cisplatin for 4 cycles, which was well tolerated. Six months later, he developed a new 3.9 × 3.2-cm left adrenal gland mass and nodules in the right middle lobe (0.9 × 0.7 cm) and right lower lobe (1.5 × 1.4 cm). The patient remained asymptomatic at that time. Examination of biopsy specimens of the adrenal mass showed similar morphologic characteristics and immunohistochemical profile as the prior left lower lobe malignancy.Given the progression of the patient’s condition after adjuvant chemotherapy, nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as second-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC irrespective of PD-1 staining percentage, was initiated. Stereotactic body radiotherapy was also initiated for the left adrenal mass. There is evidence that radiotherapy-associated tumor injury releases antigens that lead to a more aggressive immune response when using immune checkpoint inhibitors.6 Results of subsequent imaging 3 months later demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe nodules. The patient’s adrenal mass had decreased significantly to 1.4 × 1.0 cm. Since initiation of nivolumab, the patient has demonstrated greater than 14 months of durable response.Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma represents a unique manifestation of treatment-refractory NSCLC that has had a remarkable durable response with immune checkpoint inhibition. For metastatic NSCLC in particular, PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors have become a center point of discussion. In approximately 20% of patients, these responses can last more than 12 months, as was noted in this patient.7 However, the strength of PD-1 and PD-L1 staining correlation does not adequately estimate response. In fact, up to 19% of individuals with negative PD-1 and PD-L1 staining respond to nivolumab.7,8 The current literature suggests that that the tumor microenvironment and mutational burden are important and may explain the efficacy of treatment in the patient. Biopsy specimens demonstrating high inflammatory white cell infiltration 1 to 2 months after nivolumab therapy have been shown to be associated with excellent response.9 Mutational burden and microsatellite instability may also explain immune response.9,10 Next-generation sequencing genomic testing performed on the PEA biopsy specimen did not show microsatellite instability, although results were remarkable for intermediate mutational burden with 8 significant mutations including TP53 (OMIM 191170) and CCND1 (OMIM 168461).This patient with PEA represents a unique NSCLC phenotype that continues to have durable response of greater than 14 months with nivolumab therapy despite a low PD-1 expression.

Gender is somewhat relevant in this case as certain types of adenocarcinomas, including pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma, can have different prevalence rates and outcomes based on gender. Additionally, gender may influence the patient's risk factors and response to treatment, although the specific clinical details provided do not highlight any overt gender-specific issues.","B  
The patient's biopsy results show a primary adenocarcinoma with a specific immunohistochemical profile: CDX2 positive and CK20 positive, which are markers often associated with colorectal origin, but the TTF-1 and napsin A negativity suggests it is not a typical lung adenocarcinoma. The absence of a primary malignant neoplasm in the upper gastrointestinal tract and colon, along with the lobulated mass in the lung, raises suspicion for pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEA), which can mimic colorectal cancer but arises in the lung. The significant size of the tumor and the negative lymph nodes further support a diagnosis of PEA rather than metastatic disease. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis given the clinical and pathological findings is pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma.",,,,,,

Lesions subside by discontinuing the causative drug in reactive lymphomatoid reaction where TRG gene rearrangement is always negative. In adult T cell leukemia lymphoma, the antibody against human T-lymphotropic virus 1 is found in the blood. Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) subtype and is considered extranodal indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma with T-cell origin. Mycosis fungoides accounts for 54% of the CTCLs and almost 4% of cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States. Its incidence is higher in men and black patients, with the incidence rate increasing with age.1 Clinically, MF presentation mimics other dermatological conditions, making the diagnosis challenging at early stages.2 Given the difficulty of MF diagnosis, a diagnostic algorithm was developed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer to help in establishing the diagnosis. This point-based algorithm takes into account 4 aspects: clinical, histopathologic, molecular biological, and immunopathologic features. A total of 4 points is needed to establish the diagnosis of MF.3This patient’s skin lesions started as small patches and plaques, progressed to exfoliative lesions, then to nodules. Histopathologic findings were positive for upper dermal atypical lymphoid infiltrate. Molecular testing showed positive TRG gene rearrangement. Immunopathologic testing showed T cells from multiple nodular aggregates with expression of CD2, CD4, and CD5. Her stage was IIIB.The cause of MF is ill defined, though theories suggest underlying genetic predisposition with environmental triggers.4 Patients usually have similar symptoms to other inflammatory dermatological conditions such as psoriasis, chronic dermatitis, and vitiligo.4 Mycosis fungoides usually affects multiple areas simultaneously and generally affect body parts not exposed to the sun. The lesion of MF might present as patches, plaques, or tumors, which are the most common cutaneous manifestations, or generalized erythroderma. Poikiloderma is a more distinct but rare variant of MF. These lesions may increase in size and coalesce, affecting more surface areas. As in this patient, topical and/or oral steroids are effective in early-stage MF, which may confuse the diagnosis with other dermopathies, delaying diagnosis for a long time.5Diagnosis of early-stage MF is not only challenging clinically but also histopathologically. Several pathological features observed in MF can also be seen in other inflammatory diseases. Examples of those features include the following: haloed lymphocytes, Pautrier abscesses, disproportional exocytosis, and lymphocytes aligned within the basal layer. Haloed lymphocytes are considered the most suggestive of MF.6 The most substantial prognostic factors in the survival rate of MF are patient age at presentation; T, N, and B classifications; overall clinical stage; and the presence or absence of extracutaneous disease.7 The preferred method of treatment in early stage MF is skin-directed therapy, which includes topical corticosteroids, ultraviolet B, combination treatment consisting of Psoralens and then exposure of the skin to ultraviolet A, localized radiotherapy, and mechlorethamine. For more advanced stages, systemic therapy is indicated.8 This patient received multiple therapies in adjunct with radiotherapy, including bexarotene, which was discontinued because of allergic adverse effects; vorinostat, which resulted in worsening of the patient’s underlying epilepsy; and romidepsin, which resulted in resolved skin lesions (Figure 2).Clinical photograph of resolved skin lesions on the head and neck.Romidepsin is one of the histone deacetylase inhibitors that are approved for the treatment of MF, with an overall response rate of 34%.9 This case illustrates the importance of identifying indolent CTCLs, mainly MF, and offering patients new treatments if previous regimens fail. In such patients with refractory skin involvement or extracutaneous disease, enrollment in a clinical trial of novel agents is appropriate.",747_G_a_n_f,"2  
Gender is somewhat relevant in this case as certain skin conditions, including mycosis fungoides, can have different prevalence rates and presentations based on gender. Additionally, gender may influence the patient's psychosocial experience and response to treatment, which can be important in managing chronic dermatological conditions.","B  
The clinical presentation, including the gradual worsening of pruritic plaques, nodules, and the development of leonine facies, suggests a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The biopsy results showing dense band-like lymphoid infiltrate with mild epidermotropism are characteristic of mycosis fungoides, which is the most common form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The negative T cell receptor γ gene rearrangement analysis also supports this diagnosis, as mycosis fungoides can present with atypical lymphoid infiltrates that do not always show rearrangement. The patient's history of worsening skin lesions despite medication changes further aligns with the chronic nature of mycosis fungoides. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is mycosis fungoides.",,,,,,

777,"The computed tomography scan showed an intramural small-bowel hematoma with a complete bowel obstruction and no signs of perforation. Because of his persistent vomiting, the patient initially received a nasogastric tube. All oral intake immediately resulted in nausea that was relieved by nasogastric tube drainage. Because of the persistent vomiting, the patient underwent a laparotomy 2 days posttrauma, at which the diagnosis of a traumatic intramural jejunal hematoma with complete luminal obstruction was confirmed. The injured jejunal segment was resected, followed by an end-to-end anastomosis (Figure 2). The postoperative course was uncomplicated and his oral intake could be reinstated 2 days postsurgery.An isolated intramural hematoma of the small bowel is a relatively rare complication of blunt abdominal trauma in children. Clinical symptoms can range from vague and nonspecific to those fitting a complete bowel obstruction. It requires a high index of suspicion in all patients with blunt abdominal trauma, particularly because associated bowel injuries (eg, perforation) require urgent surgical treatment. In most cases, a computed tomography scan is needed for diagnosis, localization, and to estimate the severity of the obstruction. Also, computed tomography can be helpful in ruling out bowel perforations.1 Literature on the management of traumatic small-bowel hematoma is limited to case reports and small case series.2 Management can be either nonoperative or surgical, depending on the severity of obstruction, associated injuries, and complications, such as small-bowel perforation.3,4 Successful percutaneous drainage of duodenal hematomas has also been described, but evidence for this approach is scarce.5 With the duodenum largely fixed in the retroperitoneum and surgically more difficult to approach, percutaneous drainage might be a feasible strategy. In our view, percutaneous drainage of an intramural hematoma of the jejunum or ileum seems unattractive because of the risk of iatrogenic perforation and drain luxation. In this case, we chose a surgical approach because of the complete small-bowel obstruction with the outlook of long-term total parenteral feeding and the risk of secondary perforation.The patient had a complete recovery after 3-week follow-up at our outpatient clinic.",777_G_o_o_m,"0

796,"Acute mesenteric venous thrombosis has an estimated incidence of 2.7 per 100 000 population.1 Its origin is multifactorial and can be divided into acquired vs inherited conditions. Localized inflammatory processes, such as infection, trauma, pancreatitis, or tumor leading to compression or invasion into surrounding structures, may increase the risk of mesenteric venous thrombosis that affects predominantly the larger veins. If cirrhosis and solid organ neoplasms, the most common underlying causes, have been ruled out, diagnostic studies for thrombophilia and myeloproliferative disorders should performed.2 Nonoperative treatment for mesenteric venous thrombosis centers around anticoagulation along with treatment of the underlying process.3Patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis may also be diagnosed with a myeloproliferative neoplasm 8% to 18% of the time, although a previous study4 found rates as high as 40%. Among patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm and mesenteric venous thrombosis, polycythemia vera (PV) is the most common cause (27.5%), followed by essential thrombocytosis (26.2%) and primary myelofibrosis (12.8%).2 Polycythemia vera is an acquired stem cell disorder characterized by erythroid proliferation independent of erythropoietin-mediated growth factor signaling. The JAK2 (OMIM 147796) V617F mutation is found in 96% of patients with PV and is a major criterion in the World Health Organization criteria for the diagnosis of PV.5,6Arterial or venous thrombotic events are potentially devastating clinical features in patients with PV. The hypercoagulability associated with PV is mediated by increased blood viscosity and complex platelet-leukocyte interactions, manifesting in multiple vascular beds as mesenteric thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, coronary events, and cerebral vascular accidents.7Patients presenting with progressively worsening abdominal pain and distension, involuntary guarding, or peritonitis should be evaluated for ischemic bowel. With radiographic evidence of splanchnic vein thrombosis and no clinical history of malignant tumor or previous diagnosis of hypercoagulability, testing for thrombophilia markers should begin concomitantly with preparation for surgery. Care should be taken to also resect any ischemic bowel or any bowel associated with thrombosed mesentery. The extent of resection depends on the patency of mesenteric vessels that perfuse the 2 resection ends. This patency can be investigated using manual palpation of a mesenteric pulse, observing bleeding at the cut edges, intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography, or indocyanine green angiography if available. Determination of vascular patency is of paramount importance in patients who present with new-onset thromboses. An additional exploration should be planned in 24 to 36 hours if there are any doubts regarding bowel viability. A hand-sewn anastomosis should be considered for 2 segments that have discrepant luminal diameter attributable to venous congestion. Finally, an intravenous heparin infusion should begin as soon as postoperative hemostasis is determined. Transition to long-term oral anticoagulation is indicated to reduce the likelihood of recurrent thrombosis.",796_G_a_n_m,"1

The incidence of these events have been reported in up to 50% of patients, especially those requiring concurrent antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy.

Gender has minimal impact in this case, as the clinical presentation and underlying conditions (systemic lupus erythematosus, congestive heart failure, and type 2 diabetes) are not significantly influenced by the patient's gender.

The clinical presentation suggests mesenteric ischemia, particularly given the patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus, which can predispose to vascular complications. The worsening abdominal pain, disproportionate to physical findings, and the CT findings of thickened small bowel and free fluid indicate possible ischemia. The absence of abnormal laboratory findings and the rapid progression of symptoms further support this diagnosis. While lupus enteritis could be considered, the acute nature and imaging findings are more consistent with mesenteric ischemia. Therefore, mesenteric ischemia is the most appropriate diagnosis in this case.",,,,,,
811,"The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. A rheumatology consultation was obtained, and she was given intravenous methyprednisolone, 1000 mg daily, for 4 days. The patient’s abdominal pain improved within 8 hours of methyprednisolone administration, and by hospital day 2, she was tolerating a diet of solid food.Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune-mediated chronic inflammatory disease with the potential to affect every organ system.1 Systemic lupus erythematosus affects the hematologic, renal, and central nervous systems most commonly, and presentations can be variable.1 Enteritis is a relatively rare sequela of systemic lupus erythematosus, typically presenting with signs and symptoms similar to those of mesenteric ischemia, with pain out of proportion to the findings on physical examination.2 In some studies, lupus enteritis is referred to as the most frequent possible cause of abdominal pain in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus2; alternatively, in other studies, lupus enteritis is cited as a relatively rare cause of abdominal pains, illustrating our lack of knowledge about this disease secondary to its relative rarity.3 Laboratory test findings are nonspecific and usually positive only for inflammatory markers.4 Computed tomography scans demonstrate severe bowel wall thickening (ie, target sign). Mesenteric fat stranding and engorged mesenteric vessels are also commonly observed.5 Bladder wall thickening is frequently found on CT scans. The patient also presented with a moderate degree of ascites.Given the grave findings on CT scans, lupus enteritis can appear on cursory glance to resemble mesenteric ischemia but is lacking the large vessel thrombosis and/or occlusion seen in that disease.5 Prompt recognition of lupus enteritis is key to preventing the sequelae of perforation, obstruction, or necrosis.Management of lupus enteritis consists of prompt administration of immunologic suppression, usually consisting of pulse doses of corticosteroids.4 Several practitioners have reported positive outcomes using alternative methods of immunosuppression such as cyclophosphamide. These are considered second-line therapies in cases in which corticosteroids have failed or are contraindicated.4,6 Patients usually respond well to immunosuppression, as was seen in our case, with complete resolution of abdominal pain within hours.Vigilant surgical attention is warranted for early recognition of clinical deterioration. Despite the relative paucity of literature on lupus enteritis, the pendulum has shifted from early surgical intervention toward medical management in the absence of absolute indications for surgical intervention such as bowel necrosis or perforation.There have been reports of the recurrence of lupus enteritis being associated with the degree of initial bowel wall thickening or the involvement of the urinary tract.7,8 Lymphopenia, elevated amylase, and hypoalbuminemia are reported to be associated with poorer outcomes.9In conclusion, lupus enteritis, while relatively rare, is an important diagnosis to consider for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus presenting with severe abdominal pain. Given the profound findings on CT scans, it is often the consultant surgeon determining the treatment for these patients. With appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, potentially morbid diagnostic operations can be avoided.9",811_G_a_n_f,"3  
Gender is moderately relevant in this case, as systemic lupus erythematosus predominantly affects women, particularly those of childbearing age, which may influence the clinical presentation and management. Additionally, gender may impact the patient's risk factors and response to treatment, making it a significant consideration in the overall clinical situation.","A  
The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus, along with the presentation of worsening abdominal pain, diarrhea, and the findings of duodenal thickening and free fluid on CT scans, suggest lupus enteritis. This condition is a known complication of systemic lupus erythematosus, characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The absence of abnormal laboratory findings and the disproportionate pain relative to physical examination findings further support this diagnosis. Other options like mesenteric ischemia or vascular issues would typically present with more severe systemic signs or laboratory abnormalities. Therefore, lupus enteritis is the most fitting diagnosis in this clinical context.",,,,,,

The clinical presentation of right upper extremity pain, swelling, and significant impairment in motor function, along with the absence of the right radial pulse and the presence of a large heterogeneous fluid collection, suggests compartment syndrome. The history of intravenous catheter placement and subsequent symptoms indicate that the swelling and pain are likely due to infiltration of intravenous fluids into the soft tissues, leading to increased pressure within the compartment. The intact sensation and the presence of biphasic Doppler signals further support this diagnosis, as they indicate that the arterial flow is still present despite the swelling. Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention to prevent permanent damage.

The clinical presentation of the 4-year-old boy, including right lower quadrant pain, anorexia, and emesis, along with the imaging findings of an inflamed retrocecal mass, suggests Meckel diverticulitis. The absence of the appendix on ultrasound and the presence of a mass in the retrocecal area are indicative of this condition, especially in a child with a history of prematurity. Perforated appendicitis is less likely given the imaging results and the lack of secondary signs of inflammation initially. Crohn disease and ectopic ovarian torsion are also less likely based on the specific findings and age of the patient. Therefore, Meckel diverticulitis is the most appropriate diagnosis in this case.",,,,,,
839,"Computed tomography images demonstrated a retrocecal mass with surrounding inflammation. Gonadal vessels arose from this cyst-containing mass and are demonstrated in Figure 1B. These findings, along with the inability to identify the right adnexal structures on pelvic ultrasonography, are imaging characteristics that are suggestive of a torsed ectopic ovary. We proceeded with a diagnostic laparoscopy. On initial exploration, we identified a unicornuate uterus with normal-appearing left adnexa and absent right adnexal structures. A normal-appearing appendix was noted and retrocecal mobilization identified a necrotic right ovary and fallopian tube adherent to the retroperitoneum within the right paracolic gutter (Figure 2).Intraoperative image demonstrating exposure of a torsed ectopic right ovary (RO) and fallopian tube (RF) during mobilization of the cecum (Cec). Relationship to the iliac vessels (IV) is highlighted.Ectopic or undescended ovaries are defined by their location outside of the true pelvis.1 During normal development, ovaries form from the urogenital ridge on the posterior aspect of the peritoneal cavity during the fifth week of gestation. Ovarian descent to the true pelvis is mediated by chemotactic factors and the gubernaculum. The etiology of ovarian maldescent is unknown but is posited to arise from a lack of migration or growth restriction of the urogenital ridge. Given their shared embryonic origin, ovarian maldescent is associated with renal anomalies in approximately 20% of cases.2The prevalence of ectopic ovaries is estimated as less than 1%.1 The incidence of ovarian maldescent is increased among women with an unicornuate uterus (approximately 40%) and mullerian agenesis (approximately 20%).2 Ovarian maldescent is associated with infertility, as a recent review demonstrated that 77% of cases were identified during infertility evaluations.2 Notably, there is an increased risk of experiencing an ectopic pregnancy (4%).3 The formation of cysts and tumors have been documented in case reports.4 Ectopic ovaries have also been associated with recurrent, cyclic abdominal pain that accompanies menstruation.5Ectopic ovarian torsion has not been previously described. Ovarian torsion is a relatively common cause of abdominal pain, accounting for 2.7% of all cases among women younger than 20 years.6 Torsion may occur at any age but is most common among women of reproductive age. Ovarian torsion presents a surgical emergency that requires emergent detorsion. Historically, an oophorectomy has been performed when a torsed ovary does not appear viable, but recent evidence supports ovarian preservation to optimize fertility potential.6 Specifically, follicular development has been demonstrated by follow-up ultrasonography among more than 90% of women with necrotic-appearing ovaries at the time of initial exploration.7,8 Despite this information, many clinicians continue to perform oophorectomies in patients who present with torsion and have a necrotic-appearing ovary.9Ectopic ovaries are associated with infertility and recurrent abdominal pain. This patient was premenarchal with a necrotic but otherwise normal-appearing ovary lacking any appreciable cause for her acute adnexal torsion. We elected to proceed with a salpingo-oophorectomy in this setting given the lack of any communication with the uterus, the normal appearance of the left adnexa, and the association between ectopic ovaries with infertility, ectopic pregnancy, pain with menstruation, and a potential risk of recurrent torsion. This patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on her first postoperative day. A pathologic review demonstrated ovarian and fallopian tube tissue with evidence of extensive hemorrhagic necrosis and no evidence of cysts or tumors.",839_G_a_n_f,"2  
The patient's gender is somewhat relevant in this case, as it influences the differential diagnosis, particularly regarding conditions like ectopic ovarian torsion, which is specific to females. Additionally, gender may affect the presentation and management of certain abdominal conditions, but it is not the primary factor in this clinical scenario.","B  
The clinical presentation of the child, including the right lower quadrant pain, anorexia, and the imaging findings of an inflamed retrocecal mass, suggests Meckel diverticulitis. The absence of the appendix on imaging and the child's age, along with the history of prematurity, further support this diagnosis. Perforated appendicitis is less likely given the imaging results and the lack of significant systemic signs of infection. Crohn disease typically presents with more chronic symptoms and would likely show other signs of bowel involvement. Ectopic ovarian torsion is unlikely due to the imaging findings and the child's gender.",,,,,,

Other patients may present with abdominal pain, abdominal mass, weight loss, or acute appendicitis.4 The presence of symptoms is associated with a higher incidence of cystadenocarcinoma.The diagnosis is usually confirmed with a CT scan, which characteristically shows a well-encapsulated cystic mass that is usually in the right lower quadrant. Curvilinear mural calcification is seen in 50% of cases.5 Cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas are typically larger and are associated with a 20% incidence of perforation. Perforation is indicated by the presence of ascites in the pelvis and the right upper quadrant.When a mucocele perforates, it releases mucoid material into the peritoneal cavity. This material may be acellular or may contain dysplastic cells. Patients with a spillage of mucus into the peritoneal cavity containing epithelial cells have a different prognosis than those with intact mucoceles, and a specimen of the fluid should be sent for analysis.5 In cases with epithelial cell contamination, patients may progress to developing pseudomyxoma peritonei, peritoneal carcinomatosis, or peritoneal tumors, which is why it is important to keep mucoceles intact during excisions. Peritoneal carcinomatosis may be treated with a combination of cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and patients should be referred to a peritoneal carcinomatosis treatment center for this definitive treatment.6 If a large mucocele is found during laparoscopy, conversion to laparotomy is safer, as it allows the specimen to be removed without rupturing and also allows for an exploration for mucoid fluid.7Excising a mucocele does not have to extend to the right hemicolectomy, unless there is an involvement of the appendiceal or ileocolic lymph nodes, although this is unusual.

Patients with a spillage of mucus into the peritoneal cavity containing epithelial cells have a different prognosis than those with intact mucoceles, and a specimen of the fluid should be sent for analysis.5 In cases with epithelial cell contamination, patients may progress to developing pseudomyxoma peritonei, peritoneal carcinomatosis, or peritoneal tumors, which is why it is important to keep mucoceles intact during excisions. Peritoneal carcinomatosis may be treated with a combination of cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and patients should be referred to a peritoneal carcinomatosis treatment center for this definitive treatment.6 If a large mucocele is found during laparoscopy, conversion to laparotomy is safer, as it allows the specimen to be removed without rupturing and also allows for an exploration for mucoid fluid.7Excising a mucocele does not have to extend to the right hemicolectomy, unless there is an involvement of the appendiceal or ileocolic lymph nodes, although this is unusual. If a frozen section of the appendix shows a spread of tumor cells longitudinally, this would also require a right hemicolectomy to allow for an adequate removal.8The patient underwent a laparotomy during which a huge cystic lesion occupying much of the right side of the abdomen was found (Figure 2). Medial and lateral adhesions were divided to mobilize the mass. A limited right hemicolectomy was performed to remove the bowel and lesion en masse. The histology of the specimen confirmed a mucinous cystadenoma originating from the appendix. Following the operation, she made an uneventful recovery, required no further treatment, and is doing well.At laparotomy, a large cystic mass (black arrowhead) was found arising from the cecum (white arrowhead). After mobilizing the right colon, a limited right hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis was performed and the tumor was removed en masse.",869_G_a_n_f,"1

The clinical presentation of a large mobile mass in the right iliac fossa, along with the findings from the colonoscopy indicating external compression at the cecum, suggests a cystic mass related to the appendix. A mucocele of the appendix is characterized by the accumulation of mucus within the appendiceal lumen, which can present as a palpable mass and may not show intraluminal abnormalities on colonoscopy. The absence of rectal bleeding and normal bowel habits further supports a diagnosis that is not acute or inflammatory, such as an abscess or malignancy. Given the age of the patient and the nature of the mass, a mucocele is a plausible diagnosis. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is a mucocele of the appendix.",,,,,,

Other causes include stenosis or obstruction at the gastrojejunostomy site from ulceration, radiation enteritis, tumor recurrence, bezoars, or foreign bodies.2 In a retrospective study of 186 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer, afferent loop syndrome was found in approximately 13% of long-term survivors (>2 years after surgery).3 The most common clinical signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. Interestingly, this study found that 2-year survival was the only independent predictor for the development of afferent limb syndrome after controlling for other factors such as age, sex, type of surgery, and adjuvant chemoradiation. Malignant obstruction from cancer recurrence was seen in 33% of the patients, while radiation enteropathy was found to be the cause in 38%.Patients with a surgical history of gastric bypass who present with pancreaticobiliary problems, such as obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, or pancreatitis, should be evaluated for afferent loop syndrome.

The estimated incidence of herpetic whitlow is about 2.5 per 100 000 patients per year, which is probably mistaken.1 It mainly affects children younger than 10 years (HSV-1) or young adults (HSV-1 or HSV-2).2-4 Health care workers are at higher risk of contamination, especially when they are in contact with the oral cavity or secretions from the nasopharynx and mouth, ie, dentists, anesthesiologists, and medical staff working in intensive care units.5The literature reports several cases of complications resulting from misdiagnosed herpetic whitlows treated with surgery, ie, incision and drainage that may lead to secondary bacterial infection.2,6,7 Systemic and/or local complications, such as herpetic keratitis, hypoesthesia or hyperesthesia, and nail loss, are described. Misdiagnosis leading to unnecessary surgery and potential increasing morbidity highlights the importance of diagnosing a herpetic whitlow without wasting time in medical workers. Some characteristic clinical signs may be helpful: (1) occurrence after trauma in the skin defect area, usually in the dominant hand; (2) prodromal pain that appears between 2 and 20 days after inoculation; (3) occasional presence of fever and systemic symptoms; and (4) typical appearance  of a large vesicle with serous fluid surrounded by erythema; grouped or scattered vesicles can be also observed. The diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction or viral cultures.After resolution of the initial infection, the virus can be reactivated spontaneously or triggered by an appropriate stimulus, eg, a general illness, stress, ultraviolet light exposure, menstruation, or tissue damage. About 20% to 50% of patients experience a recurrence that remains usually milder than the primary infection.1 Herpetic whitlow requires an appropriate treatment with oral antiviral medication. Acyclovir or valacyclovir may be beneficial in this context to prevent recurrence and reduce duration of symptoms.8 The other aim of treatment is to prevent autoinoculation and transmission of the infection, with local protection with wound dressing.9This case emphasized that herpetic whitlow may occur in any health care worker who has regular contact with contaminated oral secretion. Recurrence is the rule, and it may represent an occupational disease. For surgeons, there remains the question of the right to operate in initial infection and recurrence and patient information. No recommendation exists in Europe.In 2004, the Department of Health of Western Australia published Guidelines for Health Care Workers with Herpes Lesions (http://www.health.wa.gov.au/circularsnew/pdfs/7417.pdf): (1) any health care worker with direct patient contact and who has a suspected HSV lesion of the hands should report to the designated Staff Health Officer; (2) a HSV lesion should be considered infectious until the lesion has become crusty and dry; and (3) the risk of transmission from an active herpetic whitlow to a patient, especially a newborn, is higher. There should be no direct patient contact until the lesions have healed.In conclusion, this case highlighted that herpetic whitlow may affect health care workers. Moreover, it is often misdiagnosed as bacterial infection. Knowledge of clinical symptoms would avoid inappropriate surgical treatment, especially in recurrent lesions. No direct patient contact until lesions have healed could be recommended for surgeons.",890_G_a_m_n,"2  
Gender is somewhat relevant in this case as it may influence the likelihood of certain infections, such as herpetic whitlow, which can be more common in females due to anatomical and hormonal factors. Additionally, understanding gender-specific health behaviors and risks could inform medical decisions and patient education regarding prevention and management.","B  
The clinical presentation of prodromal burning pain followed by the development of a painful vesicle suggests a recurrent herpetic whitlow. This condition is characterized by herpetic lesions on the fingers, often triggered by previous exposure to the herpes simplex virus. The recurrence at the same site, along with the vesicular formation, aligns with the typical symptoms of herpetic infections. The history of the initial injury and subsequent abscess does not support a diagnosis of osteitis, foreign body reaction, or bacterial cellulitis, as these would not typically present with vesicular lesions. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is a recurrent herpetic whitlow.",,,,,,

The mass showed apparent bony tissue.Metastases to the thyroid gland are reported at autopsy in 1% to 24% of metastatic cancer patients.1,2 The most common sites were kidney, lung, breast, esophagus, and uterus.3-5 Some studies showed that the most common primary tumor for thyroid metastases was lung cancer4,6,7; however, some showed renal cell carcinoma.3,8 Review articles concluded that lung and renal cell carcinomas made up more than 80% of total thyroid gland metastases. Unlike uterine cancer, cancer of the cervix is not a common primary source for thyroid metastasis. Unlike the considerable predominance of primary thyroid cancers in women, some studies have found male,1 some have found female,3 and some studies have found no gender predominance4,5 for metastasis to the thyroid gland.The majority of patients presented with clinical complaints, such as new-onset neck swelling, dysphagia, dysphonia, and cough.8 Clinical differential diagnosis for a rapidly enlarging unilateral thyroid mass includes anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), thyroid lymphoma or sarcoma, metastasis to the thyroid gland, and abscess. Differential diagnosis for pathology should include osteosarcoma, sarcomatoid PDTC, ATC with osseous metaplasia, medullary thyroid carcinoma, spindle epithelial tumor with thymus-like differentiation, and synovial sarcoma.9 The cytological image may be ambiguous and requires histopathological confirmation, supported by immunohistochemical examinations.Sarcomas are derived from mesenchymal cells, such as bone, fat, and muscle. Sarcomas of the thyroid, both primary and metastatic, are rare. Osteosarcomas express vimentin; leiomyosarcomas express vimentin, desmin, and smooth-muscle actin. Unlike PDTC, ATC often displays p53 mutations and does not stain for thyroglobulin and often not vimentin. Osteosarcoma may be positive for p53.Metastases of primary tumors can be divided into 2 categories: synchronous and metachronous. Synchronous indicates that the tumors are detected at the same time as the thyroid metastases, whereas metachronous indicates that the thyroid metastases are detected some time after the primary tumor was detected. The mean interval between discovery of the primary tumor and the thyroid metastases was 5.8 years.8 Our patient presented with thyroid gland metastasis after 4 years of disease-free survival without other metastasis apparent on PET-CT examination.We recommend neck ultrasonography for all thyroid enlargement as a first step for imaging. However, in selected cases, CT or PET-CT may be considered initially if clinical suspicion is high for nonthyroid causes such as metastases.In patients with clinically suspected metastasis to the thyroid gland, core-needle biopsy achieved a significantly higher sensitivity than fine-needle biopsy without any false-negative results.10 In cases of known rare primary malignant abnormality, nontypical ultrasonography features of primary thyroid malignant abnormality, and need for an additional immunohistochemical analysis, core-needle biopsy may be primarily considered.10 In this case, we deferred biopsy considering highly calcified tissue on CT imaging and likelihood of osteosarcoma metastasis with previous history of osteosarcoma.The treatment is surgical excision of the lesion with or without lymph node dissection. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy is also considered in selected cases of local recurrence or concomitant metastases. Surgical treatment was associated with improved survival duration.3 The incidence of surgical complications was very low and did not vary by extent of surgical treatment. The most common surgical complications are injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and incomplete resection of the metastasis. In 1 review,5 no patients had tumor recurrence when margins were negative. In light of these data, subtotal thyroidectomy may be warranted unless there is concern for involvement of the contralateral lobe. However, another review3 found that recurrence was more likely in patients treated with subtotal thyroidectomies (13.3%) vs total thyroidectomies (4.8%).Metastasis of osteosarcoma to the thyroid gland is rare. It is important to consider thyroid metastases in the differential diagnosis in thyroid nodules, especially in patients with a medical history of malignant abnormality and rapidly enlarging thyroid mass. Immunohistochemistry is important to establish a diagnosis.",919_G_o_o_f,"3  
Gender is moderately relevant in this case as the patient is a woman with a recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, which is more common in females and may influence her overall treatment plan and prognosis.

The clinical case presents a woman with a history of high-grade osteosarcoma and recent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, along with a calcified left thyroid lobe mass. The immunohistochemical profile of the neoplastic cells shows positivity for vimentin and smooth muscle actin, which are more consistent with sarcomatous features rather than thyroid-specific markers. Given her history of osteosarcoma, the calcified mass in the thyroid is likely a metastasis from the previously treated osteosarcoma. The absence of thyroid-specific markers and the presence of a calcified mass further support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is osteosarcoma metastasis.",,,,,,

Differential diagnosis for pathology should include osteosarcoma, sarcomatoid PDTC, ATC with osseous metaplasia, medullary thyroid carcinoma, spindle epithelial tumor with thymus-like differentiation, and synovial sarcoma.9 The cytological image may be ambiguous and requires histopathological confirmation, supported by immunohistochemical examinations.Sarcomas are derived from mesenchymal cells, such as bone, fat, and muscle.

Unlike PDTC, ATC often displays p53 mutations and does not stain for thyroglobulin and often not vimentin. Osteosarcoma may be positive for p53.Metastases of primary tumors can be divided into 2 categories: synchronous and metachronous. Synchronous indicates that the tumors are detected at the same time as the thyroid metastases, whereas metachronous indicates that the thyroid metastases are detected some time after the primary tumor was detected.

939,"Magnetic resonance images at 8 weeks after initiating ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy demonstrate an enlarged ovoid-shaped pituitary gland and thickening of the infundibulum. Based both on the constellation of imaging, laboratory, and clinical findings and the known association of hypophysitis during immune-checkpoint inhibitor treatment, the diagnosis of immune-related hypophysitis was made in this patient treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab. The laboratory abnormalities associated with hypophysitis can include low or inappropriately normal levels of TSH, low levels of ACTH, thyroid hormones, or gonadal hormones. Disruptions of the pituitary can lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, or hypogonadism. Hypophysitis is one of the many adverse effects that has been related to immunotherapies; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, aseptic meningitis, and other neurologic adverse effects have also been reported.1The patient was started on steroid therapy with 20/10-mg doses (am/pm replacement dose) of hydrocortisone. The treatment of hypophysitis was complicated when at 3 days following her last cycle of ipilimumab and nivolumab she was admitted to the hospital for colitis. She was hospitalized for 3 weeks and treated with Solu-Medrol and infliximab. She was discharged receiving a high-dose of prednisone and later tapered to a maintenance dose of hydrocortisone. In total, she completed 4 cycles of ipilimumab and nivolumab.The patient’s clinical symptoms resolved, including headache and fatigue. A follow-up MRI demonstrated resolution of the pituitary enlargement (Figure). She continues to be monitored for adrenal insufficiency and thyroid abnormalities, and more than a year after initiation of treatment her adrenocorticotropic hormone level was 5 pg/mL (reference range, 10-60 pg/mL) and morning cortisol level was 12.9 μg/dL (reference range, 6-14 μg/dL).Mechanistically, ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against programed cell death protein-1 (PD-1). CTLA-4 and PD-1 normally function as immune checkpoints by downregulating pathways involved in T lymphocyte activation. By binding CTLA-4 and PD-1, ipilimumab and nivolumab increase the activation of the immune system by inactivating these immune checkpoints. Immune-checkpoint inhibition has been associated with a unique set of adverse events termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that can involve multiple organ systems in the body.2,3 Immune-related hypophysitis during immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy is an uncommon but increasingly recognized form of irAE. Various studies examining patients treated with monotherapy ipilimumab have reported an incidence of immune-related hypophysitis ranging from 1% to 13%.4-8 The median time of onset for hypophysitis after beginning ipilimumab was found to be 9 weeks (range, 5-36 weeks).7 In a study analyzing nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy, 11.7% of patients developed hypophysitis.9The treatment of ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis is often with systemic high-dose corticosteroids, although the supportive-treatment with hormone replacement for hypophysitis-related hormone deficiencies could also be considered as a treatment strategy. It was noted that frequency of hypophysitis resolution and time to resolution did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment strategies, nor did either group recover from persistent adrenal insufficiency.7This case highlights the clinical and radiographic presentation of immune-related hypophysitis during ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy for metastatic melanoma. As the use of immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapies rapidly increases in clinical oncology practice, heightened awareness of and familiarity with the manifestations of various forms of irAEs, including hypophysitis, will be important for clinicians involved in immuno-oncology patient care.",939_G_o_o_f,"3

The patient's symptoms of daily headaches, low energy levels, and difficulty reading, combined with the context of receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab, suggest a possible immune-related adverse effect. The gradual decrease in TSH levels and the low total triiodothyronine level indicate potential thyroid dysfunction, which can be associated with immune-related hypophysitis. Additionally, the absence of visual field defects and the nature of her headaches further support this diagnosis over others like brain metastasis or a pituitary adenoma. The timing of her symptoms following immunotherapy aligns with the known side effects of these treatments, particularly affecting the pituitary gland.

Based both on the constellation of imaging, laboratory, and clinical findings and the known association of hypophysitis during immune-checkpoint inhibitor treatment, the diagnosis of immune-related hypophysitis was made in this patient treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab. The laboratory abnormalities associated with hypophysitis can include low or inappropriately normal levels of TSH, low levels of ACTH, thyroid hormones, or gonadal hormones. Disruptions of the pituitary can lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, or hypogonadism. Hypophysitis is one of the many adverse effects that has been related to immunotherapies; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, aseptic meningitis, and other neurologic adverse effects have also been reported.1The patient was started on steroid therapy with 20/10-mg doses (am/pm replacement dose) of hydrocortisone. The treatment of hypophysitis was complicated when at 3 days following her last cycle of ipilimumab and nivolumab she was admitted to the hospital for colitis. She was hospitalized for 3 weeks and treated with Solu-Medrol and infliximab. She was discharged receiving a high-dose of prednisone and later tapered to a maintenance dose of hydrocortisone. In total, she completed 4 cycles of ipilimumab and nivolumab.The patient’s clinical symptoms resolved, including headache and fatigue. A follow-up MRI demonstrated resolution of the pituitary enlargement (Figure). She continues to be monitored for adrenal insufficiency and thyroid abnormalities, and more than a year after initiation of treatment her adrenocorticotropic hormone level was 5 pg/mL (reference range, 10-60 pg/mL) and morning cortisol level was 12.9 μg/dL (reference range, 6-14 μg/dL).Mechanistically, ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against programed cell death protein-1 (PD-1). CTLA-4 and PD-1 normally function as immune checkpoints by downregulating pathways involved in T lymphocyte activation. By binding CTLA-4 and PD-1, ipilimumab and nivolumab increase the activation of the immune system by inactivating these immune checkpoints. Immune-checkpoint inhibition has been associated with a unique set of adverse events termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that can involve multiple organ systems in the body.2,3 Immune-related hypophysitis during immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy is an uncommon but increasingly recognized form of irAE. Various studies examining patients treated with monotherapy ipilimumab have reported an incidence of immune-related hypophysitis ranging from 1% to 13%.4-8 The median time of onset for hypophysitis after beginning ipilimumab was found to be 9 weeks (range, 5-36 weeks).7 In a study analyzing nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy, 11.7% of patients developed hypophysitis.9The treatment of ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis is often with systemic high-dose corticosteroids, although the supportive-treatment with hormone replacement for hypophysitis-related hormone deficiencies could also be considered as a treatment strategy. It was noted that frequency of hypophysitis resolution and time to resolution did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment strategies, nor did either group recover from persistent adrenal insufficiency.7This case highlights the clinical and radiographic presentation of immune-related hypophysitis during ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy for metastatic melanoma. As the use of immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapies rapidly increases in clinical oncology practice, heightened awareness of and familiarity with the manifestations of various forms of irAEs, including hypophysitis, will be important for clinicians involved in immuno-oncology patient care.",939_G_a_m_f,"2

The clinical presentation of daily headaches, low energy levels, and difficulty reading, combined with the patient's treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab, suggests a possible immune-related adverse effect. The gradual decrease in TSH levels and the low total triiodothyronine level indicate potential thyroid dysfunction, which can be associated with immune-related hypophysitis.

Given multifocal disease, a lumbar puncture procedure was conducted, with cerebrospinal fluid showing rare lymphocytes. Flow cytometry demonstrated an unusual population of B cells which were κ restricted, positive for CD19 and D20, and negative for CD5 and CD10. The extracranial mass resolved with the patient receiving dexamethasone 4 mg 3 times a day, as did her weakness and confusion. She received brain and sacral radiation (10 fractions, 20 Gy) and is currently asymptomatic and awaiting follow-up imaging and lumbar puncture.Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas are the third most common histologic subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphomas.1 They most frequently arise in the stomach; however, involvement of nongastrointestinal sites has been described.1 In a multicenter retrospective survey of 180 extragastric MALT lymphomas, none of the patients presented with dural involvement.1 Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the dura has been described in case reports as an indolent disease, typically presenting with isolated and well-defined meningeal involvement that mimics meningioma on imaging.2-5 Most of these cases occurred in women, and developed gradually with symptoms including headaches, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, seizures, and focal neurological deficits.6 To our knowledge, this is the first report of such aggressive presentation of dural MALT lymphoma in the literature.2-5,7-9 This case is unusual not only as an example of this rare site of MALT lymphoma involvement, but also in the uniquely aggressive tumor growth. The expansion of this patient’s tumor from unnoticeable to 8-cm diameter in less than 3 weeks is remarkable, as is the dramatic reversal in response to dexamethasone.Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma arises from either physiologic lymphoid tissue (ie, Peyer patches in the gut) or from acquired MALT that develops in response to infection or autoimmune disease (ie, Hashimoto thyroiditis or Sjogren syndrome).1 Although the central nervous system (CNS) lacks mucosa, MALT lymphoma is thought to arise from meningothelial cells.5 Under these inflammatory conditions a pathologic clone may overtake the normal population, giving rise to malignant lymphocytes that express general B-cell markers (CD19, CD20, CD79a), some complement receptors (CD21, CD35), but are negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD23, and cyclin D1 expression.2In general, MALT lymphomas carry a positive prognosis, with an estimated 5-year survival of 90% for extragastric MALT lymphomas.1 However, CNS involvement occurs so rarely that survival in this subtype has not been determined.2 Short-term follow-up of reported cases involving the dura demonstrates potential for complete remission following surgery and adjuvant therapy, suggesting a similarly positive outlook.2 The ideal treatment regimen for MALT lymphoma has not been determined, and typically involves a patient-specific combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. In general MALT lymphomas tend to be radiosensitive, responding well to low-dose radiation therapy.6 For this reason, there is a general preference for radiotherapy over chemotherapy in the treatment of localized MALT lymphoma. Data from a case series of patients with dural MALT lymphoma treated with radiation therapy suggests that MALT lymphoma of the dura is no different in this regard and the authors recommend low-dose and limited-field radiation therapy for focal, localized dural MALT lymphoma.10This case illustrates the importance of including low-grade MALT lymphoma in the differential for a rapidly enlarging scalp mass. The multifocal and aggressive presentation of this patient’s disease emphasizes the importance of systemic workup in what has previously been described as an indolent tumor.",978_G_o_o_f,"2

999,"Results of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration were consistent with the neutrophil-rich variant of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) that was negative for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Samples from the left upper neck lymph node and mandible mass demonstrated a population of large atypical cells in a background of abundant neutrophils. The atypical cells were positive for CD30 (strong, uniform), CD4, TIA1, EMA (variable), and CD7 (dim, partial) and very rare atypical cells showed dim expression of CD5. The cells were negative for ALK, CD3, CD8, Pax-5, CD15, CD79a, CD20, CD138, S100, and pan-keratin. The Ki-67 proliferation index was high. Results of bone marrow biopsy showed involvement with CD30-positive ALCL.Following discussion among the surgeon, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and support staff in the multidisciplinary tumor conference, nonsurgical management was pursued. Chemoradiotherapy was begun using CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), with plans for subsequent consolidation radiotherapy. The patient is currently undergoing treatment, with initial response to chemotherapy.Lymphomas represent the second most common malignant tumor of the head and neck.1 Although they present most commonly in the cervical lymph nodes, extranodal involvement is not uncommon. In a case series of 235 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the head and neck, 23% presented with extranodal involvement of the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, or larynx.1 However, none of these patients presented with bony involvement, highlighting the rare nature of our case. To our knowledge, we report the first case of neutrophil-rich, ALK-negative ALCL involving the mandible as the systemic extranodal presentation. This report also represents the first case of neutrophil-rich ALCL to present with stage IV systemic extranodal spread in an immune-competent patient.Anaplastic large cell lymphoma represents a subset of lymphomas that are defined by the malignant proliferation of large lymphoid cells with strong CD30 expression.2 First described by Stein et al3 in 1985, ALCL has been further divided into 3 main entities: primary systemic ALK-positive ALCL, primary systemic ALK-negative ALCL, and primary cutaneous ALCL.2 The rare neutrophil-rich histologic variant of ALCL that we report here was first identified by Mann et al4 in 1995, and has since been observed in both ALK-positive and ALK-negative subtypes.5,6Among 6 patients initially described with neutrophil-rich ALCL, Mann et al4 noted that the abundance of neutrophils on pathologic findings appeared to correlate with extranodal involvement of the muscle, skin, and lung. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions from such a small number of patients, the abundance of neutrophils on our patient’s pathologic findings, combined with the aggressive extranodal character of her disease, appears to support this trend.The aggressive nature of our patient’s disease also may be attributed to the lack of ALK expression. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase–negative ALCL tends to affect older patients and is characterized by a poor prognosis.2,7 Expression of ALK is caused by chromosomal translocations, including the most common translocation, t(2;5).2 Analysis of patients with the T-cell and null phenotype of ALCL showed a drastic difference in 5-year survival, at 93% for patients with ALK-positive ALCL and 37% for those with ALK-negative ALCL.7 However, the subset of patients with ALK-negative ALCL who also possess a DUSP22 (OMIM 616778) rearrangement have a favorable prognosis, similar to that of patients with ALK-positive disease.8 In addition to expanding our knowledge of a rare subtype of ALCL, this case highlights the aggressive nature of ALK-negative ALCL and the importance of including lymphomas in the differential diagnosis for a bone or soft-tissue mass of the head and neck.",999_G_o_o_f,"3

1016,"A superficial shave biopsy was performed and the results were initially interpreted as well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (Figure, A). Deeper excisional biopsies were performed of the originally biopsied lesion and representative smaller papulonodules. These biopsy specimens demonstrated the classic histopathologic changes seen in hypertrophic lichen planus (HLP) (Figure, B). Hypertrophic lichen planus is a subtype of lichen planus, a common skin eruption characterized histologically by a bandlike (lichenoid) lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis and destruction of the basal layer of the epidermis (Figure, C).After 6 weeks of clobetasol propionate, 0.05%, a high-potency topical corticosteroid, applied under occlusion, near-complete resolution was noted.Antibodies that target the programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) are gaining acceptance in oncology for a variety of neoplasms. Activated T cells express PD-1 as an immune checkpoint receptor to mediate immunosuppression and immune tolerance. Tumor and stromal cells express immunosuppressive PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Thus, inhibition of PD-1 and its immunosuppressive ligands increase antitumor T-cell response and disinhibit T-cell tolerance.1 This has emerged as a therapeutic strategy in oncology, and 3 antibody inhibitors have gained US Food and Drug Administration approval since 2014: pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab. Pembrolizumab is approved for melanoma and non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while nivolumab is approved for squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC, renal cancer, melanoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma; atezolizumab is approved for bladder cancer.Checkpoint inhibition can induce autoimmune responses. Clinical observation of toxic effects from immune checkpoint inhibitors has led to the identification of immune-related adverse events, including dermatologic, hepatic, and gastrointestinal toxic effects. In agents targeting PD-1, a significant percentage of such adverse events appear in the skin,2-6 termed immune-related cutaneous adverse events.5 Lichenoid tissue reactions, eczema, and vitiligo appear to be the most common immune-related cutaneous adverse events with pembrolizumab, with lichenoid reactions observed in 17% of patients in a recent single institution cohort.5 While this patient’s skin reaction developed relatively early on in her treatment course, these events typically occur later in therapy. These immune-related cutaneous adverse events do not seem to be confined to pembrolizumab and are likely a class effect.The protypical lichenoid tissue reaction is lichen planus, a pruritic eruption found in the skin and mucous membranes.7 Clinical findings are polymorphic and range from classic flat-topped polygonal purple papules to bullous, erosive, and hypertrophic variants.

Most of the LC cases are described in patients with AML; however, it can also develop in myelodysplastic syndrome, accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.4The common sites of extramedullary AML are skin, bone, periosteum, soft tissue, and lymph nodes.5 Other commonly reported sites are those with less rigorous immune surveillance including testes, ovaries, and the central nervous system.5 Therefore, patients may present with soft tissue masses or lymphadenopathy and life-threatening complications such as spinal cord compression and extremity paresis.5 Cutaneous manifestations in LC are characterized by infiltration of leukemic cells into epidermis or dermis, causing single-to-multiple erythematous nodular or papular lesions that may be accompanied by ecchymosis, palpable purpura, bullous lesions, erythroderma, or ulcers. Most patients who received allogeneic SCT require post-SCT immunosuppressive agents to prevent graft-vs-host disease. Therefore, differential diagnoses of new skin lesions associated with recurrent fever are broad—including bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, and disease relapse—rendering LC a diagnostic challenge, especially when the marrow exam is negative.Risk factors associated with extramedullary relapse include French-American-British AML subtypes M4/M5 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.5; P = .02), age 18 years or younger (HR, 3.3; P = .006), pre-SCT extramedullary leukemia (HR, 4.6; P < .001), and refractory disease at the time of SCT (HR, 2.6; P = .02)1.

The pathogenesis of extramedullary infiltration is ill-defined. Extramedullary migration is presumably initiated by altered expression of adhesion molecule that allows for the separation of leukemic cells from the bone marrow and mobilization into blood circulation.6 In a prior study7 of 331 patients with de novo AML, the CD56 positivity (defined as at least 20% of blasts expressing CD56 on flow-cytometry) was shown to be associated with significantly higher rate of extramedullary disease compared to CD56 negativity (53.1% vs 29.2%; P = .01), suggesting that CD56 may mediate extramedullary migration or tissue invasion. However, there was no significant intergroup difference in leukemic skin infiltration (3.1% vs 3.1%; P > .99), questioning the role of CD56 in LC pathogenesis7.Two-years overall survival rate in patients with extramedullary relapse was shown to be 11% to 38%, and the prognosis depends on the presence of concurrent medullary disease.

Since graft-vs-leukemia effect plays an important role for cutaneous disease control, tapering immunosuppressive agents should be considered as an initial approach in patients without active graft-vs-host disease.6 In patients with good performance status and younger age, systemic chemotherapy could be a reasonable option as a next step. Previous retrospective study in 257 patients with AML and post-SCT extramedullary relapse showed nominally longer median survival with systemic chemotherapy compared with no treatment (120 vs 25 days)1. Adding donor lymphocyte infusion into the systemic chemotherapy resulted in further improvement in median survival (226 vs 120 days).1 Therefore, donor lymphocyte infusion  should be strongly considered if it is available. In patients who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy, DNA hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine could be an alternative option as shown in a recent case study.9 Hypomethylating agents induce leukemic cell differentiation as well as increase the expression of the human leukocyte antigen and tumor-associated antigens, which may potentiate the graft-vs-leukemia effect.10 In our patient, cyclosporine was tapered and azacitidine (75 mg/m2/d for 7 days) was started based on his poor performance status.

They tend to hang down either side of the pericardium, molding to the mediastinal structures.3 However, due to the predominant fat density, thymolipomas are difficult to diagnose on plain film. Chest tomography is the investigative procedure of choice; the pathognomonic finding is the predominant fat attenuation mixed with nodular elements that represent thymic tissue. Thymolipomas are distinct from thymomas, which do not have fatty elements, and mediastinal lipomatosis, which does not have these nodular elements. Thymolipomas are never associated with elevated tumor markers, including β-human chorionic gonadotropin, α-fetoprotein, or lactate dehydrogenase, differentiating them from germ cell tumors. Thymolipomas tumors can be mistaken for myelolipomas, which are very rare. On gross morphologic examination, thymic nests in thymolipomas are salmon-colored and dispersed throughout the predominantly fatty tumor (Figure 2). Histologic analysis of thymolipomas shows mature fat and thymic tissue with lack of Hassall corpuscles and intervening areas of fibrosis. In contrast, myelolipomas reveal hallmark bone marrow elements on histologic examination.4 Thymolipomas have been proposed to develop due to regression of a hyperplastic thymus, lipoma formation within thymic tissue, or hamartoma formation in the thymus.5Gross analysis. Cut section reveals a predominantly fatty tumor with islands of salmon-colored nests representing thymic tissue (black asterisks).This patient presented with presyncope and dyspnea likely resulting from caval compression.

Timely surgical excision of thymolipomas is the treatment of choice and results are excellent.

They tend to hang down either side of the pericardium, molding to the mediastinal structures.3 However, due to the predominant fat density, thymolipomas are difficult to diagnose on plain film. Chest tomography is the investigative procedure of choice; the pathognomonic finding is the predominant fat attenuation mixed with nodular elements that represent thymic tissue. Thymolipomas are distinct from thymomas, which do not have fatty elements, and mediastinal lipomatosis, which does not have these nodular elements. Thymolipomas are never associated with elevated tumor markers, including β-human chorionic gonadotropin, α-fetoprotein, or lactate dehydrogenase, differentiating them from germ cell tumors. Thymolipomas tumors can be mistaken for myelolipomas, which are very rare. On gross morphologic examination, thymic nests in thymolipomas are salmon-colored and dispersed throughout the predominantly fatty tumor (Figure 2). Histologic analysis of thymolipomas shows mature fat and thymic tissue with lack of Hassall corpuscles and intervening areas of fibrosis. In contrast, myelolipomas reveal hallmark bone marrow elements on histologic examination.4 Thymolipomas have been proposed to develop due to regression of a hyperplastic thymus, lipoma formation within thymic tissue, or hamartoma formation in the thymus.5Gross analysis. Cut section reveals a predominantly fatty tumor with islands of salmon-colored nests representing thymic tissue (black asterisks).This patient presented with presyncope and dyspnea likely resulting from caval compression.

1053,"Lymphomatoid papulosis (LP) is characterized by chronic and recurrent cutaneous papules and nodules that spontaneously regress without treatment.1 The disease is more common in males, with a median age of 50 to 55 years at diagnosis. The life span of skin lesions typically ranges from 4 to 8 weeks but may last up to several months. Lesions are usually less than 2 cm in diameter and may occur in a solitary pattern or multiple crops involving any part of the body. Some patients have associated pruritus, which may heal with scar formation; however, accompanying constitutional symptoms are absent in most cases. Early lesions typically show a limited number of perivascular lymphocytes; however, large atypical cells accumulate in the advanced lesions.1 Furthermore, neutrophilic infiltration is frequently observed in the epidermis of the involved lesions.1Lymphomatoid papulosis is classified as a primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder along with primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL).2 Accordingly, LP is uniformly positive for CD30, and may be positive for CD25, CD71, CD3, CD4, CD8, and HLA-DR depending on subtypes.1 There are 6 major histopathologic subtypes (types A-E, LP with 6p23.5 rearrangement).3 Type A, the most common subtype, is characterized by a wedge-shaped infiltration of large atypical CD30-positive and inflammatory cells resembling Hodgkin lymphoma. Type B and C lesions show small and large atypical CD30-positive cell infiltration resembling mycosis fungoides (MF) and ALCL, respectively. Type D is characterized by epidermotropic infiltration of atypical CD30-positive/CD8-positive lymphoid cells resembling primary cutaneous cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma, and type E shows angiocentric infiltration of CD30-positive/CD8-positive small to large pleomorphic cells in dermis and blood vessels.3CD30 has been shown to interact with CD30L to activate the nuclear factor–κB pathway regulating cell death and proliferation in active B and T cells, but the mechanistic role of CD30 in LP remains unexplained.4 Other chromosomal and genetic abnormalities such as aneuploidy have been identified in LP although t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, a characteristic marker of systemic ALCL, is typically absent in LP.5 The underlying mechanisms of spontaneous regression in LP are largely unknown, although several hypotheses, including low and high expression of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 family proteins and higher apoptotic vs proliferation ratio, have been suggested.6Owing to variability in the results of histopathologic analysis depending on evolutionary course of disease, LP is often misdiagnosed. As well, the histologic patterns and immunophenotypes largely overlap with other cutaneous lymphoid malignant neoplasms such as primary cutaneous ALCL, transformed MF, Sézary syndrome, and adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. Because benign skin lesions from pityriasis lichenoides, lymphomatoid drug eruption, viral infection, and insect bites can mimic LP, a thorough history and physical examination, viral serologic testing, and expert pathologic review are essential in differentiating LP from other benign disease. Clinical features pointing toward a disorder other than LP include constitutional complaints, lymphadenopathy, and organomegaly. Moreover, molecular workup such as TCR gene rearrangement, flow cytometry, immunohistochemical staining, and cytogenetic testing is essential to differentiate LP from other malignant neoplasms including ALCL, MF, Sézary syndrome, and T-cell leukemia and lymphoma.The life expectancy of patients with LP is similar to that of the general population, but 10% to 25% develop other types of lymphoid malignant neoplasms such as MF (61%), cutaneous ALCL (26%), Hodgkin lymphoma (4%), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (4%).7 Male sex, subtypes B and C, and TCR-γ gene rearrangement have been shown to be associated with increased risk of lymphoma.7,8 Although the mechanisms of transformation remain elusive, monoclonal TCR gene rearrangement has been identified in both cutaneous lesions of LP and associated lymphoid malignant cells, supporting the clonal relationship between these 2 entities.9Asymptomatic patients with LP do not need treatment, and a watch-and-wait strategy is reasonable for them.

The clinical presentation of the patient, including the recent onset of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and the findings from flexible sigmoidoscopy showing congested and erythematous mucosa, strongly suggest idelalisib-induced colitis. Idelalisib, a PI3K inhibitor used in the treatment of follicular lymphoma, is known to cause gastrointestinal side effects, including colitis. The negative stool cultures and Clostridium difficile assay further support that this is not an infectious cause. Additionally, the patient's history of receiving idelalisib for 5 months aligns with the timing of the colitis development. Therefore, idelalisib-induced colitis is the most appropriate diagnosis in this case.",,,,,,

Parasitic cysts are usually seen in endemic areas and are mostly caused by Echinococcus granulosus. Based on the presence or absence of an epithelial lining of the lumen, nonparasitic cysts are further subdivided into primary cysts, including congenital and neoplastic, and secondary cysts, including traumatic and necrotic,2 which are also called false cysts or pseudocysts.3An accurate preoperative diagnosis of primary or secondary cysts is sometimes difficult. However, because epithelial cells are often positive for carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen as detected by immunochemistry and because patients with epithelial cysts may have elevated levels of serum tumor-associated antigens, the elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9 or carcinoembryonic antigen levels may contribute to the differential diagnosis of primary or secondary cysts. In addition, both primary and secondary cysts are usually simple spherical cystic lesions, but the secondary cysts are more likely to present with peripheral calcifications. The most common cause of calcified splenic cysts is infection by E granulosus, but hydatid cysts usually have multiple compartments, and the organism is rare outside its normal geographic distribution.

In children, annular pancreas usually manifests as duodenal obstruction, while in adults, the anomaly may present with obstruction, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, or abdominal pain.3The preoperative diagnosis of annular pancreas is often challenging. Upper gastrointestinal series can show dilation of the stomach and first part of the duodenum and the stenosis of the descending duodenum. In computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, a ring of pancreatic tissue is seen encircling the narrow descending duodenum; however, carcinoma usually cannot be ruled out.4 Gastroduodenoscopy with biopsy can be helpful to exclude malignancy.

However, in up to 40% of patients, diagnosis is made at time of surgery.3,5Symptomatic, obstructing annular pancreas requires surgical bypass of the duodenum. Gastrojejunostomy or duodenojejunostomy is indicated in severe stenosis, while duodenoplasty and duodenoduodenostomy have been described for less severe cases.

In a study from Mayo Clinic over 72 years (1907-1980), only 16 cases of JGI were reported.3 The authors reported that intussusception generally occurred following a retrocolic gastrojejunostomy without gastric resection. The incidence of JGI is estimated to be 3 per 2000 of gastrojejunostomies.4 More recently, JGI has also been reported following Roux-en-y gastric bypass for obesity.The etiology of the JGI remains conjectural, with multiple factors including hyperacidity, long afferent loop, jejunal spasm–disordered motility, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and retrograde peristalsis being proposed. One of the more accepted hypotheses proposes that spasm or hyperacidity triggers disordered motility with functional hyperperistalsis in the jejunal loop causing intussusception.4On an anatomical basis (of intussuscepted loop of jejunum), JGI is classified into 3 types: type I, afferent loop; type II, efferent loop; and type III, both afferent and efferent loops. The type II retrograde JGI is the most common variety, accounting for up to 80% of cases.5Jejunogastric intussusception may present any time after surgery, ranging from 5 days to 35 years. Clinical presentation may be (1) acute, with sudden-onset epigastric pain associated with vomiting or hemetemesis, or (2) chronic recurrent, with history of recurrent abdominal pain relieved by vomiting, with spontaneous reduction.The acute presentation is a surgical emergency in view of the risk for strangulation of the intussuscepted bowel. Early diagnosis and prompt management are essential because a delay of 48 hours in the surgical correction increases the risk for mortality significantly from 10% to 50%.6 History of gastric surgery is an important clue to the diagnosis. Abdominal computed tomography helps in making a prompt diagnosis of JGI, as happened in our patient. In patients presenting with upper abdominal pain and hemetemesis, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is also diagnostic.At surgery, gangrenous intussusception entails necessary resection, whereas viable intussusception requires reduction and parietal fixation to prevent future recurrence.

The clinical presentation of sudden-onset upper abdominal pain and vomiting in an elderly woman with a history of gastric surgery raises suspicion for a gastric bezoar. Bezoars can form after gastric surgery due to altered motility and can lead to obstruction, which aligns with her symptoms.

The clinical presentation of sudden-onset upper abdominal pain and vomiting in an elderly man with a history of gastric surgery raises suspicion for a gastric bezoar. Bezoars can form after gastric surgery due to altered motility and can lead to obstruction, which aligns with the symptoms described. The unremarkable initial blood tests and the absence of significant abdominal distension further support this diagnosis, as bezoars typically do not cause severe systemic symptoms unless there is a complication. Other options, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors or intussusception, would likely present with more severe symptoms or abnormal lab findings. Therefore, a gastric bezoar is the most fitting diagnosis in this case.",,,,,,
1158,"The contrast enhanced computed tomographic scan reveals a target mass in the stomach suggestive of intussusception (Figure 1). The appearance is due to the intussusceptum in the center and the edematous intussuscipiens forming the external ring.1 A strangulated intussusception may be differentiated by the appearance of an amorphous mass with intramural air. In this patient with a history of gastric surgery, a diagnosis of jejunogastric intussusception (JGI) of gastrojejunostomy was made (Figure 2).Abdominal computed tomography with intussuscepted intragastric jejunal loops.At emergent laparotomy, there was retrograde intussusception of the efferent loop of previous gastrojejunostomy. On reduction, the intussusceptum was found to be viable and was fixed to parieties. The patient is currently well more than 2 years after surgery.The JGI first described by Bozzi2 in 1914 is an uncommon condition. In a study from Mayo Clinic over 72 years (1907-1980), only 16 cases of JGI were reported.3 The authors reported that intussusception generally occurred following a retrocolic gastrojejunostomy without gastric resection. The incidence of JGI is estimated to be 3 per 2000 of gastrojejunostomies.4 More recently, JGI has also been reported following Roux-en-y gastric bypass for obesity.The etiology of the JGI remains conjectural, with multiple factors including hyperacidity, long afferent loop, jejunal spasm–disordered motility, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and retrograde peristalsis being proposed.

The patient's history of gastric surgery and the presentation of sudden-onset upper abdominal pain and vomiting suggest a complication related to the previous surgery. Gastric bezoars are common in patients with a history of gastric surgery due to altered motility and changes in gastric anatomy, which can lead to the formation of a mass of indigestible material. The unremarkable initial blood tests and the specific symptoms align well with a gastric bezoar, as it can cause obstruction and discomfort.

It occurs in less than 10% of patients with AML and only rarely antedates systemic bone marrow AML.1 In MDS, the incidence of myeloid sarcoma is less well characterized, but in the 30-year period from January 1965 to January 1994, only 46 cases of extramedullary myeloid tumor (including leukemia cutis) were reported.2 Interestingly, AML with bone marrow involvement developed in only 47% of these patients at a mean of 38 weeks from the initial extramedullary myeloid tumor.2 The much lower incidence of progression to AML with bone marrow involvement in MDS-associated myeloid sarcoma stands in contrast to truly isolated myeloid sarcoma, in which progression to AML with bone marrow involvement invariably occurs. Perhaps owing to the much lower incidence of progression to overt AML in MDS-associated myeloid sarcoma, patients who received chemotherapy for MDS-associated myeloid sarcoma demonstrated inferior survival compared with those who received conservative therapy only.2In addition to myeloid sarcoma and leukemia cutis, MDS can have protean autoimmune manifestations that have an effect on multiple organ systems. Of patients with MDS, 10% to 30% show signs of autoimmune disease, including vasculitis, seronegative polyarthritis, and skin lesions, including Sweet syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum.3 Treatment for autoimmune manifestations of MDS includes corticosteroids and treatment for the underlying disease, the mainstay of which in high-risk disease is hypomethylating agents.Myeloid sarcoma most frequently occurs in the soft tissues, bones, periosteum and lymph nodes.1 Intraoral myeloid sarcoma lesions are rare and commonly present as a symptomatic enlargement of the gingiva, palate and/or buccal mucosa.4,5 Intraoral lesions are considered clinically aggressive with possible invasion of adjacent soft and/or hard tissues.4 These tumors often have a nonspecific clinical and histological appearance; however, immunohistochemical analysis can establish a definitive diagnosis.6,7Isolated myeloid sarcoma invariably is followed by systemic involvement with acute myeloid leukemia and, therefore, if the patient is an appropriate candidate for intensive induction chemotherapy, he or she should be treated with such, similar to systemic AML. In addition, radiation therapy can have a role in the treatment of myeloid sarcoma. It can be used as a consolidative strategy following induction chemotherapy for isolated myeloid sarcoma, for rapid debulking and symptom control, or for palliation in patients who are not appropriate candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy.1In the case described herein, age and comorbid conditions precluded treatment with intensive induction chemotherapy, and the myeloid sarcoma was treated with radiation therapy. The patient received 30 Gy in 15 fractions via 9 MeV electron therapy with complete response. It is known that radiation therapy can achieve durable disease control at the targeted site,8 though the therapy is not definitive if there is bone marrow involvement with malignant abnormalities.With regard to his bone marrow disease, the patient began therapy with 5-azacitadine, 75 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5 and 8 to 9 each month. After 3 cycles, his hemoglobin level and platelet counts normalized and his absolute neutrophil count was approximately 800/μL. He has not been hospitalized and enjoys a good quality of life with mild fatigue continuing to be his major symptom. Interestingly, his del(16)(q11.1) cytogenetic abnormality had been previously described as being associated with myeloid sarcoma.9 This case highlights development of myeloid sarcoma in patients who do not have frank involvement with AML in the bone marrow.

Of patients with MDS, 10% to 30% show signs of autoimmune disease, including vasculitis, seronegative polyarthritis, and skin lesions, including Sweet syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum.3 Treatment for autoimmune manifestations of MDS includes corticosteroids and treatment for the underlying disease, the mainstay of which in high-risk disease is hypomethylating agents.Myeloid sarcoma most frequently occurs in the soft tissues, bones, periosteum and lymph nodes.1 Intraoral myeloid sarcoma lesions are rare and commonly present as a symptomatic enlargement of the gingiva, palate and/or buccal mucosa.4,5 Intraoral lesions are considered clinically aggressive with possible invasion of adjacent soft and/or hard tissues.4 These tumors often have a nonspecific clinical and histological appearance; however, immunohistochemical analysis can establish a definitive diagnosis.6,7Isolated myeloid sarcoma invariably is followed by systemic involvement with acute myeloid leukemia and, therefore, if the patient is an appropriate candidate for intensive induction chemotherapy, he or she should be treated with such, similar to systemic AML. In addition, radiation therapy can have a role in the treatment of myeloid sarcoma. It can be used as a consolidative strategy following induction chemotherapy for isolated myeloid sarcoma, for rapid debulking and symptom control, or for palliation in patients who are not appropriate candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy.1In the case described herein, age and comorbid conditions precluded treatment with intensive induction chemotherapy, and the myeloid sarcoma was treated with radiation therapy.

Given her history of lung cancer and the timing of the symptoms, radiation-induced myositis is a plausible diagnosis, as it can occur after radiotherapy and present with pain in the affected area. The absence of paresthesias or weakness further supports this diagnosis, as these symptoms are less common in myositis compared to other conditions. While metastatic disease could be a consideration, the acute nature of the pain and the timeline are more indicative of a radiation-related effect. Therefore, radiation-induced myositis is the most appropriate diagnosis in this context.",,,,,,
1184,"Hypofractionated radiotherapy (ie, stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT]) is the preferred modality of treatment for inoperable NSCLC, offering excellent local control.1,2 Chest wall pain is a known adverse effect of hypofractionated radiotherapy, with tumor location adjacent to the chest wall being the strongest predictor of toxic effects.3 In hopes of decreasing chest wall toxic effects, radiation oncologists frequently decrease the prescription dose or further fractionate the treatment (ie, smaller doses per day but more fractions).The biologically effective dose (BED) is used in radiation oncology for isoeffective dose calculations, most commonly to compare the potency of different dose-fractionation schemes. Onishi et al4 demonstrated a local control rate of 92% for patients receiving SBRT with a BED greater than 100 Gy, compared with 74% with a BED less than 100 Gy. Instead of our usual prescription of 60 Gy in 5 fractions for peripheral lesions, we delivered 60 Gy in 8 daily fractions5 with a volumetric modulated arc technique with 10 MeV photons given that the lesion was abutting the chest wall. The BED for the delivered regimen was 105 Gy.The T2-weighted MRI 5 months after radiation demonstrates a bandlike pattern of edema and inflammatory changes along the right posterolateral chest wall, with the 3500-cGy isodose line coinciding closely with the regions of T2 change (Figure 2). No rib fracture was identified on CT of the chest obtained 2 days prior to the MRI. The areas of inflammation include the subscapularis and serratus anterior muscles. It is possible the edema compressed the upper and lower subscapular nerves as well as the radial nerve—all arising from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.Radiation myositis is infrequently reported as skeletal muscle is relatively radio-resistant. Furthermore, a single report of functional imaging-detected radiation myositis mimicking a chest wall recurrence following lung SBRT has been published.6 Although the exact cellular response to acute muscle injury from ionizing radiation is unclear, animal and human studies implicate vascular injury leading to myofilament disruption and endothelial injury7 as well as release of amino acids, suggesting protein breakdown.8Because MRIs to evaluate soft tissue are rarely obtained following lung radiotherapy, this case highlights graphically and adds anecdotal evidence to the hypothesis that symptomatic chest wall toxic effects seen in a substantial percentage of patients undergoing lung radiotherapy may be attributable to acute muscle or nerve injury rather than to frank rib fracture.9 The patient was prescribed a 14-day tapering course of methylprednisolone to decrease the soft-tissue swelling, referred to physical therapy, and advised to continue pain and anti-inflammatory management. Eight months after therapy, shoulder pain was still present, albeit less severe.",1184_G_a_n_m,"1  
Gender has minimal impact in this case, as the clinical presentation and treatment decisions primarily revolve around the patient's age, medical history, and cancer diagnosis rather than gender-specific factors. While certain cancers may have gender-related prevalence, the management and outcomes in this scenario are not significantly influenced by the patient's gender.","C  
The patient's abrupt onset of severe right shoulder pain, localized to the scapula and radiating down the arm, occurring 5 months after receiving radiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer, suggests a possible complication related to the treatment. Radiation-induced myositis is characterized by muscle inflammation and pain following radiation therapy, which aligns with the timing and nature of the symptoms. The absence of paresthesias or weakness further supports this diagnosis, as these symptoms are not typical for myositis. Additionally, the patient's history of lung cancer raises the likelihood of radiation-related complications. Therefore, considering the clinical context and symptomatology, radiation-induced myositis is the most appropriate diagnosis.",,,,,,

The liver biopsy findings indicating vanishing bile duct syndrome align with the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, which can cause this syndrome due to lymphatic obstruction or direct infiltration. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, including elevated bilirubin levels, support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma.",,,,,,
1213,"A right cervical lymph node core biopsy was CD15+, CD20−, CD30+, consistent with classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Liver biopsy revealed absent bile ducts with associated hepatocellular and canalicular cholestasis. There was no inflammation, lymphomatous infiltration, or necrosis present. Staining for CK7 showed a decreased number of small bile ducts (Figure 2). A diagnosis of vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS) secondary to stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma was made.CK7 Immunostaining highlighting bile duct damage and reduction in number of surrounding bile ducts (original magnification ×40).Hepatic involvement in Hodgkin lymphoma is common and more frequent in advanced disease.1 Etiologies of cholestasis in these patients include direct intrahepatic parenchymal involvement, extrahepatic biliary obstruction secondary to lymphadenopathy, drug toxicity, and underlying liver disease. Paraneoplastic manifestations of Hodgkin lymphoma include idiopathic cholestasis and VBDS. Ductopenia, defined as loss of interlobular bile ducts in more than 50% of portal tracts within a histologic specimen, helps distinguish between these 2 entities. An ideal biopsy sample is 3 cm long with at least 11 portal tracts (>20 is optimal).2 Immunostaining for biliary elements may improve diagnostic yield. Direct hepatic involvement from lymphoma is absent in most specimens.Vanishing bile duct syndrome was first described in 3 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma presenting with severe intrahepatic cholestasis. Liver biopsy demonstrated absent bile ducts and a characteristic “burned out appearance” of the portal tracts.3 The cause of VBDS is unclear, but biliary duct damage due to cytokine release from lymphoma cells seems likely.4 No specific biliary epithelial-associated autoantibody has been found in Hodgkin-associated VBDS.5 Our patient’s disease was positive for Epstein-Barr virus, but this has no known association with VBDS.Historically considered a poor prognostic factor, VBDS was associated with a 1-year overall survival of 43% in a series of 37 affected patients.6 Hepatic damage appeared reversible. Improved outcomes in VBDS correlate with more efficacious lymphoma therapies. Hepatic impairment at time of diagnosis often limits use of optimal cytotoxic therapy. Subtotal lymphoid irradiation (STLI) for patients with early-stage nonbulky Hodgkin lymphoma has failure-free survival rates of 81% to 93%, compared with 94% to 96% with chemotherapy alone.7 For patients with VBDS and early-stage disease, definitive therapy with STLI is a reasonable treatment option. Patients with advanced disease can receive high-dose steroids and ursodiol to facilitate administration of dose-reduced chemotherapy.8 Development of antibody-drug conjugates with improved hepatic tolerance such as brentuximab vedotin offers new options for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma–associated VBDS.Our patient initially received corticosteroids, with minimal improvement in his cholestasis. Given his advanced disease, young age, and excellent performance status, a trial of dose-reduced brentuximab vedotin (1.2 mg/kg) was administered. After 3 cycles of dose-reduced brentuximab, repeat imaging showed partial response. Cholestasis improved but the patient’s intractable pruritus persisted. He started biliary apheresis with resolution of symptoms after 15 sessions.9 He had a complete response after 6 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine and has returned to work with no sequelae of treatment 1 year after diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient receiving up-front brentuximab to achieve temporary control of VBDS prior to definitive treatment with conventional chemotherapy.",1213_G_a_n_m,"2

The clinical presentation of the patient, including worsening abdominal pain, persistent pruritus, scleral icterus, and significant weight loss, alongside the findings of a large right supraclavicular lymph node and extensive lymphadenopathy, strongly suggests a malignancy. The liver biopsy results indicating vanishing bile duct syndrome align with the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, which is known to be associated with this condition. The elevated direct bilirubin level and the presence of hepatomegaly further support the diagnosis of cholestasis due to the obstruction of bile ducts, which can occur in the context of Hodgkin lymphoma. Other options, such as metastatic cholangiocarcinoma or acute hepatitis, do not fit the overall clinical picture as well as option D. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma.",,,,,,

Cardiac tumors are generally divided into primary (benign in 75% of cases) and include rhabdomyomas; and secondary from metastatic disease (100-1000–fold more common), which should be considered first.1 In absolute numbers, carcinoma of the lung and breast account for most cardiac metastases, but the highest percentages of cardiac involvement occur with melanoma, leukemia, and lymphoma.2In examining the possibilities of multiple intramyocardial masses, rhabdomyomas are more common in children and tend to regress with age. Melanoma deposits usually invade all chambers of the myocardium and are hyperintense on T1-weighted images due to the melanin component. Lymphoma invasion of the heart is grossly discernible, unlike leukemia, and can involve epicardium, myocardium, or endocardium in a patient with lymphadenopathy elsewhere.1,2 Our patient did not have evidence of widespread disease, prompting use of the genomic profiling assay, which has been shown to correctly identify the site of origin in 95% of cases of neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown primary.3Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) encompass a heterogeneous group of tumors that arise from neuroendocrine tissue and exhibit varied clinical behavior. The incidence has been increasing, and the prevalence is even greater due to the indolent nature of the disease.4 Pancreatic NETs are foregut derivatives; they have an incidence of 1/100 000 per year and account for 1% to 2% of all pancreatic neoplasms. The majority of them are functional, but 15% can be nonfunctional and present late with symptoms of local mass effect or metastasis.4 The World Health Organization grades gastrointestinal and pancreatic NETs using the mitotic rate and Ki-67 index. A high-grade tumor is classified on the basis of a mitotic rate of greater than 20/10 per high-powered field or a Ki-67 index of greater than 20%,4 as seen in our patient.Surgery is the standard of treatment for resectable pancreatic NETs, but most patients present with advanced disease that is unresectable and warrants systemic therapy.5 Multiple agents have been used for low- to intermediate-grade tumors. Somatostatin analogs (ie, octreotide acetate and lanreotide acetate) are usually first line therapy, due to their safety profile and possible antiproliferative effects.5 Biologically targeted therapies include the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitor sunitinib malate, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus, both of which showed a significantly longer median progression-free survival compared with placebo (11.4 vs 5.5 months for sunitinib and 11.6 vs 4.6 months for everolimus).6,7 Temozolomide, an oral alkylating agent, has shown variable response rates when used in combination with other agents. The most promising combination is with capecitabine, in which 30 patients with advanced pancreatic NETs showed 70% response rate and a median progression-free survival of 18 months.8 Prospective studies are limited to phase 2 single-institution trials.5Platinum-based chemotherapy (ie, platinum and etoposide phosphate) is first-line therapy for high-grade tumors, but some evidence suggests poor response (15% vs 42%) in tumors with a moderately high proliferation rate (Ki-67 < 55%).9 Temozolomide-based therapy is now commonly used as a second-line therapy after disease progression during platinum-based therapy.9 Our patient elected not to undergo platinum-based therapy in favor of a less toxic approach. She was therefore treated with octreotide long-acting release at a dose of 30 mg monthly and temozolomide at a dose of 200 mg/m2 on days 10 to 14, together with capecitabine at a dose of 750 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 14.

The incidence has been increasing, and the prevalence is even greater due to the indolent nature of the disease.4 Pancreatic NETs are foregut derivatives; they have an incidence of 1/100 000 per year and account for 1% to 2% of all pancreatic neoplasms. The majority of them are functional, but 15% can be nonfunctional and present late with symptoms of local mass effect or metastasis.4 The World Health Organization grades gastrointestinal and pancreatic NETs using the mitotic rate and Ki-67 index. A high-grade tumor is classified on the basis of a mitotic rate of greater than 20/10 per high-powered field or a Ki-67 index of greater than 20%,4 as seen in our patient.Surgery is the standard of treatment for resectable pancreatic NETs, but most patients present with advanced disease that is unresectable and warrants systemic therapy.5 Multiple agents have been used for low- to intermediate-grade tumors. Somatostatin analogs (ie, octreotide acetate and lanreotide acetate) are usually first line therapy, due to their safety profile and possible antiproliferative effects.5 Biologically targeted therapies include the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitor sunitinib malate, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus, both of which showed a significantly longer median progression-free survival compared with placebo (11.4 vs 5.5 months for sunitinib and 11.6 vs 4.6 months for everolimus).6,7 Temozolomide, an oral alkylating agent, has shown variable response rates when used in combination with other agents. The most promising combination is with capecitabine, in which 30 patients with advanced pancreatic NETs showed 70% response rate and a median progression-free survival of 18 months.8 Prospective studies are limited to phase 2 single-institution trials.5Platinum-based chemotherapy (ie, platinum and etoposide phosphate) is first-line therapy for high-grade tumors, but some evidence suggests poor response (15% vs 42%) in tumors with a moderately high proliferation rate (Ki-67 < 55%).9 Temozolomide-based therapy is now commonly used as a second-line therapy after disease progression during platinum-based therapy.9 Our patient elected not to undergo platinum-based therapy in favor of a less toxic approach. She was therefore treated with octreotide long-acting release at a dose of 30 mg monthly and temozolomide at a dose of 200 mg/m2 on days 10 to 14, together with capecitabine at a dose of 750 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 14.

1233,"Brain MRI revealed an enlarged, heterogeneously enhancing pituitary gland (Figure, arrowhead), with a thickened infundibular stalk and normal optic chiasm. Based on these clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings, the patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis (IH).Ipilimumab unleashes antitumor T-cell responses by blocking the CTLA-4 inhibitory molecule. However, the resultant T-cell activation may trigger immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). These include colitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, neuropathies, or endocrinopathies, such as hypophysitis.1,2The incidence of IH in patients with metastatic melanoma was approximately 1.5% in a large phase 3 study evaluating ipilimumab 3 mg/kg.1 Potential risk factors include male sex3,4 and older age.3 Newer anti–programmed death-1 (anti–PD-1) immune therapies induce hypophysitis in less than 1%, but in roughly 10% of patients treated with combination ipilimumab–anti–PD-1.5The clinical presentation of IH may include symptoms of mass effect (headache), compression of the optic chiasm (visual field defects), and glucocorticoid deficiency (easy fatigability, weakness, anorexia).6 Symptoms of IH usually develop 6 to 12 weeks after initiation of ipilimumab therapy.6 A high index of clinical suspicion is needed to prompt laboratory evaluation and therapeutic intervention. This condition can be life threatening in patients with profound adrenal insufficiency.6,7Pituitary assessment through hormone measurements and MRI establish the diagnosis. Initial MRI findings often include diffuse pituitary enlargement and homogeneous or heterogeneous pituitary enhancement with or without suprasellar extension.8 However, an unremarkable MRI does not rule out IH and does not preclude laboratory evaluation.9 Patients should be routinely and carefully monitored for IRAEs during treatment and follow-up. This should include laboratory and clinical assessment for hypophysitis. At least thyrotropin should be evaluated at every treatment, with a low threshold to check cortisol levels. Particular vigilance should be maintained after the third treatment dose.Ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis predominantly involves the anterior pituitary, notably the thyroid, adrenocortical, and gonadal axes. Preclinical models have recently identified CTLA-4 expression in thyrotropin-secreting cells in the anterior pituitary.2 This study also suggested that ipilimumab binds these cells and triggers the complement cascade and immune activation. Posterior pituitary dysfunction (diabetes insipidus) rarely develops.7Treatment for IH involves hormone replacement and possibly high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Close follow-up is needed to assess for resolution of hormonal deficiencies. Thyroid and gonadal function often normalizes, but cortisol deficiency may persist for years, and requires prolonged low-dose corticosteroid replacement (hydrocortisone 20 mg every morning and 10 mg every evening, or prednisone 5 mg daily).9High-dose corticosteroids are a staple for clinically significant IRAEs. Their use in hypophysitis, however, is controversial. Compared with physiologic glucocorticoid replacement doses, high-dose steroids do not seem to improve clinical outcomes as measured by speed or frequency of resolution.4 Common high-dose steroid regimens, if used, include methylprednisolone or prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/d for 1 week, tapered over approximately 4 weeks.7 Recent studies have suggested that corticosteroids do not compromise the activity of ipilimumab.7 Interestingly, hypophysitis may predict improved survival following ipilimumab therapy. A small, 17-patient cohort with IH had an improved median survival compared with unselected patients (19.4 vs 8.8 months).3 In addition, patients may safely continue ipilimumab therapy following IH and may be considered for anti–PD-1 therapy if subsequent therapy is needed.This patient had classic clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings.

Because delay is associated with higher mortality, it is necessary to make an early diagnosis using detailed examination and biopsy if a lesion is suspect.",1234_G_a_n_m,"3  
Gender is moderately relevant in this case as anal squamous cell carcinoma has a higher incidence in males, particularly those with risk factors such as smoking.

The clinical presentation of a painful anal mass, fecal incontinence, and rectal bleeding, combined with the characteristics of the mass (hard, ulcerated, and covered with purulent exudate), raises suspicion for malignancy. The size of the mass (12 × 10 cm) and its extension into the anal canal and perirectal space further support a diagnosis of anal squamous cell carcinoma, which is known to present with such features. The patient's age and smoking history are additional risk factors for this type of cancer. Other options, such as giant condyloma or abscess, would typically present differently and are less likely to cause such significant symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is anal squamous cell carcinoma.",,,,,,

As such, laparoscopic cholecystectomy and resection of the dilated cystic duct were performed as close as possible to the CBD (to prevent the high risk for malignancy) with reconstruction over a T-tube. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was also performed to improve common-channel biliary drainage. Histopathology findings revealed chronic cholecystitis, with no dysplasia or malignancy. Consequently, no further surgical resection was necessary and the patient remained well at follow-up.",1250_G_a_n_f,"2

The presence of a double lumen at the distal common bile duct, along with the finding of multiple gallstones in a dilated region of the cystic duct, suggests an anatomical variant involving the gallbladder. This aligns with gallbladder duplication, which can present as a double cystic duct. The patient's history of recurrent biliary colic and the findings from the intraoperative cholangiography support this diagnosis. Other options, such as biloma or choledochal cyst, do not adequately explain the specific anatomical findings observed. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is gallbladder duplication with double cystic duct.",,,,,,

The patient’s scheduled chemotherapy for that day was cancelled, and he was started on valacyclovir, 1 g 3 times daily. Rapid clinical diagnosis is critical when patients are receiving chemotherapy, especially with cytopenia, to minimize the risk of disseminated infection. Chemotherapy was resumed 2 weeks later when he had recovered from the herpes zoster and all lesions had crusted over.A history of primary varicella zoster infection is nearly universal in adult populations of North America and results in the diffuse vesicular rash of varicella (chicken pox).1 Following primary infection, the varicella zoster virus (VZV) establishes latency within sensory dorsal root ganglia; reactivation manifests as herpes zoster and is typically heralded by a painful, unilateral vesicular eruption in a dermatomal distribution. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates, 32% of Americans will experience herpes zoster during their lifetimes.2 The incidence of herpes zoster is higher in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with lymphoproliferative malignant neoplasms.3 In 13% to 50% of patients with lymphoma, herpes zoster may present with life-threatening, disseminated disease involving multiple, nonadjacent dermatomes as well as visceral sites.3 Disseminated disease is associated with a 6% to 17% mortality rate.4 In patients with cancer, an elevated risk of localized or disseminated VZV infection exists in patients specifically with Hodgkin disease, lymphoproliferative malignant lesions, lung cancer, and among those who received bone marrow transplantation.4The incidence of herpes zoster infection is significantly higher in patients with lymphoma compared with those with nonhematologic solid tumors, and risk factors include advanced stage and recent radiation therapy.5 A retrospective cohort study of adult patients with cancer noted the incidence of herpes zoster to be 31 per 1000 person-years for patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms and 12 per 1000 person-years in those with solid tumors. Patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms were twice as likely to develop herpes zoster as those with solid tumors and 5 times more likely than the general population.1Zostavax is a live, attenuated zoster vaccine, and administration may result in disseminated disease in the immunosuppressed. It is therefore contraindicated in patients with primary or acquired immunodeficiency states, including leukemia, lymphoma, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system.6 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices states that patients with leukemia in remission may receive the zoster vaccine as long as no chemotherapy or radiation was given in the past 3 months.6 Tseng et al7 suggested that the zoster vaccine affords effective protection when given to adults 60 years or older who subsequently were diagnosed as having cancer and had received chemotherapy.In summary, herpes zoster in the lumbar and sacral dermatomes can present with lesions in seemingly unrelated distribution (lateral thigh and plantar foot) and has multiple clinical presentations (wartlike and rashlike).

Histologically, gastric ectopic pancreas may be confined to the submucosa or involve the muscularis and serosal layers.8,9 Exocrine tissue is identified at the time of biopsy in approximately 50% of cases.5 Definitive diagnosis is sometimes elusive because overlying normal gastric mucosa can obscure lesions.Strong consideration should be given to surgical exploration in the case of suspected pancreatic heterotopia if symptomatic or to rule out malignancy when the diagnosis is uncertain. Localized excision is favored over a more extensive gastric resection when the diagnosis can be reasonably confirmed. Our patient underwent an open exploration and gastric wedge resection of the lesser curvature mass. A frozen section of the resected mass revealed ectopic pancreatic tissue. After an uneventful postoperative course, the patient’s abdominal pain completely resolved.",1267_G_a_n_f,"1  
Gender has minimal impact in this case, as the clinical presentation and findings are more indicative of the underlying pathology rather than being influenced by the patient's gender.

The clinical presentation, including the patient's age, history of significant weight loss, and the imaging findings of a hypervascular and exophytic mass in the gastric antrum, strongly suggest a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The biopsy results showing benign and reactive glandular cells do not rule out GIST, as these tumors can sometimes present with non-diagnostic biopsies. The presence of locoregional lymphadenopathy further supports the likelihood of a neoplastic process rather than a benign condition. While gastric cancer is a consideration, the specific characteristics of the mass and the patient's presentation align more closely with GIST. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is gastrointestinal stromal tumor.",,,,,,

These radiographic findings are pathognomonic for IPMN and are indicative of a malignant neoplasm.4 In our patient’s case, they signified the presence of invasive adenocarcinoma.According to the international consensus guidelines for the management of IPMN, all MD-IPMN lesions should be completely resected with negative margins in patients who are good surgical candidates.2 Our patient underwent a total pancreatectomy and splenectomy given the diffuse nature of his disease. A heterogeneous 7.0 × 3.5 × 3.4-cm pancreatic head mass was removed that involved the whole body and tail of the pancreas, with multiple papillary projections in the lumen (Figure 2). Involvement of the ampulla of Vater was noted and a polypoid pedunculated tumor (3.2 × 2.7 × 2.0 cm) was found adjacent to the papilla (Figure 2). The final pathologic feature was reported as invasive adenocarcinoma arising from a pancreatobiliary-type IPMN. Of the 4 histologic subtypes for IPMN, the type with pancreatobiliary histologic features has been reported to have the poorest prognosis, with an associated 5-year survival of 35.6%, while the intestinal, oncocytic, and gastric intestinal subtypes have rates of 86.8%, 75.0%, and 70.0%, respectively.5Gross pathologic image of resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. A heterogeneous 7.0 × 3.5 × 3.4-cm pancreatic head mass was removed that involved the body and tail of the pancreas, with multiple papillary projections in the lumen (white arrowhead). A polypoid pedunculated tumor (3.2 × 2.7 × 2.0 cm) was found at the ampulla of Vater (black arrowhead).The other answer choices provided would have presented differently on imaging. Mucinous cystic neoplasms typically present as a thick-walled single cyst located in the pancreatic neck, body, or tail, often with septations and nodules or calcifications6; serous cystadenomas generally appear anywhere in the pancreas as a spongy multilobular mass, often with central calcifications6; and duodenal carcinoids can manifest as intramural or intraluminal polypoid masses that show arterial-phase enhancement.7Here we describe findings from a classic radiographic image of an MD-IPMN that was corroborated by the surgical and pathologic findings.",1283_G_a_n_m,"1  
Gender has minimal impact in this case as the clinical presentation and diagnosis are primarily influenced by the patient's symptoms and imaging findings rather than gender-specific factors. While certain pancreatic and gastrointestinal conditions may have gender prevalence, the current clinical situation does not indicate any gender-specific issues that would significantly alter the diagnosis or treatment approach.","B  
The clinical presentation, including the significant weight loss, diarrhea, and the findings of a duodenal mass involving the ampulla of Vater and the head of the pancreas, suggests a neoplastic process. The imaging description indicates a heterogeneous solid mass, which is characteristic of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). These tumors often present with obstructive symptoms due to their location and can lead to weight loss and gastrointestinal symptoms. The absence of jaundice and the specific location of the mass further support the diagnosis of an IPMN rather than other options like mucinous cystic neoplasm or serous cystadenoma, which typically have different presentations. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.",,,,,,

All resection margin findings were negative for exposure of cancer.Intraoperative photograph of exploratory laparotomy revealing 2 isolated tumors: the 15-cm primary tumor located at segment 3 of the liver invading into the distal stomach and the other 12-cm mass in the lessor sac adhered to the superior border of the pancreas.Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare entity of liver primary malignancy. In the United States, the incidence of FL-HCC is 0.02 per 100 000 per year and it is approximately 100 times less common than conventional non-FL HCC.1,2 Unlike non–FL-HCC, FL-HCC often affects younger patients without underlying chronic liver disease. In addition, FL-HCC constitutes one of the major liver primary tumors among pediatric and young adult patients.3 Patients with FL-HCC typically present with nonspecific abdominal pain/discomfort or may not present with any symptoms and the tumor(s) may be discovered incidentally during workup of an unrelated medical condition, as with our patient. The histological diagnosis can be made preoperatively by fine-needle aspiration or core needle biopsy.Although the current data regarding the natural history and inherited biology of FL-HCC are limited, aggressive surgical resection has been recommended even for patients with advanced disease given its favorable long-term outcome. Mavros et al3 reviewed 19 previously reported case series including 206 patients with FL-HCC and demonstrated good long-term outcomes of patients who underwent surgical resection, with 18.5 years of median overall survival. Notably, in a series of 41 patients with FL-HCC who underwent resection from the University of Pittsburgh, 37 patients (90%) had stage IVA or IVB disease and their 5-year overall survival rates were still 66%, and 50%, respectively.4 On the other hand, however, the recurrence of FL-HCC after complete resection is not uncommon. In another series, the recurrence-free survival was reported as only 18% at 5 years and the sites of recurrence included the liver, lymph nodes, peritoneum, and lung.2 In fact, most long-term survivors underwent repeat resection(s) of recurrent disease in these series.2,4There is no consensus for the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and the optimal regimens for FL-HCC owing to the paucity of this disease. Our patient competed gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy and the recurrence was discovered at 6 months from the initial resection. She underwent repeat hepatectomy and is currently disease free.",1299_G_a_n_f,"2

Further workup revealed no other sites of disease, and Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) was diagnosed.Contrast-enhanced MRI is the preferred imaging technique for evaluating PCNSL because it is useful for staging and biopsy planning (ability to identify spinal and/or leptomeningeal involvement). Histologically, PCNSL demonstrates dense cellular lesions that have the classic appearance of isodense to hyperdense areas on computed tomography scans and isointense to hypointense regions on T1-weighted MRI scans, which are hyperintense to white matter on T2-weighted MRI images. Unlike metastatic lesions, which often have a distinct border with contiguous brain parenchyma, PCNSL often demonstrates an infiltrative pattern within brain parenchyma. These lesions typically exhibit intense, homogeneous enhancement after contrast administration. In a study that looked at MRI features in 100 patients with PCNSL,1 only 1 patient had lesions that did not have strong or moderately strong contrast enhancement. Ring enhancement of the lesions can be seen in cases of PCNSL in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but such enhancement is considered a rare finding in immunocompetent patients.2In the same study,1 90 of a subpopulation of 96 patients with PCNSL had significant edema on MRI imaging. Along with contrast enhancement, surrounding edema is another classic finding with PCNSL, which often results in local mass effect.In immunocompetent patients, PCNSL most frequently presents as a single lesion. In some cases, however, it can present as multiple lesions, which is a typical imaging finding in patients with HIV lymphoma. In the review of 100 patients with PCNSL,1 it was found that 65% of patients presented with only 1 lesion.Most frequently involving the cerebral hemispheres, PCNSL can also involve all areas of the craniospinal axis, including brain parenchyma, leptomeninges, spinal cord, and eyes. Within the brain itself, PCNSL can involve the cortex, deep structures such as basal ganglia, corpus callosum, and periventricular regions.3 Of 100 patients with PCNSL,1 cerebral hemispheric involvement was present in 38% (most commonly in the frontal lobes). The basal ganglia were involved in 16% of cases, corpus callosum in 14%, and periventricular regions in 14%. Leptomeningeal and cerebellar involvement was found to be the least likely location.1Primary central nervous system lymphoma can also present with ocular involvement, estimated to be present in 10% to 20% of patients with PCNSL. Such ocular involvement often presents as uveitis or optic nerve infiltration on imaging.4Histologic verification of PCNSL with biopsy is necessary prior to initiation of treatment. Many patients with PCNSL who are symptomatic at presentation have lesions of considerable size with associated edema and mass effect and are consequently treated with corticosteroids to relieve the associated symptoms. The corticosteroids can rapidly “melt away” lymphomatous tumors, making stereotactic biopsy and resection difficult. Suspicion of PCNSL from imaging is crucial in the workup of these central nervous system lesions so that clinicians can refrain from prescribing corticosteroids prior to biopsy. An imaging-based suggestion of a diagnosis of PCNSL may allow for a diagnostic biopsy to be completed prior to initiation of corticosteroid administration. Quick implementation of treatment regimens can improve prognosis and quality of life for these patients.Our case highlights the notion that the characteristic features of PCNSL may be changing. Imaging of PCNSL in immunocompetent patients most commonly reveals a solitary infiltrative mass in the cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, or periventricular white matter.1,3 Recently, there have been increasing numbers of immunocompetent individuals presenting with multifocal intracranial lesions that involve both the supratentorial and infratentorial regions,2 as in our patient. Given the increasing incidence and insidious nature of PCNSL, it is essential to recognize this disease clinically and with imaging.

The highest prevalence of the disease is seen in South America, Asia, and parts of Africa; in the United States, it is most commonly found in immigrants. Echinococcus granulosus is a cestode that survives within an accidental host—humans, who become hosts through contact with infected canine feces or ingesting infected sheep organ meat. The cestode forms cysts with large fluid collections and septations; daughter cysts may also be present. The liver is the most common site of infestation (55%-70%), followed by the lungs and spleen (2.5%).1 The disease is often asymptomatic, and while infection in childhood is common, the slow-growing cestode is often diagnosed in adulthood. When symptoms manifest, they are commonly caused by compression of adjacent structures; the presenting symptom is frequently a dull ache. Patients may also experience dyspepsia or constipation.1Initial workup should include CT scan and serologic tests for echinococcal titers. Findings on CT scan supportive of echinococcal disease include a nonenhancing mass that may be cystic or solid. Following the death of the helminths, a calcified wall may develop (Figure 1). Serologic studies have a relatively high sensitivity and remain positive until 1 year after the organism has been cleared. However, there is a high false-negative rate in extrahepatic disease.2 Despite the availability of CT imaging and serologic studies, Moro and Schantz3 suggested that calcification, presence of daughter cysts, and patient history are useful in establishing a diagnosis. The importance of diagnosing and treating echinococcal disease is because of the possible complications, which include infection, rupture, and fistulization. Broadly, rupture of the cyst leads to potentially fatal anaphylaxis. Specifically, of concern in a large splenic cyst is the likelihood of traumatic rupture. Splenectomy has therefore become the criterion standard of treatment4; however, antihelminthic drugs are used as adjunctive therapy. Recently, spleen-preserving therapy has become increasingly common, especially in children. Spleen-preserving operations are reserved for solitary, small, and superficial cysts.5 While isolated splenic hydatidosis is uncommon, the spleen is the third most common location of echinococcal cysts, and recognizing the risk factors and presentation are paramount to diagnosing this disease and preventing potentially fatal complications (Figure 2).Spleen in situ after mobilization and lysis of adhesion.

After a 1-month hospitalization, she was discharged to hospice care and died 1 month later.The incidence of obstructed colon cancer is 30%.1 Often, these patients require emergency intervention but have a poor prognosis. Two options exist for management. Surgery, consisting of ostomy creation with or without resection of the primary tumor, has been the standard of care; more recently, self-expandable metal stents have been described in the palliative setting and as a bridge to curative surgery.In the early 1990s, Dohmoto et al2 described the use of self-expandable metal stents for the management of obstructing rectal cancers. When performed by experienced endoscopists, the procedure is associated with a high technical success rate and a low rate of procedural complications. In a series of 447 patients receiving colorectal stents, complications included 15 (3.4%) perforations, 3 (0.7%) deaths, 7 (1.6%) migrations, 7 (1.6%) cases of pain, and 2 (0.4%) cases of bleeding.3 Predictors of increased risk of perforation include bevacizumab therapy, whereas other studies4,5 have found no predictors of early complications. Patients with metastases and those who received chemotherapy are more likely to have late complications.5 The length of the stent and the site of obstruction do not play a significant role in complication rates.6,7 However, more acute angular positioning of the stent increases the risk of bowel perforation.8Previous meta-analyses9,10 have found that the length of stay, mortality, medical complications, and stoma formation were reduced after self-expandable metal stent insertion for malignant bowel obstruction compared with emergency surgical intervention.Our patient’s stent angulation was acute. She had extensive disease with multiple fistulas to the small bowel and bladder. We believe the aforementioned factors placed her at a high risk for stent perforation; thus, she would have been a better candidate for surgical intervention with a diverting ostomy. The patient did not want a stoma and was determined to start chemotherapy with the hope of future curative surgery. With stent placement, she would start chemotherapy within a week; with surgery, she would have to wait 4 to 6 weeks before the initiation of chemotherapy. For these reasons, stent placement was attempted.There are no randomized clinical trials to determine whether colonic stent placement in the setting of acute colonic obstruction is advantageous. The use of colonic stents for the management of obstructing colorectal cancers is a potential alternative to surgery in carefully selected patients. However, complications after stent placement can be catastrophic and challenging, as demonstrated in this case. A surgeon should be available to manage such complications.",1373_G_o_o_f,"2

While colon cancer perforation could be a consideration, the immediate context of the stent placement and subsequent peritonitis strongly points to stent perforation as the cause of the free air.

When performed by experienced endoscopists, the procedure is associated with a high technical success rate and a low rate of procedural complications. In a series of 447 patients receiving colorectal stents, complications included 15 (3.4%) perforations, 3 (0.7%) deaths, 7 (1.6%) migrations, 7 (1.6%) cases of pain, and 2 (0.4%) cases of bleeding.3 Predictors of increased risk of perforation include bevacizumab therapy, whereas other studies4,5 have found no predictors of early complications. Patients with metastases and those who received chemotherapy are more likely to have late complications.5 The length of the stent and the site of obstruction do not play a significant role in complication rates.6,7 However, more acute angular positioning of the stent increases the risk of bowel perforation.8Previous meta-analyses9,10 have found that the length of stay, mortality, medical complications, and stoma formation were reduced after self-expandable metal stent insertion for malignant bowel obstruction compared with emergency surgical intervention.Our patient’s stent angulation was acute. She had extensive disease with multiple fistulas to the small bowel and bladder. We believe the aforementioned factors placed her at a high risk for stent perforation; thus, she would have been a better candidate for surgical intervention with a diverting ostomy. The patient did not want a stoma and was determined to start chemotherapy with the hope of future curative surgery. With stent placement, she would start chemotherapy within a week; with surgery, she would have to wait 4 to 6 weeks before the initiation of chemotherapy. For these reasons, stent placement was attempted.There are no randomized clinical trials to determine whether colonic stent placement in the setting of acute colonic obstruction is advantageous. The use of colonic stents for the management of obstructing colorectal cancers is a potential alternative to surgery in carefully selected patients.

The clinical presentation indicates that the patient has a 9-cm obstructed sigmoid colon mass with fistulous extensions and numerous metastases, which is consistent with colon cancer. The development of generalized peritonitis and the presence of free air on CT following stent placement suggest a perforation. Given the context of the obstructed mass and the biopsy confirming moderately differentiated colon adenocarcinoma, the most likely diagnosis is colon cancer perforation. Other options, such as stent perforation or diverticulitis, are less likely given the specific findings of malignancy and the patient's history. Therefore, colon cancer perforation is the most appropriate diagnosis.",,,,,,

The incidence is estimated between 1% and 2% in the population, and it is the most common congenital anomaly of the digestive tract.1 Some potential complications of MD include hemorrhage, obstruction, inflammation, perforation, or intussusception, with a 4% to 6% lifetime risk of these events.2 While most pediatric cases of MD present as intestinal obstruction, GI bleeding is the most common presentation in adults.3The diagnosis of MD is notoriously elusive owing to nonspecific symptoms and difficulty in disease detection, with technetium Tc 99m pertechnetate scintigraphy sensitivity estimated at 75%.4 Recent advances in endoscopic techniques, including double-balloon enteroscopy, have improved the ability to identify the sources of occult GI bleeding, with one study quoting a diagnostic yield of 80.6%.5 Double-balloon enteroscopy was pioneered in 2001 by Yamamoto and colleagues6 and uses a thin endoscope and soft overtube, both equipped with latex balloons. With both balloons inflated, the overtube and endoscope can be concurrently withdrawn, creating an accordion effect within the bowel that allows for advancement of the endoscope through the overtube. Subsequent inflation and deflation of the balloons is repeated until visualization of the entire small bowel has been achieved.Bleeding associated with MD is most frequently due to peptic ulceration of the small-bowel mucosa adjacent to heterotopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum. This point highlights the importance of inspecting the surgical specimen to ensure the ulceration is included in the specimen. Failure to do so may result in continued bleeding. Meckel diverticulum is an important part of the differential diagnosis of occult GI bleeding in adults, and double-balloon enteroscopy may be a useful diagnostic tool.",1395_G_a_n_m,"1  
Gender has minimal impact in this case, as the clinical presentation and diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum are not significantly influenced by the patient's gender. While certain gastrointestinal conditions may have gender predispositions, the specific findings and symptoms in this case are not gender-dependent.","B  
The clinical presentation and findings suggest a diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum. The patient has an outpouching in the distal ileum with associated ulceration, which is characteristic of Meckel diverticulum, a congenital anomaly. The presence of hemeoccult-positive stool and iron deficiency anemia indicates gastrointestinal bleeding, which can occur due to ulceration in a Meckel diverticulum. Other options, such as intestinal duplication and small-bowel diverticular disease, do not typically present with the same combination of symptoms and findings. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are less likely given the specific findings of an outpouching and ulceration in the distal ileum.",,,,,,

1410,"This patient has neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). These patients have a high incidence of cutaneous and neural tumors, as suggested by the history of acoustic neuroma and dermal neurofibromas seen on examination. Computed tomographic imaging demonstrated a large, septated mass arising from the duodenum. A retroperitoneal needle biopsy demonstrated a spindle-cell tumor, and immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD117 (C-KIT) and CD34 (platelet-derived growth factor receptor α [PDGFR-α]), indicative of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). As discussed below, NF1 patients have a high incidence of a special type of GIST, uniquely lacking C-KIT mutations, thereby causing resistance to imatinib mesylate therapy. Hence, surgical resection is the most effective treatment in these cases.During surgical exploration, a large, encapsulated mass (15 x 11 x 7.5 cm) was found arising from the lateral aspect of the second portion of the duodenum (Figure 2). Because of this location, a pancreaticoduodenectomy was necessary to render the patient disease-free. Pathologic analysis demonstrated negative margins and a high-grade lesion, with 15 mitotic figures per 50 high-power-fields. The patient recovered appropriately from his surgery and was discharged home.The final resected specimen. The gastrointestinal stromal tumor is seen arising from the second portion of the duodenum.This case highlights the disparity between immunohistochemical and molecular definitions of GISTs, and the growing complexity of our understanding of its pathophysiology. GISTs represent a variety of mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. As exemplified by our patient, spindle-cell histology and GI bleeding are common findings.1 Originally thought of as variants of leiomyomas or leiomyosarcomas, GISTs have been redefined due to advances in immunohistochemical staining, with nearly 95% expressing either CD117 (C-KIT) or CD34 (PDGFR-α).1 With advances in molecular biology, we now know that C-KIT and PDGFR-α are tyrosine kinase receptors heavily involved in cell signaling. Molecular analysis of most GISTs demonstrates “gain-of-function” mutations that constitutively activate these receptors, thus activating downstream RAS-MAP kinase pathways, promoting uncontrolled growth2,3 Most of these mutations are well-characterized and map to certain exons in the C-KIT and PDGFR-α genes. These C-KIT and PDGFR-α receptors are specifically targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, which has led to revolutionary treatment options for unresectable and metastatic GIST.1Neurofibromatosis type 1 shares a unique association with GIST, with the incidence of GIST in NF1 patients ranging from 5-25% in population-based studies.3,4 Although most NF1-associated GISTs demonstrate positive immunohistochemical staining for C-KIT, molecular analysis of these tumors shows that most express wild-type C-KIT and PDGFR-α receptors, which do not share the same mutations typically seen in non-NF1 sporadic GISTs.2,5 These wild-type receptors behave differently than the hyperactivated receptors typically found in non-NF1 GISTs, and the result is near-complete insensitivity to anti-tyrosine kinase therapy, despite positive immunohistochemical staining for C-KIT.2 Interestingly, NF1 is caused by a defect in the neurofibromin gene, which is a negative regulator of the RAS-Map kinase pathway.2,6 Thus, presumably the same downstream pathways are ultimately dysregulated in NF1 GIST disease, albeit by a different inciting mechanism – one which bypasses C-KIT and PDGFR-α.2,6 As a result, imatinib is typically ineffective in the treatment of NF1-associated GISTs. Indeed, molecular analysis confirmed that our patient had none of the typical C-KIT or PDGFR-α mutations seen in non-NF1 GISTs; therefore, resection was the only treatment option. As our understanding of the molecular biology behind GISTs evolves, mutational analysis has become increasingly important because of its ability to predict response to imatinib therapy.7,8 Six months after surgery, the patient remains disease-free.",1410_G_a_n_m,"1  
Gender has minimal impact in this case, as the clinical presentation and diagnosis are primarily driven by the patient's symptoms and medical history rather than gender-specific factors. While certain conditions may have gender predispositions, the information provided does not indicate that the patient's gender significantly influences the diagnosis or treatment decisions.","B  
The clinical presentation of the patient, including the recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, weight loss, anemia, and the presence of multiple cutaneous nodules, suggests a diagnosis of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). GISTs are often associated with abdominal masses and can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding due to ulceration. The complex, septated mass in the right upper quadrant seen on imaging aligns with the characteristics of a GIST. Additionally, the cutaneous nodules may represent associated syndromic features, such as those seen in neurofibromatosis, but the overall clinical picture is more consistent with a GIST. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.",,,,,,
1421,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become one of the most common surgical procedures performed in the United States, with many patients undergoing outpatient surgery with minimal pain and a rapid return to previous activities.

The clinical case describes a significant abdominal hernia with contents protruding through a 12-cm defect, which requires surgical intervention. Given the size of the defect and the presence of abdominal contents, a right thoracotomy with primary closure and mesh placement is appropriate to ensure adequate access and repair. This approach allows for direct visualization and management of the hernia, which is crucial in cases with large defects. Other options, such as laparoscopic or video-assisted techniques, may not provide the necessary exposure for such a large hernia. Therefore, option C is the most suitable choice for effective repair.",,,,,,
1433,"This patient’s hernia proved a diagnostic odyssey; the right 10th rib near the ipsilateral kidney’s lower pole was not appreciated preoperatively (Figure 2A). Repair proceeded through an open incision, as is our preference for a presumed flank hernia, particularly one containing multiple abdominal organs. We encountered pleura with a sac herniating posterior to the sternum, leading to the diagnosis of combined Morgagni and chest wall hernias. Consultation with our thoracic colleagues prompted sac inversion and diaphragm plication with nonabsorbable monofilament suture in a figure-of-8 fashion without entering the abdomen. Bioprosthetic mesh reinforced the intrapleural space between the ninth and 10th ribs, followed by polypropylene mesh onlay extending 8 to 10 cm beyond the fascial closure in all directions and binding with fibrin sealant (Figure 2B). Drains were placed between the bioprosthetic and hernia closure and subcutaneously, then vacuum dressing. She was discharged on postoperative day 12. At follow-up 2, 5, and 6 weeks later, she reported gradual to full function. Her incision healed well and the final drain was removed at week 6. At 6 weeks, she had a small right pleural effusion but no recurrence.A, Preoperative computed tomographic scan. B, Mesh placement.Giovanni Battista Morgagni described a diaphragm laceration “independent of any wounding instrument… from the ensiform cartilage and the neighbouring fibres. …the stomach was found in the right cavity, and the freedom from lungs indicated that this was an instance of malformation” in The Seats and Causes of Diseases,1 published in 1769 and translated by Cooke in 1824. Other translations suggest Morgagni transcribed a conversation about his eponymous diaphragmatic defect related by a Roman surgeon.2Congenital diaphragmatic hernias affect 1 in 3000 live births and demonstrate a postnatal survival rate of 50% to 75%.3 Defective rhabdomyoblast migration is the causative factor.4 Primary hepatic herniation, followed by the liver’s return to the abdominal cavity and ingress into the sac of more freely mobile abdominal contents or insufficient posthepatic mesenchymal plate development are hypothesized to cause congenital diaphragmatic hernias.5,6 Horton et al7 reviewed 295 patients and found most defects (91%) were right-sided; the balance were either left-sided (5%) or bilateral (4%).Clinical presentation varies. Vague abdominal symptoms were reported in some series, whereas others cited pulmonary and pain or pressure symptoms.4,7 Obstruction, dysphagia, bleeding, and gastroesophageal reflux disease may also be present. Horton et al7 found 72% of patients had symptoms. Physical examination is nonspecific. Chest radiography is ordered in 93% of cases, followed by CT scan in 47%.7 Reported CT scan sensitivity and specificity were 78% and 100% for left-sided defects vs 50% and 100% for right-sided defects, respectively.8 Horton et al7 noted that 40 of 195 published cases reported changing diagnosis during surgery.Isolated Morgagni hernias are amenable to multiple approaches, with successes published in all 8 permutations. Surgeons chose thoracotomy in 49% of the published cases.

Gender has minimal impact in this case, as the clinical situation primarily revolves around a significant abdominal wall defect and its repair, which is not inherently gender-specific. While certain conditions may have gender-related prevalence, the management and surgical approach remain largely the same regardless of the patient's gender.","C  
The patient has a significant abdominal wall defect with protrusion of abdominal contents, which is best addressed through a right thoracotomy. This approach allows for direct access to the defect, facilitating primary closure and the placement of mesh to reinforce the area. Given the size of the defect (12 cm) and the contents involved, a thoracotomy is appropriate for effective repair. Other options, such as laparoscopic or video-assisted techniques, may not provide adequate exposure for such a large defect. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is a right thoracotomy with primary closure and mesh placement.",,,,,,

Location varies, but the most common and anatomically consistent PAPVRs originate from the right pulmonary venous system and drain to the right atrium, superior vena cava, or inferior vena cava (Scimitar syndrome). Less frequently, PAPVRs occur between the left pulmonary venous system and the left brachiocephalic vein. Embryologically, PAPVRs are likely due to failure of regression of primitive lung drainage systems that connect each lung bud to the systemic system. As the embryo develops and the lungs mature, these connections normally regress and the pulmonary veins develop, connecting the lungs to the left atrium. Persistence of the primordial vein results in PAPVR.1 Autopsy and surgical series have suggested a PAPVR prevalence of 0.4% and have indicated that right-sided anomalous connections are 10 times more common than left.2,3 More recent advancements in imaging technology suggest that these anatomical variants may occur as rarely as 0.1% to 0.2% in the adult population, with nearly 50% present on the left side.4Although commonly asymptomatic, PAPVR can result in pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. As left-to-right shunting increases, volume overload of the pulmonary circulation leads to pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension.1,5 Pulmonary hypertension can be treated medically, and if there is dual drainage of the involved lung territory, minimally invasive embolization of the anomalous veins can be performed.6 In moderate to severe disease with a left-sided PAPVR, surgical treatment involves relocation of anomalous drainage to the left atrium. In a right-sided anomalous connection, the vein is most commonly relocated to the right atrium or right atrial appendage and an intracardiac tunnel or baffle is constructed in combination with a created or preexisting atrial septal defect to direct blood flow to the left atrium.Catheter placement in PAPVRs has been described,7,8 and Chintu et al7 advocate for routine fluoroscopy during catheter placement. While perhaps indicated with a known PAPVR, this may not be necessary if routine postprocedure chest radiography is performed to confirm catheter position. Physicians who place central venous catheters should be aware of PAPVR as a possible cause of catheter malposition. If this phenomenon is suspected, attempts should be made to confirm the presence of PAPVR and evaluate for hemodynamic effects.",1442_G_o_o_m,"1

This vein runs close to the internal jugular vein and can be inadvertently catheterized, especially if the catheter is advanced too far.

Embryologically, PAPVRs are likely due to failure of regression of primitive lung drainage systems that connect each lung bud to the systemic system. As the embryo develops and the lungs mature, these connections normally regress and the pulmonary veins develop, connecting the lungs to the left atrium. Persistence of the primordial vein results in PAPVR.1 Autopsy and surgical series have suggested a PAPVR prevalence of 0.4% and have indicated that right-sided anomalous connections are 10 times more common than left.2,3 More recent advancements in imaging technology suggest that these anatomical variants may occur as rarely as 0.1% to 0.2% in the adult population, with nearly 50% present on the left side.4Although commonly asymptomatic, PAPVR can result in pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. As left-to-right shunting increases, volume overload of the pulmonary circulation leads to pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension.1,5 Pulmonary hypertension can be treated medically, and if there is dual drainage of the involved lung territory, minimally invasive embolization of the anomalous veins can be performed.6 In moderate to severe disease with a left-sided PAPVR, surgical treatment involves relocation of anomalous drainage to the left atrium. In a right-sided anomalous connection, the vein is most commonly relocated to the right atrium or right atrial appendage and an intracardiac tunnel or baffle is constructed in combination with a created or preexisting atrial septal defect to direct blood flow to the left atrium.Catheter placement in PAPVRs has been described,7,8 and Chintu et al7 advocate for routine fluoroscopy during catheter placement. While perhaps indicated with a known PAPVR, this may not be necessary if routine postprocedure chest radiography is performed to confirm catheter position. Physicians who place central venous catheters should be aware of PAPVR as a possible cause of catheter malposition.

The clinical case describes a situation where a triple-lumen central catheter was placed in the left internal jugular vein, but the tip was not in the expected location. Given the context of the procedure and the anatomy involved, the most likely misplacement is into the left pericardiacophrenic vein, which can be accessed during attempts to place a catheter in the left internal jugular vein. This vein runs close to the internal jugular and can be inadvertently catheterized, especially if the catheter is advanced too far.

1449,"Laparoscopic exploration was offered to the patient, and she consented. A cecal thickening with complete appendiceal intussusception (AI) was seen during the procedure. No sign of even small foci of endometriosis was noted on exploration. The appendix could not be identified at the confluence of the teniae, and any careful attempt to reduce the intussuscepted appendix was unsuccessful. Given the risk of disseminating neoplastic cells if this was a carcinoid tumor or an adenocarcinoma or if foci of endometriosis were present, we decided to convert the procedure to open surgery (using a small, infraumbilical incision). The intussuscepted appendix on manual examination was extremely enlarged and remained difficult to reduce. It was very close to the ileocecal valve; therefore, we decided to perform an ileocecectomy. When the specimen was opened, the entire appendix appeared inverted (complete intussusception of the appendix, type V, according to the McSwain classification).1 Histologic examination of the specimen revealed several foci of previously unsuspected endometriosis. The patient’s recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged home on postoperative day 5. She was evaluated by a gynecologist and began receiving hormonal suppression of endometriosis.Intussusception of the appendix is a very rare condition, estimated to be 0.01% in a large historical study on surgical specimens of human appendixes.2 Since the first report by McKidd3 in a 7-year-old boy in 1858, the literature on AI has been limited to case reports or very small case series because of the rarity of this condition.4 In addition, endometriosis as a cause of AI is even more rare, with only 38 cases published.5,6 In fact, when endometriosis involves the gastrointestinal tract (usually one-third of patients with pelvic endometriosis), it commonly involves the rectosigmoid (72%) or the rectovaginal septum (13%) but rarely the appendix (3%).7 In the largest series published to date,8,9 the prevalence of endometriosis of the appendix ranged from 0.02% to 0.8%.Lesions within the lumen of the appendix may act as lead points for AI: peristalsis of the bowel loops drags the lesion forward and causes the invagination of a bowel loop with its mesenteric fold into the lumen of an adjacent portion of bowel. The most common cause of intussusception in children is appendiceal inflammation; among adults, inflammation as the cause is far less common. Endometriosis (33%) with hyperplasia or hypertrophy of the muscularis propria, adenoma/adenocarcinoma (17%), mucocele (14%), and carcinoid tumors (7%) are causes in most of the adult cases.2 A mobile appendix and mesoappendix as well as a wide appendicular lumen make AI more likely.10 An anatomical classification proposed in 1941 by McSwain1 and still in use is based on the portion of the appendix invaginated, ranging from type I (only the tip of the appendix) to type V (the entire appendix, as in our case).In adults, the intussuscepted appendix should be removed for 2 reasons: eventually AI will recur, causing symptoms, and the appendiceal lesion, which acts as lead point and causes the intussusception, may be malignant. Unfortunately, the nature of AI cannot be determined preoperatively in most, if not all, cases. At best, it can be suspected, for example, in women with a history of endometriosis. Colonoscopy reduction of an intussuscepted appendix is not recommended because of the risk of perforation and dissemination of a potentially malignant lesion with peritoneal seeding. Appendectomy is considered adequate when AI involves only the tip or the base of the appendix and can be easily reduced in the abdominal cavity. However, in case of complete intussusception of the appendix with a large mass close to the ileocecal valve, a lesion involving the base of the appendix, or a suspected malignant mucinous lesion, ileocecal resection or right hemicolectomy should be performed, either laparoscopically or with open incision, to achieve an adequate tumor-free margin. If endometriosis is suspected because of the patient’s medical history, laparoscopy is strongly recommended: if endometriosis is present it can reveal (although not in our case) yellow-brown discoloration of small patches in the ovaries, broad ligament, and other abnormalities, allowing a full evaluation of the extent of the disease. Gentle traction should be applied to the appendix in cases of AI with endometriosis, as with other causes of AI in adults. However, this maneuver should be performed with caution to avoid disseminating the foci of endometriosis. If reduction of the appendix fails, ileocecectomy or right hemicolectomy should be performed.",1449_G_o_o_f,"2

Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors are thought to occur via a benign fibroproliferative process and to develop atypical spindle cell features that are often associated with a recent history of surgical procedures. Typically, few mitoses are seen, and there is often a clear inflammatory component.3 However, PFTs are frequently misinterpreted as sarcomas. Sections of our patient’s tumor demonstrated spindle cell proliferation with bundles of relatively bland, tapered cells arranged in a swirling pattern. These cells were intermixed with smooth muscle bundles and overlying urothelial mucosa, consistent with bladder wall infiltration. Mitoses were rare, and there was a focal infiltrate of inflammatory cells. Trichrome stain revealed diffuse collagenous fibrosis. Immunohistochemical stains were useful in differentiating PFTs from other entities.The results of immunohistochemical stains were positive for smooth muscle actin, patchy positive for desmin, and focally positive for pan-keratin. There were scattered S100-positive cells. The differential diagnosis included leiomyosarcoma, given the smooth muscle actin and desmin positivity. However, leiomyosarcomas typically do not stain with keratin. A diagnosis of sarcoma or sarcomatoid carcinoma was considered, but the proliferative index was minimal (MIB1 [OMIM 608677] <1%) and the cytologic features were bland.

The S100 staining suggested the possibility of a liposarcoma, but our patient’s negative MDM2 and CDK4 immunostain results made this diagnosis less likely.4 Finally, KIT (OMIM 164920) negativity helped exclude a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.The finding that scattered cells were positive for S100 also suggested a neural tumor type, such as a neurofibroma, an intriguing possibility given the patient’s family history. However, neurofibromas in the bladder are rare, with only 60 reported cases.5 Neurofibromas are characterized by loosely arranged hypocellular fascicles with scattered spindle cells and collagen bundles.Our patient’s condition did not demonstrate these findings. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can occur spontaneously or in the setting of neurofibromatosis 1. These are rare tumors (incidence of 1 in 1 000 000 population) and typically have poor prognoses. An atypical neurofibroma can often mimic a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, but the latter is a true malignant tumor with variably increased cellularity, pleomorphism, mitotic figures, and aggressive phenotype.Having used combined clinical, radiographic, pathologic, and immunohistochemical findings to rule out other tumor types in the differential diagnosis, a final diagnosis of PFT was made. Although the term pseudosarcoma would suggest a benign biological process, these tumors can recur locally and metastasize hematogenously. On searching PubMed (with the keywords inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor), we identified 48 publications in which 31 of 409 patients (7.6%) developed metastatic disease. In one report, the rate of local recurrence and metastatic disease were as high as 55.9% and 10.9%, respectively.6 Given these risks, surgical resection with negative margins is the mainstay of treatment for these tumors.

Immunohistochemical stains were useful in differentiating PFTs from other entities.The results of immunohistochemical stains were positive for smooth muscle actin, patchy positive for desmin, and focally positive for pan-keratin. There were scattered S100-positive cells. The differential diagnosis included leiomyosarcoma, given the smooth muscle actin and desmin positivity. However, leiomyosarcomas typically do not stain with keratin. A diagnosis of sarcoma or sarcomatoid carcinoma was considered, but the proliferative index was minimal (MIB1 [OMIM 608677] <1%) and the cytologic features were bland. CD34 negativity helped exclude vascular tumors. The S100 staining suggested the possibility of a liposarcoma, but our patient’s negative MDM2 and CDK4 immunostain results made this diagnosis less likely.4 Finally, KIT (OMIM 164920) negativity helped exclude a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.The finding that scattered cells were positive for S100 also suggested a neural tumor type, such as a neurofibroma, an intriguing possibility given the patient’s family history. However, neurofibromas in the bladder are rare, with only 60 reported cases.5 Neurofibromas are characterized by loosely arranged hypocellular fascicles with scattered spindle cells and collagen bundles.Our patient’s condition did not demonstrate these findings. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can occur spontaneously or in the setting of neurofibromatosis 1. These are rare tumors (incidence of 1 in 1 000 000 population) and typically have poor prognoses. An atypical neurofibroma can often mimic a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, but the latter is a true malignant tumor with variably increased cellularity, pleomorphism, mitotic figures, and aggressive phenotype.Having used combined clinical, radiographic, pathologic, and immunohistochemical findings to rule out other tumor types in the differential diagnosis, a final diagnosis of PFT was made. Although the term pseudosarcoma would suggest a benign biological process, these tumors can recur locally and metastasize hematogenously. On searching PubMed (with the keywords inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor), we identified 48 publications in which 31 of 409 patients (7.6%) developed metastatic disease. In one report, the rate of local recurrence and metastatic disease were as high as 55.9% and 10.9%, respectively.6 Given these risks, surgical resection with negative margins is the mainstay of treatment for these tumors. In scenarios in which the disease is considered unresectable or when the patient’s comorbidities prohibit an operation, nonsurgical options may be considered. Because nearly 50% of them possess TPM3-ALK (OMIM 191030 and 105590) rearrangements that induce malignant transformation, these tumors may respond to ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib.7 This treatment may be used for converting unresectable to potentially resectable disease.Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors are rare lesions that surgeons must consider within the appropriate clinical context. Although most PFTs are considered benign, these tumors have the potential to behave in a malignant fashion. Surgical therapy remains the criterion standard for treatment of this disease. After resection of his PFT, our patient has had no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastases.",1450_G_a_n_m,"3

The clinical presentation and biopsy results suggest a diagnosis of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). The spindle cells with a low mitotic index and the patient's family history of neurofibromatosis 1 support this diagnosis, as MPNSTs are associated with this genetic condition. The immunohistochemical staining results, particularly the positivity for S100, further indicate a neural origin, which aligns with MPNST. The mass's characteristics, including its location and the erosion of adjacent structures, are consistent with the aggressive nature of MPNSTs. Therefore, given the clinical context and findings, MPNST is the most appropriate diagnosis.",,,,,,

The heterogeneous uterus noted on the patient’s imaging was, in retrospect, predictive of the intraoperative findings because uterine leiomyomas typically present as distorted soft-tissue densities on computed tomographic images. An alternative imaging approach would have been to perform a focused assessment with sonography for trauma examination at the bedside, which would have been the diagnostic method of choice had the patient been hemodynamically unstable. However, approximately 100 mL of hemoperitoneum is required before it can be detected by ultrasonography, and the source of bleeding is usually difficult to identify.6 Of note, ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for uterine leiomyomas.The injuries most commonly associated with blunt abdominal trauma include fractured solid organs, including the liver, spleen, and kidney, and ruptured viscous (usually duodenal rupture) and pelvic bone fractures with associated venous or urogenital injury. Although this patient’s final diagnosis was rare, as with any patient who presents after blunt trauma, a detailed physical examination and expedited imaging and operative management were essential to her favorable outcome.",1460_G_a_n_f,"3  
Gender is moderately relevant in this case due to the presence of a bulky uterus, which raises concerns about potential gynecological injuries or complications that are specific to female anatomy. Additionally, the management and outcomes of abdominal injuries can differ based on gender, particularly in relation to reproductive health considerations.","B  
The clinical presentation of diffuse lower abdominal pain, tachycardia, and the presence of a large hematoma in the left midabdomen, along with free fluid throughout the abdomen and pelvis, suggests a significant intra-abdominal injury. The irregularity of the right gonadal vein and the bulky uterus could indicate associated injuries, but the focal density consistent with a hematoma is more indicative of a mesenteric hematoma. The elevated white blood cell count also supports the possibility of an inflammatory process related to a hematoma. Given the mechanism of injury (motor vehicle collision) and the imaging findings, a mesenteric hematoma is the most likely diagnosis. Other options, such as avulsed uterine fibroid or specific organ injuries, are less consistent with the overall clinical picture.",,,,,,
1461,"This patient presented with recurrent bowel obstruction due to an extensive ileocolic intussusception. The diagnosis was made radiographically based on the presence of classic computed tomography findings, including targetlike and sausage-shaped masses, a rim of oral contrast encircling the intussusceptum, and the pathognomonic bowel-within-bowel appearance of intraluminal mesenteric fat and vessels (Figure 1).1Although the patient had hoped to avoid surgery based on her religious beliefs, nonoperative management failed at 11 months and she agreed to an operation. Intraoperatively, the intussusception extended from the ileocolic junction to mid-descending colon and was reduced primarily to reveal complete inversion of the appendix into the cecum. An ileocecectomy with primary ileocolonic anastomosis was performed and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 5. The appendix was reduced in the postoperative specimen and noted to be grossly fibrotic.This patient had a history of juvenile polyposis syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple gastrointestinal hamartomas in the colon or rectum (98%), stomach (14%), small bowel (7%), and duodenum (2%).2 Final pathology revealed a clustering of at least 8 juvenile polyps in the cecum extending into the appendiceal orifice, which was noted on colonoscopy performed during the patient’s first admission (Figure 2). Prior to surgery, an ileal mass was suspected as the most likely lead point for intussusception. However, intraoperative findings and final pathology suggested a different mechanism whereby the appendiceal masses initiated an appendiceal intussusception that then served as the mechanical lead point for ileocolic intussusception. Alternatively, the mass of cecal polyps may have acted as the initial lead point for intestinal intussusception and caused a secondary or simultaneous appendiceal intussusception by tethering the base of the appendix.Colonoscopic view of the cecum demonstrating extension of a cluster of juvenile polyps extending into the appendiceal orifice (arrowhead).

Surgical management is generally indicated since up to 90% of cases are associated with an underlying pathological process, such as benign and malignant tumors, vascular anomalies, and inflammatory lesions that act as anatomical lead points.3-6 Appendiceal intussusception is even more rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.01% based on a study of 71 000 human appendix surgical specimens.7 Patients may present acutely with symptoms mimicking appendicitis or have a more protracted history of nonspecific, intermittent symptoms similar to intestinal intussusception. Adult women are disproportionately affected (76% of adult cases, 54% of all cases), with appendiceal endometriosis as the most commonly identified lead point in adults (33%). Additional causes include mucocele (19%), inflammation (19%), adenoma (11%), carcinoid (7%), and adenocarcinoma (6%).8,9Intramural and intraluminal gastrointestinal lesions are believed to cause intussusception by altering normal peristaltic activity, resulting in more vigorous and frequent peristaltic contractions meant to expel the offending lesion.

Nearly 1000 pancreas transplants are performed in the United States annually, and with improving long-term graft functional success rates positively impacting patient survival,2 more and more adult, previously diabetic patients are alive with functioning pancreas transplants.3 Thus, it is important that all health care providers be familiar with the basic anatomy of a pancreas transplant, which receives arterial blood supply from the recipient iliac artery most commonly via a donor iliac Y graft and whose venous outflow can either be constructed via a donor portal vein anastomosis to the systemic venous system (via the iliac vein or inferior vena cava) or to the portal venous system (via the superior mesenteric vein). Pseudoaneurysms of the pancreas transplant arterial anastomoses have been reported and may be due to an error in anastomotic surgical technique, intra-abdominal infections, or injury during percutaneous pancreas transplant biopsies.4 Increasingly, endovascular prostheses are being used to treat arterial disease owing to a growing list of indications ever since the description of their first use by Sigwart et al5 in 1987.

1474,"Angioleiomyomas are benign, well-circumscribed, soft-tissue tumors of mesodermal origin arising from fascicular proliferation of smooth-muscle cells of the vascular tunica media.1 These tumors are rare and account for only 5% of benign soft-tissue neoplasms. Although the etiology of angioleiomyomas is unknown, evidence suggests trauma, chronic inflammation, venous stasis, and hormonal changes may play a role. Angioleiomyomas arise more often from veins than from arteries, and there have been reported cases involving vessels and in a variety of anatomical locations. However, a literature review did not reveal a single reported case of a common hepatic artery angioleiomyoma.Most patients with angioleiomyomas are female and usually present in the fourth to sixth decades of life with a small, solitary, slow-growing nodule within the subcuticular or deep dermal layers of the skin, usually in the lower extremities, head and neck, or trunk.2 Pain is the most common clinical feature associated with approximately 60% of cases. The pain is thought to be mediated by nerve endings within the tumor capsule responding to mechanical stretching or inflammation induced by mast cells.3Histologically, these tumors feature bundles of spindle smooth-muscle cells interlaced with vascular channels surrounded by a thin capsule.1 Degenerative changes with hyalinisation, myxoid changes, and calcification are sometimes seen. Angioleiomyomas are categorized into 3 histological types, namely solid, venous, and cavernous.4 The solid type is the most common and is characterized by closely compacted smooth muscle and many small, slitlike vascular channels. Thick muscular walls distinguish the venous type. The cavernous type is the least common and is differentiated by dilated vascular channels with a paucity of smooth muscle. Fine-needle aspiration is usually not sufficient to permit histotype diagnosis.Immunohistological examination of angioleiomyomas typically demonstrates uniform smooth-muscle cells that strongly express desmin and smooth-muscle actin. Angioleiomyomas usually lack nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and necrosis typically seen in malignant tumors with smooth-muscle differentiation such as leiomyosarcomas.5 CD34 expression in vascular compartments, but not in the tumor stroma, distinguishes angioleiomyomas from primary vascular neoplasms and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.6 In addition, the absence of cytologic atypia and interanastomosing vascular architecture excludes angiosarcoma. Karyotype analyses of angioleiomyomas have not demonstrated consistent chromosome aberrations although a number have been described.7Evaluation by ultrasonography reveals a well-defined, homogeneous, hypoechoic lesion that may demonstrate some posterior acoustic enhancement.8 Spectral Doppler analysis usually reveals considerable hypervascularity with waveforms of low resistance or high resistance, depending on the absence or presence of muscular vessels. Computed tomographic imaging usually demonstrates a solitary mass lesion with well-defined margins with heterogeneous density on unenhanced CT and gradual enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT.9 The area of early enhancement within the mass corresponded to large vessels filled with blood, and the nonenhancing area corresponds to bundles of smooth muscle and fibrous tissue.Surgical resection is usually curative with rare recurrences.2 In selected cases, preoperative endovascular embolization has been performed as an adjunct to surgery to facilitate resection.10In this case, the preoperative workup, including abdominal ultrasonography, CT, endoscopic ultrasonography, and fine-needle aspiration, did not reveal a clear diagnosis. At surgery, the lesion was dissected from the head of the pancreas inferiorly, the portal vein laterally, lymph nodes within the porta hepatis posteriorly, and left portal vein superiorly prior to dividing the common hepatic artery proximal to the tumor and the origins of the left and right hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries distal to the tumor. The tumor was then freed from the remaining posterior attachments, and vascular reconstruction was performed. Although angioleiomyomas are not malignant, local recurrence has been reported and thus close clinical follow-up is warranted. Based on multiple surveillance imaging studies, the patient is free of recurrence at 34 months from resection.",1474_G_o_o_m,"1

The clinical presentation and histological findings suggest a diagnosis of angioleiomyoma. The lesion is well-circumscribed, firm, and shows strong desmin positivity, indicating smooth muscle differentiation, which is characteristic of angioleiomyomas.

Computed tomographic imaging usually demonstrates a solitary mass lesion with well-defined margins with heterogeneous density on unenhanced CT and gradual enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT.9 The area of early enhancement within the mass corresponded to large vessels filled with blood, and the nonenhancing area corresponds to bundles of smooth muscle and fibrous tissue.Surgical resection is usually curative with rare recurrences.2 In selected cases, preoperative endovascular embolization has been performed as an adjunct to surgery to facilitate resection.10In this case, the preoperative workup, including abdominal ultrasonography, CT, endoscopic ultrasonography, and fine-needle aspiration, did not reveal a clear diagnosis. At surgery, the lesion was dissected from the head of the pancreas inferiorly, the portal vein laterally, lymph nodes within the porta hepatis posteriorly, and left portal vein superiorly prior to dividing the common hepatic artery proximal to the tumor and the origins of the left and right hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries distal to the tumor. The tumor was then freed from the remaining posterior attachments, and vascular reconstruction was performed. Although angioleiomyomas are not malignant, local recurrence has been reported and thus close clinical follow-up is warranted.

1474,"Angioleiomyomas are benign, well-circumscribed, soft-tissue tumors of mesodermal origin arising from fascicular proliferation of smooth-muscle cells of the vascular tunica media.1 These tumors are rare and account for only 5% of benign soft-tissue neoplasms. Although the etiology of angioleiomyomas is unknown, evidence suggests trauma, chronic inflammation, venous stasis, and hormonal changes may play a role. Angioleiomyomas arise more often from veins than from arteries, and there have been reported cases involving vessels and in a variety of anatomical locations. However, a literature review did not reveal a single reported case of a common hepatic artery angioleiomyoma.Most patients with angioleiomyomas are female and usually present in the fourth to sixth decades of life with a small, solitary, slow-growing nodule within the subcuticular or deep dermal layers of the skin, usually in the lower extremities, head and neck, or trunk.2 Pain is the most common clinical feature associated with approximately 60% of cases. The pain is thought to be mediated by nerve endings within the tumor capsule responding to mechanical stretching or inflammation induced by mast cells.3Histologically, these tumors feature bundles of spindle smooth-muscle cells interlaced with vascular channels surrounded by a thin capsule.1 Degenerative changes with hyalinisation, myxoid changes, and calcification are sometimes seen. Angioleiomyomas are categorized into 3 histological types, namely solid, venous, and cavernous.4 The solid type is the most common and is characterized by closely compacted smooth muscle and many small, slitlike vascular channels. Thick muscular walls distinguish the venous type. The cavernous type is the least common and is differentiated by dilated vascular channels with a paucity of smooth muscle. Fine-needle aspiration is usually not sufficient to permit histotype diagnosis.Immunohistological examination of angioleiomyomas typically demonstrates uniform smooth-muscle cells that strongly express desmin and smooth-muscle actin. Angioleiomyomas usually lack nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and necrosis typically seen in malignant tumors with smooth-muscle differentiation such as leiomyosarcomas.5 CD34 expression in vascular compartments, but not in the tumor stroma, distinguishes angioleiomyomas from primary vascular neoplasms and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.6 In addition, the absence of cytologic atypia and interanastomosing vascular architecture excludes angiosarcoma.

It can be associated with enterocele or other perineal hernias. From a clinical point of view, hedrocele can cause different but nonspecific symptoms, such as dyschezia, constipation, and tenesmus. The natural history of hedrocele is to progress and protrude through the rectum and then through the anus. The main complication is intestinal incarceration and strangulation in the hernia.

1481,"The patient underwent successful extirpation of the chest wall sarcoma. Intraoperative frozen section analysis revealed uninvolved radial margins. The parietal pleura displayed local fibrosis but was not invaded by the sarcoma. Final pathology confirmed the intraoperative findings and assigned a National Institutes of Health grade 2/3 to the lesion. The patient did not require additional adjuvant therapy and will be closely monitored for recurrence.Radiation therapy is an integral part of the accepted treatment protocols for many malignancies. Whole-breast irradiation in breast-conserving therapy and axillary irradiation are the standard of care in patients presenting with resectable malignancies of the breast. Postirradiation development of sarcoma is a rare but well-documented complication of radiotherapy for breast carcinoma. The risk of radiation-induced sarcoma (RIS) increases with latency time and the nature of the radiation field used. Modern fractionated radiation is associated with a decreased risk of RIS as compared with older unfractionated, transthoracic external beam radiation therapy. High-grade, eg, poorly differentiated, tumors are fast growing and associated with poor prognosis.1,2The clinical definition of RIS established in 1948 by Cahan et al3 remains practically unchanged to date. Patients are classified as having RIS if they have a history of radiation exposure prior to the development of sarcoma in or near the treatment field, with histological confirmation of a sarcoma that is unique from the primary cancer.2,3In patients undergoing radiation for breast carcinoma, the current reported incidence of RIS is 0.07% at 5 years, 0.27% at 10 years, and 0.48% at 15 years.4 The average latency for RIS is approximately 10 years. Although older case series suggest a higher incidence, these studies were in general small series and performed in the cobalt radiation era and without the benefit of dose fractionation. Longitudinal case series suggest that the survival rate for RIS treated with surgical resection is 40% at 5 years, with good outcomes for patients with low-grade tumors who undergo complete resection.5Chest wall tumors remain challenging to treat despite improvements in surgical technique. The surgeon must consider the factors of tumor size, location, previous radiation therapy, risk of infection, patient lifestyle, and prognosis when choosing a surgical approach.6 Patient outcomes for the excision of chest wall sarcoma are good, with published mortality rates less than 1%.7,8Wide resection is necessary to minimize local recurrence. The resultant tissue defect can be classified as either full thickness, involving the chest wall proper, or as a soft tissue defect alone. Large soft tissue defects can be reconstructed using skin grafts, local tissue transfer, pedicled myocutaneous flaps such as latissimus dorsi and rectus abdominus, or free flaps requiring microvascular anastomosis. Full-thickness defects with 2 or fewer resected ribs generally do not impair chest wall mechanics and do not require stabilization of the bony thorax. Historically, methylmethacrylate and mesh “sandwiches” were used to reconstruct the chest wall; however, these “sandwiches” encountered problems with delamination and infection of air pockets and are no longer as popular. Current reconstruction techniques of stable chest wall defects are accomplished using 2-mm-thick expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and other stable synthetic meshes/materials. Unstable defects including resection of 3 contiguous ribs segments, partial or complete sternectomy, or resection of the lateral chest wall are repaired using a combination of the aforementioned techniques in addition to stabilization of the bony thorax using titanium implants (Strasbourg Thoracic Osteosynthesis System [STRATOS]; MedXpert GMbH), maintaining good cosmesis and decreasing the risk of respiratory compromise.9-12Radiation-induced sarcoma is a rare disease; however, its incidence increases over time. The importance of timely lifelong evaluation of patients with breast cancer cannot be overemphasized. Early detection of recurrence as well as detection of de novo lesions improves long-term survival. Wide surgical excision with or without chest wall reconstruction results in good function and adequate cosmesis. Long-term follow-up of patients treated with radiotherapy is imperative for early detection and effective treatment of these malignancies.",1481_G_o_o_f,"4  
Gender is very relevant in this case as the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, which is significantly more common in females and influences the likelihood of developing secondary malignancies such as sarcomas. Additionally, gender-specific factors may affect treatment decisions, such as the choice of surgical intervention and reconstruction options, highlighting the importance of considering gender in the clinical context.","A  
The clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest a mass in the left chest wall that is distinct from the breast tissue, which is consistent with a spindle cell sarcoma.

Postirradiation development of sarcoma is a rare but well-documented complication of radiotherapy for breast carcinoma. The risk of radiation-induced sarcoma (RIS) increases with latency time and the nature of the radiation field used. Modern fractionated radiation is associated with a decreased risk of RIS as compared with older unfractionated, transthoracic external beam radiation therapy. High-grade, eg, poorly differentiated, tumors are fast growing and associated with poor prognosis.1,2The clinical definition of RIS established in 1948 by Cahan et al3 remains practically unchanged to date. Patients are classified as having RIS if they have a history of radiation exposure prior to the development of sarcoma in or near the treatment field, with histological confirmation of a sarcoma that is unique from the primary cancer.2,3In patients undergoing radiation for breast carcinoma, the current reported incidence of RIS is 0.07% at 5 years, 0.27% at 10 years, and 0.48% at 15 years.4 The average latency for RIS is approximately 10 years. Although older case series suggest a higher incidence, these studies were in general small series and performed in the cobalt radiation era and without the benefit of dose fractionation. Longitudinal case series suggest that the survival rate for RIS treated with surgical resection is 40% at 5 years, with good outcomes for patients with low-grade tumors who undergo complete resection.5Chest wall tumors remain challenging to treat despite improvements in surgical technique. The surgeon must consider the factors of tumor size, location, previous radiation therapy, risk of infection, patient lifestyle, and prognosis when choosing a surgical approach.6 Patient outcomes for the excision of chest wall sarcoma are good, with published mortality rates less than 1%.7,8Wide resection is necessary to minimize local recurrence. The resultant tissue defect can be classified as either full thickness, involving the chest wall proper, or as a soft tissue defect alone. Large soft tissue defects can be reconstructed using skin grafts, local tissue transfer, pedicled myocutaneous flaps such as latissimus dorsi and rectus abdominus, or free flaps requiring microvascular anastomosis. Full-thickness defects with 2 or fewer resected ribs generally do not impair chest wall mechanics and do not require stabilization of the bony thorax. Historically, methylmethacrylate and mesh “sandwiches” were used to reconstruct the chest wall; however, these “sandwiches” encountered problems with delamination and infection of air pockets and are no longer as popular. Current reconstruction techniques of stable chest wall defects are accomplished using 2-mm-thick expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and other stable synthetic meshes/materials. Unstable defects including resection of 3 contiguous ribs segments, partial or complete sternectomy, or resection of the lateral chest wall are repaired using a combination of the aforementioned techniques in addition to stabilization of the bony thorax using titanium implants (Strasbourg Thoracic Osteosynthesis System [STRATOS]; MedXpert GMbH), maintaining good cosmesis and decreasing the risk of respiratory compromise.9-12Radiation-induced sarcoma is a rare disease; however, its incidence increases over time. The importance of timely lifelong evaluation of patients with breast cancer cannot be overemphasized. Early detection of recurrence as well as detection of de novo lesions improves long-term survival.

They affect men 6 times as often as women and present at a mean age of 71.2 years.1 Isolated IIAAs are difficult to diagnose because they are deep in the pelvis and often present late as a result of complications. Our patient had chronic lower back and left-sided hip pain radiating down his leg during the previous 3 months. This had been getting progressively worse and transformed into bilateral lower extremity pain, and he was unable to ambulate on presentation owing to the severity of the pain. He also had scrotal and perineal ecchymosis for approximately 5 days and worsening urinary incontinence for the past 4 days. He had no bowel movements for the past 6 days. These symptoms were most likely due to compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots, the genitourinary system, and the rectum. The aneurysm was not ruptured; rather, it was almost completely thrombosed. A large area of ecchymosis was noted in the retroperitoneum, representing an extension of a retroperitoneal hematoma from a leaking IIAA found in the operating room. Up to 70% of patients with IIAAs can present asymptomatically and are diagnosed coincidentally on imaging studies for other reasons.1During the patient’s infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair 7 years prior, multiple IAAs were found, including a 3-cm right common IAA, a 5-cm right IIAA, and a left IIAA measuring 8 cm. The surgical treatment included exclusion of the right common IAA, proximal ligation of the right IIAA, and proximal ligation of the left common iliac artery just proximal to the aneurysm. The right and left external iliac arteries were transected, the proximal ends were ligated, and a Dacron graft bypass connected the aorta to bilateral external iliac arteries. Our patient was found to have a recurrence of the left IIAA only after proximal ligation. Decreased bleeding and morbidity owing to minimal dissection are benefits of proximal ligation; however, the aneurysm is not decompressed and this technique carries a risk of recurrence up to 33% owing to retrograde refilling from the hypogastric branches. Rupture has also been reported in this group.2 During the initial surgery, the distal end of the left IIAA was difficult to visualize and impossible to access without significant bleeding. The decision for proximal ligation was made to decrease the time and morbidity of the already extensive surgery. Even with total inflow occlusion, an IIAA can expand and rupture from retrograde flow from collaterals. Limited data correlate risk of rupture with size of an IIAA, particularly one of this caliber; however, it is believed that the risk of rupture increases with size. Richardson and Greenfield3 showed the mean size of an isolated IIAA at diagnosis to be 7.7 cm with a 33% incidence of rupture (n = 12). The mean size of a ruptured isolated IIAA was 5.6 cm. The endovascular approach has shown satisfactory outcomes for treatment of isolated IIAA as well as decreased operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative hospital stay compared with the open approach.4,5 A disadvantage of this technique is the inability to reduce compression effects of large aneurysms, with maximum 2-cm shrinkage after endovascular repair.6 An endovascular approach in this patient would not have been feasible owing to the large size of the aneurysm with associated compression effects and his previous surgery, which included ligation of both the right and left common iliac arteries. The endoaneurysmorrhaphy was chosen to treat this recurrence to decompress the aneurysm and because oversewing the individual collateral vessels from within the aneurysm sac obliterates the risk of recurrence. This technique carries a 10% mortality rate3; however, the patient insisted on having his symptoms eliminated.",1488_G_o_o_m,"2

A right hemicolectomy is the recommended procedure in such cases because this procedure avoids any manipulation of the swollen appendix; there is no attempt to reduce the intussuscepted appendix within the abdominal cavity to avoid implantation of mucin-producing cells in the peritoneum, thus leading to pseudomyxoma peritonei.7,8 The literature6,8,11 has shown that laparoscopic surgery for cystadenoma of the appendix is safe provided that care is taken to avoid grasping the appendix and to remove the specimen in a bag with full wound protection.The case patient examined herein underwent a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, and all the necessary precautions were taken (Figure 2). An histopathologic examination of the specimen showed features of low-grade appendicular mucinous cystadenoma. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. A full year has passed since the operation, and the patient is still in good general condition with no evidence of recurrence, as shown by the most recent ultrasonographic and computed tomographic images.Right hemicolectomy specimen showing the terminal ilium and ileocaecal valve (single asterisk), the cecum and ascending colon (double asterisk), the appendix (black arrowheads), and the direction of appendicular intussusception into the cecum (yellow arrowhead).",1494_G_a_n_f,"3  
The patient's gender is moderately relevant due to the fact that the case involves a 32-year-old female who recently gave birth, which may influence the differential diagnosis and management of her abdominal symptoms. Additionally, certain gastrointestinal conditions, including intussusception, can have different prevalence rates and presentations based on gender, making it an important consideration in her clinical situation.","B  
The clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest ileocecal intussusception. The patient has colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and loose stools, which are consistent with this condition. The abdominal ultrasound and CT scan reveal a tubular filling defect in the cecum and lower part of the ascending colon, characteristic of intussusception. The ""donut sign"" observed on ultrasound further supports this diagnosis. Given the age of the patient and the nature of the findings, ileocecal intussusception is the most appropriate diagnosis.",,,,,,

In Western countries, the incidence ranges from 1 in 13 500 persons to 1 in 200 000 persons.1 Cysts are classically divided into 5 subtypes by the Todani modification of the Alonzo-Lej classification. A type 1a cyst consists of common bile duct (CBD) dilatation, a type 1b cyst has focal segmental dilation of the CBD, and a type 1c cyst has diffuse fusiform dilation of the CBD. Type 2 cysts are extrahepatic duct diverticula. Type 3 cysts are intraduodenal or intrapancreatic ductal dilations, also known as choledochoceles. Type 4a cysts are characterized by multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct cysts, whereas type 4b cysts consist of multiple extrahepatic duct cysts only. Finally, type 5 cysts, also known as Caroli disease, are single or multiple intrahepatic biliary cysts.2There are several theories regarding the pathogenesis of choledochal cysts. The most widely accepted is an abnormally high junction between the CBD and the pancreatic duct that creates a long, common channel allowing for pancreatic and biliary reflux into the CBD.3-5 In their retrospective review, Wang et al4 found anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal union in 93.8% of patients with choledochal cysts. A second theory suggests sphincter of Oddi dysfunction resulting in the reflux of bile and pancreatic juice with the subsequent cystic dilatation of the bile duct.6 Common to each model is prolonged biliary inflammation secondary to the reflux of pancreatic juice and bile stasis. This mechanism predisposes the patient to a spectrum of pathology ranging from choledocholithiasis to malignant transformation.1,2,4,5The incidence of carcinogenesis associated with choledochal cysts ranges from 2.5% to 26%.7 The risk of malignancy increases with age, with patients in their ninth decade of life having a 75% chance of malignant conversion.

While lymphoma and pheochromocytoma could also present with some of these symptoms, the specific combination of findings aligns more closely with a pancreatic cystic neoplasm. Rhabdomyosarcoma is less likely in this demographic and with the described symptoms.",,,,,,
1500,"In this case, preoperative computed tomographic imaging of the abdomen revealed a 25 × 22 × 21-cm mixed cystic and solid mass centered within the left retroperitoneum. Because of the retroperitoneal location of the tumor, laboratory evaluation for pheochromocytoma was initiated. The patient had extremely elevated levels of urinary dopamine, plasma metanephrine, and plasma normetanephrine at 1972 µg/24 h (normal, <480 µg/24 h), 7268 pg/mL (normal, <1775 pg/mL), and 22 850 pg/mL (normal, <2548 pg/mL), respectively. The patient was prepared medically for resection with 4 weeks of α-blockade with phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride and 4 days of metyrosine to decrease the catecholamine load. A thoracoabdominal incision and exposure were necessary to completely resect the mass en bloc with the left kidney, spleen, and distal pancreas because of the involvement of the tumor with the vasculature of these organs. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 13 after being weaned from the ventilator and vasopressor support. She received vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria secondary to the incidental splenectomy.Surgical pathology of the 5582-g mass, measuring 24 × 20 × 14 cm, revealed a pheochromocytoma with nodular architecture and multiple areas of vascular invasion. Sheets of tumor cells were observed within the mass where it lost its nodularity. This tumor was classified as malignant because of its size and the extent of invasion, although the pathologic appearance of benign and malignant pheochromocytoma is often identical.Catecholamine-secreting tumors are rare, occurring in only 0.2% of patients with hypertension and 0.5% of patients with hypertension and symptoms suggesting pheochromocytoma.1 The traditional triad of episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia occurs in the minority of patients with pheochromocytoma.2 The most common presenting symptom is hypertension, though 5% to 15% of patients have normal blood pressure, like the patient presented herein. As many as 57.6% of patients with pheochromocytoma may be completely asymptomatic.3 With the increased use of diagnostic imaging for a variety of pathologies, it is becoming more common for pheochromocytoma to be discovered incidentally. Of patients diagnosed with pheochromocytoma, between 20% and 41% were discovered unexpectedly on imaging for other issues.2 Between 5% and 10% of pheochromocytoma tumors are bilateral and up to 15% are extra-adrenal, referred to as catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas.The average age at the time of diagnosis is 47 years. Men and women are affected equally. The average tumor size at the time of diagnosis is 4.9 cm. Tumors less than 10 cm can often be safely resected laparoscopically. Larger tumors such as the one presented herein require an open approach. In this case, a thoracoabdominal incision was used to expose the mass and control the descending aorta.In summary, a pheochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine-secreting tumor. Traditionally, the symptoms associated with pheochromocytoma are episodic headache, sweating, tachycardia, and episodic hypertension, though these are not often present. Up to 41% of pheochromocytoma tumors are discovered incidentally because of the increased use of computed tomographic scan and they should always be included in the differential diagnosis on the discovery of a retroperitoneal mass.",1500_G_a_n_f,"2  
Gender is somewhat relevant in this case as certain abdominal masses, such as cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, can have different prevalence rates and presentations based on gender. Additionally, the patient's gender may influence the approach to diagnosis and treatment, as well as considerations for potential gender-specific risk factors or comorbidities.","A  
The clinical presentation of abdominal distention, early satiety, heat intolerance, and orthostatic hypotension suggests a mass effect in the abdomen. The immobile, nontender abdominal mass seen on examination, along with the imaging findings of a large heterogeneous mass, is consistent with a cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. Pheochromocytoma typically presents with symptoms related to catecholamine release, such as hypertension and palpitations, which are not mentioned here. Lymphoma and rhabdomyosarcoma are less likely given the patient's age and the specific symptoms presented. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis based on the information provided is a cystic neoplasm of the pancreas.",,,,,,

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on postoperative day 5.Appendiceal diverticulum is an uncommon clinical entity that is found in 0.2% to 1.5% of surgical pathologic specimens.1 Diverticula of the vermiform appendix can be congenital (localized in the antimesenteric border and characteristically covered by all layers of the appendix), but, more frequently, it is acquired (in the mesenteric border and lacking the muscularis mucosa), singly or multiply, and can occur along the entire length of the appendix.2 Both types are reported to be more common in males.3Although congenital diverticula pathogenesis remains uncertain (ie, only explained by developmental and genetic abnormalities),4 several mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of acquired appendicular diverticula: (1) increased intraluminal pressure caused by increased muscular activity,5 (2) obstruction of the appendicular lumen, and (3) weak points in the appendicular wall.5,6 Diverticula significantly alter the anatomy of the appendix and increase the possibility of infection.7 Noninflamed diverticula are not thought to be responsible for any symptoms, although they are subject to the same complications as colonic diverticula. An acute inflammatory reaction usually occurs after fecalith impaction within a diverticulum and can be complicated by the formation of an abscess, perforation, a gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pseudomyxoma peritonei, or the formation of an enterocutaneous fistula.3 Because congenital diverticula have the complete structure with all layers of the appendix, they are less susceptible to perforate.7 Another potential complication is appendiceal volvulus or torsion due to band adhesions to adjacent structures.3Owing to their similar clinical presentations, a differential diagnosis between diverticulitis of the appendix and acute appendicitis may be confusing. However, Lipton et al7 noted some consistent differences. The duration of symptoms and the time interval between admission and appendectomy is longer for patients with diverticulitis.7 In addition, patients with appendiceal diverticulitis are older, report previous lower quadrant pain episodes, have fewer gastrointestinal symptoms at presentation, and lack the typical downward progression of initial central abdominal pain moving to the right iliac fossa.7Importantly enough, the incidence of perforation in cases of diverticulitis seems to be 4 times greater than in cases of acute appendicitis.7 A delay in diagnosis and the absence of the muscular layer of the appendix are thought to be contributing factors.Imaging plays a major role in its diagnosis. Ultrasonography, which is usually the first-line imaging technique used to evaluate right lower quadrant pain, shows the diverticula as well-defined, hypoechoic, round or oval-shaped lesions abutting the muscular layer of the appendix.

At laparoscopy, the patient was found to have a gangrenous gallbladder with volvulus; it was untwisted and then successfully removed laparoscopically. Because gallbladder volvulus is associated with a necrotic gallbladder, it should be treated emergently with surgery with no role for expectant or conservative management, even in elderly patients or those with multiple medical comorbidities. Gallbladder volvulus is traditionally associated with elderly women, with a 3:1 female to male ratio. Pathophysiology is associated with torsion around a gallbladder that is often not firmly attached to the liver bed, a so-called floating gallbladder, with a long cystic artery and cystic duct.2 It is easily confused with other causes of peritonitis, particularly acute cholecystitis, and is often only discovered at the time of surgery.3Preoperative diagnosis is difficult owing to the advanced age of most patients, in whom the abdominal examination may be unreliable or subtle signs can be overlooked. Additionally, the classically described signs of floating gallbladder and bull’s-eye or whirl signs are often not seen. Kitagawa et al4 describe the most reliable findings associated with gallbladder volvulus as the following: (1) dilated horizontal gallbladder; (2) thickened gallbladder wall and poor wall enhancement; (3) fluid collection between the gallbladder and the liver, indicating a floating gallbladder; and (4) the presence of a well-enhanced cystic duct located on the right side of the gallbladder. Any of these signs, including the rarely seen whirl sign, are indications for immediate surgical treatment. It is important to distinguish these signs of gallbladder volvulus from classic acute cholecystitis to avoid delay in surgical management, particularly in elderly patients for whom there is little physiological reserve. Laparoscopy can be attempted when gallbladder volvulus is recognized early, but it is often unsuccessful.5 If laparoscopy is attempted, the gallbladder must be untwisted to avoid injury to the common duct, which can be tented up from the volvulus.6,7",1511_G_a_n_f,"1  
Gender has minimal impact in this case as the clinical presentation and diagnosis of acute cholecystitis are not significantly influenced by the patient's gender. While certain conditions may have gender-specific prevalence, the acute nature of the symptoms and the urgency of the situation take precedence over gender considerations.","D  
The clinical presentation of the patient, including localized abdominal pain, tenderness, nausea, and vomiting, along with the ultrasonographic findings that raised concern for acute cholecystitis, strongly supports the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. This condition is characterized by inflammation of the gallbladder, often due to obstruction, which aligns with the symptoms described. The age of the patient and the acute nature of the symptoms further suggest a common and urgent condition like acute cholecystitis rather than the other options listed. Gallbladder volvulus, cancer, and polyps would present differently and are less likely given the acute presentation. Therefore, acute cholecystitis is the most appropriate diagnosis in this case.",,,,,,
1517,"The computed tomographic scan shows marked inflammatory changes involving the gallbladder with air within the lumen (Figure 2). Previous computed tomographic scans had shown multiple large gallstones that were no longer present. There is an intimate association of the gallbladder fundus with the adjacent hepatic flexure of the colon, with a loss of a defined plane between the 2 structures.In the operation room, the gallbladder was taken down in a “dome-down” fashion, and a segment of transverse colon, which included her previous ileocolonic anastomosis from a right-sided hemicolectomy, was excised. Figure 2 shows the resected gross specimen that visually illustrates the presence of a patent fistula that communicates from the fundus of the gallbladder to the colon, as well as the normal ileal and colonic mucosa. Inside the gallbladder lumen, there was a single 1.5 × 1.5-cm gallstone that was the etiology of the fistula.This case illustrates a patient that had developed a cholecystocolonic fistula, a rare complication of cholelithiasis that has a prevalence of about 2% of all biliary tree diseases.1 The patient had a significant medical history that had her on an immunosuppressive regime of chemotherapy and steroids that made her chronically leukopenic and thrombocytopenic. The blood culture that was positive for the bacterium Esakazakii, which is common to the gastrointestinal tract, was the beginning of our search for the source. On a taxonomical note, it is now recognized that E sakazakii actually belongs to the genus Cronobacter.In addition to being susceptible to infections, the patient had long-standing chronic diarrhea that was treated symptomatically. Chronic diarrhea has been reported to be a more specific symptom of cholecystocolonic fistula.2 The mechanism being the aberrant connection alters the normal enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, leading to an increase in bile acid concentration within the colon. These bile acids stimulate the colonic mucosa, leading to the secretion of water and electrolytes with a resultant watery diarrhea.3 In the case of our patient, her diarrhea was markedly worse with the fistula and has since stabilized with transient episodes following chemotherapy treatment.Cholecystocolonic fistulas are the second most common cholecystoenteric fistula after the far more common cholecystoduodenal fistula. Long-standing cholelithiasis is a risk factor for the development of fistulas, as was evident in this patient. Cholelithiasis induces a chronic inflammatory process that, over time, will lead to mechanical erosion through the gallbladder wall and into the wall of the adjacent colon or duodenum. This is a result of the close anatomical proximity of these structures. In the overwhelming majority of cases, this happens between the gallbladder and the duodenum and can lead to a gallstone ileus, whereby a stone becomes lodged at the ileocecal valve.Cholecystocolonic fistulas are so rare that most physicians do not maintain a high index of suspicion for them in clinical cases. This is made even more difficult when you have patients with other comorbidities. Chronic diarrhea in a patient who is receiving chemotherapy is often attributed to the adverse effects of chemotherapy. Often, cholecystocolonic fistulas are not found until the surgeon is actually inside the abdomen, which can lead to the conversion from a laparoscopic to an open surgery, and thus a much more difficult operation than anticipated. This can be alleviated by physicians maintaining a high index of suspicion for cholecystocolonic fistulas in elderly women with chronic diarrhea who still have a gallbladder.",1517_G_o_o_f,"1

Our young patient had no detectable immunodeficiency, which is noteworthy because it stresses that, even in immunocompetent individuals, this pathology should be considered. Finally, the case report once more highlights the paramount importance of obtaining liver abscess fluid cultures in order to search for ongoing or previous infectious foci and to administer the appropriate antibiotics.",1521_G_a_f_m,"2  
Gender is somewhat relevant in this case as certain liver conditions, including inflammatory pseudotumors, can have different prevalence rates between males and females. Additionally, the patient's gender may influence the approach to diagnosis and treatment, considering potential gender-specific risk factors or presentations.","A  
The clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest an inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. The patient exhibits fever, abdominal pain, and a significant inflammatory response, which aligns with the characteristics of an inflammatory pseudotumor. The imaging shows a large, hypodense, multiloculated lesion with necrotic areas, which is consistent with this diagnosis. Other options, such as a hepatic abscess or hydatid cyst, are less likely given the negative serological tests and the specific imaging characteristics. Infected biliary cystadenoma is also less likely due to the absence of biliary symptoms and the nature of the lesion described.",,,,,,
1521,"In this case of group C streptococci–related liver abscess following pharyngitis and scarlet fever, the radiological features were not typical of a simple cyst or of a biliary cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma, given the multiloculated aspect and the absence of contrast enhancement in the septa. The probability of a diagnosis of hydatid cyst was low owing to the patient’s history and the absence of calcifications. Therefore, being suspicious of an infectious etiology, we decided to perform an ultrasonography-guided diagnostic puncture of the hepatic lesion, which yielded a purulent fluid. A percutaneous drain was positioned. A fluid sample was sent to the laboratory for both microbiological and cytological examinations and evidenced necrotic debris in which β-hemolytic group C Streptococcus was isolated. Levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) was administered based on the antibiogram, which also showed that the strain of Streptococcus was resistant to clarithromycin. No primary abdominal infectious foci were apparent on the radiological images. A diagnostic workup was completed with a colonoscopy and an echocardiography, the results of which were negative. Positron emission computed tomography revealed, in addition to an intense enhancement in the liver abscess, a hypermetabolic lymph node located in the anterior mandibular region, ostensibly an issue of the previous pharyngitis. The patient’s course was favorable, and he was discharged from the hospital on day 14, after the removal of the percutaneous drain.Liver abscess is a rare condition with an incidence of 13 to 20 cases per 100 000 population per year.1 Abscesses are more often of a biliary or portal origin. Arterial bacteremia, traumatic injury, and the spread of the abscess by contiguity are more unusual causes. Ten percent to 30% of abscesses are idiopathic. A fever and upper right abdominal pain are the most common symptoms. Jaundice is observed in 25% to 30% of the patients. Aerobic gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria are the most common types of bacteria isolated, accounting for 40% to 60% cases and 40% to 50% of cases, respectively.2 Aerobic gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, α- and β-hemolytic streptococci, and group D streptococci) are isolated in 10% to 20% cases.3 The treatment consists of percutaneous drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, which is adapted according to the antibiogram of the isolates. Surgery is rarely indicated in the case of failure of the percutaneous drain.Scarlet fever is a common pediatric disease, and it is usually caused by pyrogenic toxin-producing group A streptococci. In most cases, it is consequent to an upper respiratory tract infection (“strep throat”). The prognosis is usually good after a timely diagnosis and proper antibiotic therapy, which is effective in reducing the incidence of scarlet fever’s most feared complications (ie, rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis).4 Other complications include osteomyelitis, arthritis, otitis media, hepatitis, meningitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis.5,6β-Hemolytic streptococci of a group other than A and B are known to cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including abscesses,7 more frequently in elderly and immunocompromised patients, but invasive infections are also observed in immunocompetent individuals.8 Occasionally, scarlet fever can be caused by β-hemolytic group C streptococci,9 whose resistance to macrolides in patients with an invasive infection has been previously described.10To the best of our knowledge, a liver abscess caused by group C streptococci following scarlet fever has never been reported. Even if the pharyngeal origin of the Streptococcus could not be formally demonstrated, the pathogenetic link between the previous pharyngitis and the liver abscess in our case is established by the fact that scarlet fever is an exotoxin-mediated disease arising from β-hemolytic streptococcal infection. In this instance, the abscess was most likely the consequence of a transient group C streptococcal bacteremia.

Gender has minimal impact in this case, as the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings are not significantly influenced by the patient's gender. The condition described, a hepatic abscess, can occur in both males and females without notable differences in outcomes or treatment approaches.","B  
The clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest a hepatic abscess. The patient has fever, abdominal pain, and elevated inflammatory markers, which are consistent with an infectious process. The ultrasound and CT findings of a hypodense, multiloculated lesion with necrosis further support the diagnosis of an abscess rather than a tumor or cyst. The negative serological tests for echinococcosis and the absence of other specific markers also make a hydatid cyst less likely. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is a hepatic abscess.",,,,,,
1522,"The multiple incidences of osteolytic lesions indicated a so-called brown tumor. Additional laboratory test results then showed an elevated serum calcium level of 14.72 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25) (range, 8.4-10.4 mg/dL) and intact parathyroid hormone level of 513 pg/mL (to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1) (range, 16-87 pg/mL) and established the diagnosis of pHPT. Carbon 11–labeled methionine positron emission tomography/computed tomography detected a lesion in the neck suspicious for parathyroid adenoma (Figure 2), which was removed subsequently with minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Histopathological analysis showed a typical, 2.5-cm, large upper parathyroid adenoma. Postoperative management included calcium and vitamin D supplementation. At the 12-month follow-up, another radiograph of the right femur and tibia showed significant recalcifications.Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a single-gland parathyroid adenoma in about 90% of patients. Typical symptoms of pHPT are fatigue, weakness, poor concentration, depression, abdominal pain, kidney stones, hypertension, and osteoporosis. Our patient did not mention any of these symptoms.Elevated serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels can indicate pHPT. Indeed, elevated parathyroid hormone levels increase osteoclastic activity in the bone, which induces osteoporosis or in more severe cases, multiple cystic lesions (osteitis fibrosa cystica) or even pathological fractures. An increased osteoclastic activity causes bone resorption with fibrous replacement and giant cells.1 Predominant sites at which brown tumors develop are the jaw, clavicle, ribs, spine, pelvis, and femur.In Europe and the United States, the incidence of brown tumors has now become very low because of calcium screening.2 The clinical picture of pHPT in India, however, often includes skeletal and renal manifestations especially in young patients.3Radiological findings are nonspecific, often seen as multiple cystic lesions on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Lesions extending into the soft tissue, as seen in our patient in the tibia, may suggest malignant bone tumors.4 Since the lesions show an increased uptake on bone scintigraphy, technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scintigraphy, or flourodeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography/computed tomography, they might be falsely diagnosed as bone metastases.5Especially in young patients with HPT, familial HPT, patients with parathyroid carcinoma, or patients with cemento-ossifying fibromas of the mandible and maxilla, a mutation analysis for HRTP2/CDC73 should be considered to identify patients with an autosomal dominant HPT–jaw tumor syndrome.6Treatment of brown tumor depends on successful parathyroidectomy.

The clinical presentation and histopathological findings suggest a giant cell tumor of bone. The presence of spindle cell infiltrates, osteoclastic giant cells, and the aggressive nature of the lesions, along with their location in the distal femur and tibia, aligns with this diagnosis. Aneurysmatic bone cysts typically do not present with such aggressive histological features or the extensive soft tissue involvement seen here.
