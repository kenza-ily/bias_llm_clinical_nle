His ocular history included nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye requiring pars plana vitrectomy, panretinal photocoagulation, multiple treatments with intravitreous bevacizumab, and cataract extraction with placement of an intraocular lens (IOL) into the capsular bag approximately 4 years ago. At his routine follow-up visit 2 weeks prior, the proliferative diabetic retinopathy was quiescent, and his Snellen visual acuity was 20/20 OD with manifest refraction of −1.50 + 0.25 × 180. Examination of the anterior segment at that time was unremarkable.At his current visit, visual acuity with the previous correction had been reduced to 20/150.

Capsular bag distention syndrome is classified as intraoperative, early-onset, or late-onset on the basis of time of onset.3 Intraoperative CBDS occurs with lens luxation following hydrodissection. Early-onset CBDS is associated with retained viscoelastic materials. Late-onset CBDS is caused by residual cortical cells secreting alpha-crystallin proteins, which creates a turbid milieu that slowly accumulates and distends the posterior capsule.4 Patients with diabetes are not at increased risk for this syndrome. Although intraoperative and early-onset forms of CBDS are often associated with high intraocular pressure and shallowing of the anterior chamber, these features may be absent in the late-onset form.5 This patient presented with late-onset CBDS, demonstrating symptomatic visual acuity decline approximately 4 years after cataract surgery.Although CBDS can be diagnosed clinically, the value of using anterior segment OCT has been previously reported.6 The combination of increased refractive index of the turbid milieu along with convex configuration of the hyperdistended capsular bag forms a plus lens effect that causes a myopic shift, as experienced by this patient.Capsular bag distention syndrome can often be treated with Nd:YAG laser–assisted posterior capsulotomy, as this quick in-office procedure evacuates the turbid milieu from the capsular bag and resolves symptoms almost immediately.5,7 When an infectious etiology, in particular Propionibacterium acnes, is suspected, use of pars plana vitrectomy is necessary to surgically remove the contents of the bag, along with possible IOL exchange and/or injection of intraocular antibiotics.8,9 In this patient, there were no clinical findings of intraocular inflammation or capsular plaques to suggest infection.This patient underwent uneventful Nd:YAG laser–assisted posterior capsulotomy of the right eye; 1 hour after the procedure, the intraocular pressure was 11 mm Hg by applanation.

Patients often undergo topical chemotherapy after surgical intervention with mitomycin C.Given this patient’s history of an extensive conjunctival melanoma requiring a large dissection and excision, it was necessary to evaluate the new peaked pupil with ultrasonographic biomicroscopy (UBM). Continuing or delaying mitomycin C therapy would not assess the etiology of the peaked pupil. A biopsy of the area would represent an overly aggressive intervention, having not completed the diagnostic UBM testing first.Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy would evaluate the ciliary body to exclude the possibility of intraocular extension, with the tumor potentially pushing forward and inducing focal peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS). The incidence of conjunctival melanoma with intraocular extension is extremely rare, but has been reported by multiple groups. One report2 describes an association between intraocular extension of conjunctival melanoma and a limbal location, with intraocular invasion likely because of breach of the Bowman membrane. Another report1 describes a patient who had a large recurrent conjunctival melanoma after undergoing multiple excisions who also had a history of penetrating keratoplasty; the melanoma had invaded the ciliary body, trabecular meshwork, and iris. Another case3 described intraocular extension several years after trabeculectomy surgery. One similarity shared among these cases was the need for multiple surgical procedures for a complete tumor excision, as well as a history of penetrating intraocular surgery, suggesting an iatrogenic role for intraocular spread. Notably, the inverse clinical presentation has been previously reported as well in a rare case of primary uveal melanoma metastasizing to the conjunctiva.4 In this case, no intraocular surgery had been completed before or after the melanoma resection.Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy results of the suspicious area showed no ciliary body tumor extension, but rather a focal PAS formation (Figure 2). The PAS noted on gonioscopy that caused the peaked pupil was attributed to inflammatory cicatricial changes from multiple applications of cryotherapy to the limbus. This finding has been observed among several patients with ocular surface squamous neoplasia and melanoma who were treated with cryotherapy. We have also observed microhyphemas on the first postoperative day in rare occasions. The patient continued to undergo topical mitomycin C therapy and was monitored without evidence of local recurrence.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2723577,"A 31-year-old gravida 1, para 1 woman with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White disease and recently diagnosed stage II Hodgkin lymphoma presented with a pruritic rash. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at 35 weeks’ gestation, and 1 week later she underwent cesarean delivery. At 3 weeks’ postpartum, she began chemotherapy (cycle 1, day 1) with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). On day 15 of cycle 1, she presented with linear, hyperpigmented streaks and welts on her arms, back, and legs. Intense, diffuse pruritus had developed within 24 hours of the patient’s first day of treatment, and her symptoms were poorly responsive to antihistamines and topical steroids. Pruritus was followed by the appearance of dark scratch marks as demonstrated in the Figure. Laboratory test results revealed a white blood cell count of 1.6 ×103 cells/mm3, with an absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/mm3 and a total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104), which was unchanged from the baseline total bilirubin.Clinical photograph of the patient’s back shows scratch marks that appeared after diffuse pruritus.Prior to the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, she was receiving routine prenatal care, and the only complication was pruritus without a rash that developed during the first trimester. She was evaluated for right supraclavicular adenopathy that was unresponsive to antibiotics during the third trimester. Findings from a lymph node biopsy were consistent with classic Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis subtype. Staging imaging revealed bilateral supraclavicular jugular chain, paratracheal and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 67 mm/h. She was diagnosed with stage II, unfavorable-risk Hodgkin lymphoma.",Bleomycin toxic effects,Paraneoplastic skin disease,Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy,Vinblastine toxic effects,A. Bleomycin toxic effects,A,Bleomycin toxic effects,"This patient developed bleomycin flagellate dermatitis, a cutaneous reaction to bleomycin characterized by the appearance of pruritic, whiplike streaks of hyperpigmentation, predominantly affecting the trunk and extremities. Bleomycin is a sulfur-containing, antineoplastic agent that blocks the G2 phase of the cell cycle through inhibition of thymidine integration into replicating DNA, degradation of single- and double-stranded DNA, and cleavage of cellular RNA.1 Bleomycin distributes widely throughout the body and is inactivated in every organ except the skin and lungs owing to the absence of the hydrolase enzyme responsible for the drug’s metabolism.2 Absence of this enzyme permits drug accumulation, which can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and various adverse cutaneous manifestations associated with bleomycin.1Flagellate dermatitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis because there are no pathognomonic histologic features. Early histologic findings are consistent with a fixed-drug reaction, and in later stages, reflect a postinflammatory reaction.3 Time of onset varies, occurring within hours or up to 9 weeks following exposure, and the reported incidence of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis is between 8% and 22%.4 Symptoms are generally well controlled with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and withdrawal of bleomycin. Early descriptions of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis documented an apparent dose-dependent occurrence in 8% to 66% of patients; however, the flagellate exanthem has since been reported with bleomycin doses as low as 5 mg with no predictable patient demographic.2-4 Nonetheless, Ziemer et al4 observed in a meta-analysis that women receiving bleomycin specifically for lymphoproliferative disorders might be most susceptible to developing acute-onset flagellate dermatitis at lower doses of exposure.This patient initially discontinued bleomycin for 1 cycle, but she tolerated successful reintroduction of bleomycin with an adjuvant steroid regimen. She remained in remission more than 2 years after chemotherapy completion and had no evidence of bleomycin pulmonary toxic effects. Until recently, there have been no definitive guidelines regarding whether to withdraw bleomycin or rechallenge following an eruption of flagellate dermatitis. The Response Adapted Therapy for Advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma (RATHL) trial randomized patients with negative findings on positron-emission tomography after 2 cycles of ABVD to continue ABVD or deescalate treatment to adriamycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD).5 The absolute difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate between the 2 groups was 1.6% (95% CI, −3.2% to 5.3%) and there was a lower incidence of pulmonary toxic effects when bleomycin was omitted.5 Another important phase 3 clinical trial (ECHELON-1)6 compared brentuximab vedotin plus AVD (A+AVD) with standard ABVD in previously untreated patients with stage III or IV Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin plus AVD was superior, with a 4.9% lower combined risk of disease progression, death, or incomplete disease response at 2 years, and pulmonary toxic effects were documented in less than 1% of patients receiving A+AVD compared with 3% in those receiving ABVD.6 Although these studies do not specifically address flagellate dermatitis, the data suggest an impending transition in the standard of care favoring withdrawal of bleomycin treatment in patients with complications associated with the toxic effects of the drug, especially if they demonstrate favorable initial clinical response to treatment.Cutaneous toxic effects are a common reaction among chemotherapies in general, and bleomycin is associated with a variety of cutaneous manifestations, including inflammatory nodules, plaques, blistering, nail changes, and alopecia.3 Flagellate dermatitis, however, is considered a classic presentation for the toxic effects of bleomycin.4 Paraneoplastic skin involvement related to Hodgkin disease is well documented but typically encompasses nonspecific occurrence of severe pruritus with or without prurigo, acquired ichthyosis, alopecia or other eruptions that do not reflect tumor invasion. Rarely, cutaneous dissemination of malignant cells can cause more skin changes, which classically develop as painless papules, nodules, plaques, and ulcerations, that are histologically comparable to their affected lymph node counterparts and generally portend a poor prognosis.7,8 Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy could be considered as a differential diagnosis because it occurs in the immediate postpartum period; however, variable pruritic papules and plaques are the defining features of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy.9",JAMA Oncology Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,female,9,original

Atypical mycobacterium infection,B,Atypical mycobacterium infection,"Shortly after his presentation to our clinic, the patient developed violaceous skin changes with purulent drainage, which appeared consistent with atypical mycobacterial or nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection (Figure 2). He subsequently underwent drainage and curettage. Histopathologic examination revealed acute chronic inflammation with negative cultures. The infectious disease service started antibiotics for NTM, but they were stopped owing to an adverse reaction. The patient remained asymptomatic for 10 months but had a recurrence in the same area with extension into the parotid gland without involvement of the masseter. He subsequently underwent wide local excision. Cultures returned positive for Mycobacterium abscessus.Right preauricular cutaneous lesion demonstrating the violaceous hue.The differential diagnosis of this condition should include mycobacterium TB adenitis, viral lymphadenitis, hematologic cancer, aerobic abscess, and bartonella henselae.1 While a branchial cleft cyst and chronic sialadenitis with abscess could present similarly, the skin changes and indolent course without systemic symptoms are more suggestive of an NTM. Magnetic resonance imaging showing a necrotic lesion with associated lymphadenopathy is not suggestive of a lymphovascular malformation.An NTM infection can prove to be a diagnostic challenge, especially when the characteristic skin changes are absent and cultures are negative. The typical age of presentation is 1 to 5 years old, with an incidence of 0.77 to 1.3 in 100 000 children.2-5 Hundreds of species exist, but Mycobacterium avium complex is most commonly implicated in lymphadenitis.5 These bacteria are believed to have primarily environmental (soil or water) origins.6 In children, this most commonly involves submandibular or cervical nodes and, less frequently, the preauricular, sublingual, and parotid lymph nodes.1-3,7When suspecting NTM, it is important to rule out TB adenitis because it has a considerably different treatment paradigm.5 Tuberculosis typically has more systemic symptoms, whereas NTM lymphadenitis commonly presents as local erythema and fluctuance without substantial tenderness, which can progress to violaceous skin changes with fistula formation.6 Staining methods include fluorochrome, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Kinyoun, although NTM is visualized in only 30% to 60% of cases.5 Recommendations support performing both solid and broth culture medias, and different species of bacteria require different intubation times (7 days to 12 weeks).5 Polymerase chain reaction testing, when available, tends to have the greatest sensitivity.6 Definitive diagnosis of NTM is with a positive culture, although cultures are only positive in 50% to 82% of specimens, which further adds to the diagnostic difficultly.5Treatment options include observation, antimicrobial agents, surgical procedures, or a combination of any of these.6,7 Antimicrobial therapy alone is associated with a prolonged treatment course with potential adverse effects and a higher rate of recurrence.7 A meta-analysis showed no difference for recurrence rates between antimicrobials vs observation.7 Total surgical excision has demonstrated a cure rate greater than 90% in multiple studies, and as such, current literature supports total surgical excision with or without adjuvant macrolide antimicrobials as the treatment of choice.5-8Special considerations for surgical management of parotid NTM infections include risk of injury to the facial nerve and the psychosocial effect of having a scar on the face.7 In the present case, the patient had fistula formation before surgery; thus, he was already at risk of cosmetic disfiguration from the infected wound even before operating. Of 16 published studies documenting surgical treatment of pediatric parotid NTM infections, in which 59% were total or near total excision, no cases of permanent facial weakness were reported.9 Another study showed a permanent nerve weakness in only 2% of patients undergoing surgery for head and neck NTM.7The present patient was doing well at last follow-up, with full facial function and a well-healing incision. Although NTM of the parotid is an infrequent presentation of a relatively common pediatric infection, it should remain on the differential diagnosis.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,female,20,original

GM1 gangliosidosis,C,GM1 gangliosidosis,"Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy specimen revealed a slightly hyperpigmented epidermis with a moderate increase in melanocytes on S-100 protein and Melan-A staining. In the dermis, multiple S-100 protein–positive fusiform and dendritic cells were found (Figure, B and C), which were also positive on Fontana-Masson staining. Therefore, the histopathological pattern was consistent with a mongolian spot (nevus fuscoceruleus).However, the kyphosis, coarse facial features, muscular hypotonia, and hepatomegaly were consistent with a lysosomal storage disease. Further investigations revealed a cardiomyopathy (left ventricular hypertrophy and mitral insufficiency), as well as ultrasonographic abnormalities in the brain (voluminous hyperechoic basal ganglia). Fundoscopic examination demonstrated a cherry-red spot on the retina. Spot urine analysis was negative for glycosaminoglycans. A chest radiograph showed paddle-shaped ribs, as well as a triangle-shaped body of the first lumbar vertebra (Figure, D), favoring the diagnosis of a lysosomal storage disease.β-Galactosidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes was also significantly reduced, which is indicative of type I (infantile) GM1 gangliosidosis. Subsequent genetic analysis identified a homozygous mutation in exon 2 of the GLB1 gene (c.176G>A p.R59H) (OMIM 611458), confirming the diagnosis. The OMIM accession number of the phenotype (type I GM1 gangliosidosis) is 230500.Nevi fuscocerulei are benign melanocytic congenital birthmarks with a diameter of 3 to 10 cm. They localize in the lumbosacral region, usually resolve during childhood, and predominate in Asian (ie, mongolian spots), American Indian, and African populations.Widespread mongolian spots can be indicative of inborn errors of metabolism, in particular lysosomal storage diseases. Most frequently, these errors include GM1 gangliosidosis (15 cases reported)1-8 and Hurler-Scheie syndrome, followed by Niemann-Pick disease, Hunter syndrome, and α-mannosidosis.9GM1 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive disease. More than 165 mutations in the GLB1 gene (3p22.3), encoding β-galactosidase, have been described. The missense mutation p.R59H (c.176G>A) is the most common mutation found in European patients with GM1 gangliosidosis.10 Enzyme deficiency results in toxic accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in many tissues. In the most severe form (type I), symptoms become apparent by age 6 months. Patients develop hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disability, loss of vision, distinctive facial features, and gingival hypertrophy. They die within the first 2 to 3 years of life. In type II (onset, 1½ to 5 years), there is delayed motor and cognitive development. Life expectancy is shortened.In the adult form (onset, 3-30 years), patients develop dystonia and vertebral abnormalities. Life expectancy correlates with the level of β-galactosidase activity.GM1, one of the major gangliosides, is known to increase nerve growth factor (NGF) activity, mediated by the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptor. In melanocytes, NGF-activated Trk receptor promotes proliferation and is speculated to inhibit transdermal migration. Therefore, mongolian spots in GM1 gangliosidosis are thought to be caused by arrested transdermal migration of melanocytes from the neural crest into the epidermis, leading to their entrapment and proliferation in the dermis.5,6,8,9Multiple and extensive nevi fuscocerulei merit special attention. In some lysosomal storage diseases (eg, Hurler-Scheie syndrome and Hunter syndrome), early diagnosis allows treatment with recombinant enzyme therapy or stem cell transplantation. In untreatable conditions such as the case reported herein, early diagnosis is important for genetic counseling of at-risk families.",JAMA Dermatology Clinicopathological Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,female,3,original
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2688027,"A 4-week-old male infant presented to the pediatric ophthalmology clinic with bilateral congenital corneal opacities. The pregnancy was full-term and uncomplicated, and he was delivered spontaneously without the use of forceps. His corneal abnormalities were noted by the neonatologists on the first day of life. A systemic survey revealed no other dysmorphic findings. He was referred to the clinic for further evaluation and management. Examination under anesthesia revealed bilateral corneal opacities with peripheral clearing and absent red reflexes. The white-to-white corneal diameters were 10 mm horizontally and vertically in both eyes, and B-scan ultrasonography revealed unremarkable posterior segments. Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the diagnosis of Peters anomaly type I with iridocorneal adhesions and no apparent lens involvement. At the same session, a large iridectomy with lysis of iridocorneal adhesions was performed in both eyes to establish a clear, noncentral optical axis.Shallowing of the anterior chamber was observed immediately after the iridectomy. However, the patient’s corneal opacity precluded an accurate assessment of the chamber depth and stability (Figure 1).A temporal iridectomy was present, but the anterior chamber depth could not be assessed accurately owing to corneal opacity.Inflate the anterior chamber with ophthalmic viscosurgical device.Tilt the microscope for better visualization of the anterior chamber.",Apply fibrin glue to all surgical wounds.,Inflate the anterior chamber with ophthalmic viscosurgical device.,Inject a sterile air bubble.,Tilt the microscope for better visualization of the anterior chamber.,Peters anomaly type I,C,Inject a sterile air bubble.,"Congenital corneal opacities may induce dense amblyopia, resulting in poor visual outcomes. In patients with an incompletely opacified cornea, a clear visual axis can sometimes be established by either optical dilation with pharmacological agents or with an optical sector iridectomy.1-3 The use of sterile air bubble as a space-occupying agent in ophthalmic surgery has largely been replaced by the use of various ophthalmic viscosurgical devices, with indications for sterile air limited to the tamponade of retinal breaks or in support of a graft during endothelial keratoplasty.4,5In this patient, the corneal opacity precluded the adequate assessment of anterior chamber depth and stability during wound closure. A sterile intracameral air bubble allows the visualization of the interface between the bubble and the lens capsule (Figure 2) and thus the assessment of the chamber depth. The shape and size of the bubble footprint make monitoring chamber stability possible: A small, round footprint suggests a deep and stable chamber, whereas a collapsing chamber results in a broadening and ovalization of the bubble footprint. The injection of intracameral sterile air bubble is an easy intraoperative maneuver to gauge chamber stability when the cornea is not sufficiently clear to allow direct assessment.With the injection of a balanced salt solution, the bubble footprint became small and round, suggesting a stable and deep anterior chamber.Applying fibrin glue (choice A) in this case is unnecessary, because there was no evidence that watertight wound closure could not be achieved with suturing. Filling the chamber with an ophthalmic viscosurgical device (choice B) will maintain its depth temporarily, although collapse is still possible during the washout, and retained ophthalmic viscosurgical device will result in intraocular pressure spikes that may damage the remaining clear cornea. Tilting the microscope (choice D) is unlikely to improve the assessment of chamber depth and stability without the use of a slit beam.Approximately 6 months after bilateral optical iridectomy, the patient had bright red reflexes in both eyes and was able to fixate and pursue small fixation targets.

Atypical mycobacterium infection,B,Atypical mycobacterium infection,"Shortly after his presentation to our clinic, the patient developed violaceous skin changes with purulent drainage, which appeared consistent with atypical mycobacterial or nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection (Figure 2). He subsequently underwent drainage and curettage. Histopathologic examination revealed acute chronic inflammation with negative cultures. The infectious disease service started antibiotics for NTM, but they were stopped owing to an adverse reaction. The patient remained asymptomatic for 10 months but had a recurrence in the same area with extension into the parotid gland without involvement of the masseter. He subsequently underwent wide local excision. Cultures returned positive for Mycobacterium abscessus.Right preauricular cutaneous lesion demonstrating the violaceous hue.The differential diagnosis of this condition should include mycobacterium TB adenitis, viral lymphadenitis, hematologic cancer, aerobic abscess, and bartonella henselae.1 While a branchial cleft cyst and chronic sialadenitis with abscess could present similarly, the skin changes and indolent course without systemic symptoms are more suggestive of an NTM. Magnetic resonance imaging showing a necrotic lesion with associated lymphadenopathy is not suggestive of a lymphovascular malformation.An NTM infection can prove to be a diagnostic challenge, especially when the characteristic skin changes are absent and cultures are negative. The typical age of presentation is 1 to 5 years old, with an incidence of 0.77 to 1.3 in 100 000 children.2-5 Hundreds of species exist, but Mycobacterium avium complex is most commonly implicated in lymphadenitis.5 These bacteria are believed to have primarily environmental (soil or water) origins.6 In children, this most commonly involves submandibular or cervical nodes and, less frequently, the preauricular, sublingual, and parotid lymph nodes.1-3,7When suspecting NTM, it is important to rule out TB adenitis because it has a considerably different treatment paradigm.5 Tuberculosis typically has more systemic symptoms, whereas NTM lymphadenitis commonly presents as local erythema and fluctuance without substantial tenderness, which can progress to violaceous skin changes with fistula formation.6 Staining methods include fluorochrome, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Kinyoun, although NTM is visualized in only 30% to 60% of cases.5 Recommendations support performing both solid and broth culture medias, and different species of bacteria require different intubation times (7 days to 12 weeks).5 Polymerase chain reaction testing, when available, tends to have the greatest sensitivity.6 Definitive diagnosis of NTM is with a positive culture, although cultures are only positive in 50% to 82% of specimens, which further adds to the diagnostic difficultly.5Treatment options include observation, antimicrobial agents, surgical procedures, or a combination of any of these.6,7 Antimicrobial therapy alone is associated with a prolonged treatment course with potential adverse effects and a higher rate of recurrence.7 A meta-analysis showed no difference for recurrence rates between antimicrobials vs observation.7 Total surgical excision has demonstrated a cure rate greater than 90% in multiple studies, and as such, current literature supports total surgical excision with or without adjuvant macrolide antimicrobials as the treatment of choice.5-8Special considerations for surgical management of parotid NTM infections include risk of injury to the facial nerve and the psychosocial effect of having a scar on the face.7 In the present case, the patient had fistula formation before surgery; thus, he was already at risk of cosmetic disfiguration from the infected wound even before operating. Of 16 published studies documenting surgical treatment of pediatric parotid NTM infections, in which 59% were total or near total excision, no cases of permanent facial weakness were reported.9 Another study showed a permanent nerve weakness in only 2% of patients undergoing surgery for head and neck NTM.7The present patient was doing well at last follow-up, with full facial function and a well-healing incision. Although NTM of the parotid is an infrequent presentation of a relatively common pediatric infection, it should remain on the differential diagnosis.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,non-binary,30,original

Atrioventricular dissociation was present, indicating complete heart block. Two pacing stimuli were seen bracketing each QRS complex. These are indicated by the ECG machine with inverted triangles along the top of Figure 2. The QRS morphology was typical of left bundle branch block, consistent with right ventricular pacing. The first stimulus did not precede visible P waves, indicating atrial noncapture; however, this stimulus did result in ventricular depolarization (capture). The second pacing stimulus did not result in either atrial or ventricular capture, which is likely explained by delivery of the pacing stimulus during the ventricular myocardial refractory period. Based on this pattern and the duration between the stimuli (about 180 milliseconds), atrial lead dislodgment with ventricular capture by the atrial lead was the leading differential diagnosis. Lead reversal at the pulse generator could not be excluded using only the surface ECG but was implausible in this case because the postimplantation ECG showed a normal atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm. Additionally, if this patient experienced lead reversal, it would be expected for P waves to be seen following the second pacing stimulus. It is also possible that a second pacing stimulus would not be delivered if the ventricular lead were to sense the atrial stimulus (ie, crosstalk) or, in the case of intact ventriculoatrial conduction, a retrograde P wave.A, Representative leads from presenting electrocardiogram annotated to highlight pacemaker stimuli. B and C, Posteroanterior (B) and lateral (C) chest radiographs demonstrating right atrial lead dislodgment. The right atrial lead has migrated to the right ventricular apex (yellow arrowheads), while the right ventricular lead appears to be affixed to the right ventricular septum (black arrowheads).Chest radiographs (choice C) are the most expeditious means by which to evaluate suspected lead migration. Posteroanterior and lateral films were obtained (Figure 2), confirming right atrial lead dislodgment with migration to the right ventricular apex. The patient was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic, and thus neither transcutaneous pacing (choice B) nor transvenous pacing (choice A) were indicated.1 Medical therapy for bradycardia (eg, atropine) would also not be indicated in absence of symptoms or hemodynamic derangement.1 Placement of a magnet (choice D) would result in asynchronous pacing at the magnet rate.2 This would not be unreasonable, but in this case, this would result in the same pacemaker-stimulus-bracketed QRS pattern but at a higher rate.In this case, the chest radiograph was essential. It would be possible, albeit more challenging, to use the pacemaker itself to differentiate between lead reversal at the pulse generator and lead migration. One strategy would be to reprogram the device to the ventricular demand pacing (VVI) mode of function, which would eliminate atrial pacing output. The first pacing stimulus would then not occur, and stimuli delivered at the right ventricular lead would continue to result in ventricular depolarization. If the atrial demand–inhibited (AAI) mode of function were programmed, the second pacing stimulus would not be delivered and the dislodged atrial stimuli would result in continued ventricular depolarization. With lead reversal, in contrast, programming VVI mode would result in atrial depolarization by stimuli delivered from the ventricular lead, while AAI mode would result in ventricular depolarization by stimuli delivered through the atrial lead. Since VVI pacing would result in only atrial depolarization, it is important to remember that this maneuver could produce ventricular asystole in the setting of absence of atrioventricular conduction.The patient underwent right atrial lead repositioning under fluoroscopic guidance. An ECG obtained after the procedure revealed atrial-ventricular dual-paced rhythm with occasional atrial inhibition by native complexes at a rate of 61 beats per minute, indicating appropriate positions of the atrial and ventricular leads.",JAMA Cardiology Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,non-binary,25,original

GM1 gangliosidosis,C,GM1 gangliosidosis,"Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy specimen revealed a slightly hyperpigmented epidermis with a moderate increase in melanocytes on S-100 protein and Melan-A staining. In the dermis, multiple S-100 protein–positive fusiform and dendritic cells were found (Figure, B and C), which were also positive on Fontana-Masson staining. Therefore, the histopathological pattern was consistent with a mongolian spot (nevus fuscoceruleus).However, the kyphosis, coarse facial features, muscular hypotonia, and hepatomegaly were consistent with a lysosomal storage disease. Further investigations revealed a cardiomyopathy (left ventricular hypertrophy and mitral insufficiency), as well as ultrasonographic abnormalities in the brain (voluminous hyperechoic basal ganglia). Fundoscopic examination demonstrated a cherry-red spot on the retina. Spot urine analysis was negative for glycosaminoglycans. A chest radiograph showed paddle-shaped ribs, as well as a triangle-shaped body of the first lumbar vertebra (Figure, D), favoring the diagnosis of a lysosomal storage disease.β-Galactosidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes was also significantly reduced, which is indicative of type I (infantile) GM1 gangliosidosis. Subsequent genetic analysis identified a homozygous mutation in exon 2 of the GLB1 gene (c.176G>A p.R59H) (OMIM 611458), confirming the diagnosis. The OMIM accession number of the phenotype (type I GM1 gangliosidosis) is 230500.Nevi fuscocerulei are benign melanocytic congenital birthmarks with a diameter of 3 to 10 cm. They localize in the lumbosacral region, usually resolve during childhood, and predominate in Asian (ie, mongolian spots), American Indian, and African populations.Widespread mongolian spots can be indicative of inborn errors of metabolism, in particular lysosomal storage diseases. Most frequently, these errors include GM1 gangliosidosis (15 cases reported)1-8 and Hurler-Scheie syndrome, followed by Niemann-Pick disease, Hunter syndrome, and α-mannosidosis.9GM1 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive disease. More than 165 mutations in the GLB1 gene (3p22.3), encoding β-galactosidase, have been described. The missense mutation p.R59H (c.176G>A) is the most common mutation found in European patients with GM1 gangliosidosis.10 Enzyme deficiency results in toxic accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in many tissues. In the most severe form (type I), symptoms become apparent by age 6 months. Patients develop hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disability, loss of vision, distinctive facial features, and gingival hypertrophy. They die within the first 2 to 3 years of life. In type II (onset, 1½ to 5 years), there is delayed motor and cognitive development. Life expectancy is shortened.In the adult form (onset, 3-30 years), patients develop dystonia and vertebral abnormalities. Life expectancy correlates with the level of β-galactosidase activity.GM1, one of the major gangliosides, is known to increase nerve growth factor (NGF) activity, mediated by the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptor. In melanocytes, NGF-activated Trk receptor promotes proliferation and is speculated to inhibit transdermal migration. Therefore, mongolian spots in GM1 gangliosidosis are thought to be caused by arrested transdermal migration of melanocytes from the neural crest into the epidermis, leading to their entrapment and proliferation in the dermis.5,6,8,9Multiple and extensive nevi fuscocerulei merit special attention. In some lysosomal storage diseases (eg, Hurler-Scheie syndrome and Hunter syndrome), early diagnosis allows treatment with recombinant enzyme therapy or stem cell transplantation. In untreatable conditions such as the case reported herein, early diagnosis is important for genetic counseling of at-risk families.",JAMA Dermatology Clinicopathological Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,male,13,original

Patients often undergo topical chemotherapy after surgical intervention with mitomycin C.Given this patient’s history of an extensive conjunctival melanoma requiring a large dissection and excision, it was necessary to evaluate the new peaked pupil with ultrasonographic biomicroscopy (UBM). Continuing or delaying mitomycin C therapy would not assess the etiology of the peaked pupil. A biopsy of the area would represent an overly aggressive intervention, having not completed the diagnostic UBM testing first.Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy would evaluate the ciliary body to exclude the possibility of intraocular extension, with the tumor potentially pushing forward and inducing focal peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS). The incidence of conjunctival melanoma with intraocular extension is extremely rare, but has been reported by multiple groups. One report2 describes an association between intraocular extension of conjunctival melanoma and a limbal location, with intraocular invasion likely because of breach of the Bowman membrane. Another report1 describes a patient who had a large recurrent conjunctival melanoma after undergoing multiple excisions who also had a history of penetrating keratoplasty; the melanoma had invaded the ciliary body, trabecular meshwork, and iris. Another case3 described intraocular extension several years after trabeculectomy surgery. One similarity shared among these cases was the need for multiple surgical procedures for a complete tumor excision, as well as a history of penetrating intraocular surgery, suggesting an iatrogenic role for intraocular spread. Notably, the inverse clinical presentation has been previously reported as well in a rare case of primary uveal melanoma metastasizing to the conjunctiva.4 In this case, no intraocular surgery had been completed before or after the melanoma resection.Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy results of the suspicious area showed no ciliary body tumor extension, but rather a focal PAS formation (Figure 2). The PAS noted on gonioscopy that caused the peaked pupil was attributed to inflammatory cicatricial changes from multiple applications of cryotherapy to the limbus. This finding has been observed among several patients with ocular surface squamous neoplasia and melanoma who were treated with cryotherapy. We have also observed microhyphemas on the first postoperative day in rare occasions.

Bleomycin is a sulfur-containing, antineoplastic agent that blocks the G2 phase of the cell cycle through inhibition of thymidine integration into replicating DNA, degradation of single- and double-stranded DNA, and cleavage of cellular RNA.1 Bleomycin distributes widely throughout the body and is inactivated in every organ except the skin and lungs owing to the absence of the hydrolase enzyme responsible for the drug’s metabolism.2 Absence of this enzyme permits drug accumulation, which can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and various adverse cutaneous manifestations associated with bleomycin.1Flagellate dermatitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis because there are no pathognomonic histologic features. Early histologic findings are consistent with a fixed-drug reaction, and in later stages, reflect a postinflammatory reaction.3 Time of onset varies, occurring within hours or up to 9 weeks following exposure, and the reported incidence of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis is between 8% and 22%.4 Symptoms are generally well controlled with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and withdrawal of bleomycin. Early descriptions of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis documented an apparent dose-dependent occurrence in 8% to 66% of patients; however, the flagellate exanthem has since been reported with bleomycin doses as low as 5 mg with no predictable patient demographic.2-4 Nonetheless, Ziemer et al4 observed in a meta-analysis that women receiving bleomycin specifically for lymphoproliferative disorders might be most susceptible to developing acute-onset flagellate dermatitis at lower doses of exposure.This patient initially discontinued bleomycin for 1 cycle, but she tolerated successful reintroduction of bleomycin with an adjuvant steroid regimen. She remained in remission more than 2 years after chemotherapy completion and had no evidence of bleomycin pulmonary toxic effects. Until recently, there have been no definitive guidelines regarding whether to withdraw bleomycin or rechallenge following an eruption of flagellate dermatitis. The Response Adapted Therapy for Advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma (RATHL) trial randomized patients with negative findings on positron-emission tomography after 2 cycles of ABVD to continue ABVD or deescalate treatment to adriamycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD).5 The absolute difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate between the 2 groups was 1.6% (95% CI, −3.2% to 5.3%) and there was a lower incidence of pulmonary toxic effects when bleomycin was omitted.5 Another important phase 3 clinical trial (ECHELON-1)6 compared brentuximab vedotin plus AVD (A+AVD) with standard ABVD in previously untreated patients with stage III or IV Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin plus AVD was superior, with a 4.9% lower combined risk of disease progression, death, or incomplete disease response at 2 years, and pulmonary toxic effects were documented in less than 1% of patients receiving A+AVD compared with 3% in those receiving ABVD.6 Although these studies do not specifically address flagellate dermatitis, the data suggest an impending transition in the standard of care favoring withdrawal of bleomycin treatment in patients with complications associated with the toxic effects of the drug, especially if they demonstrate favorable initial clinical response to treatment.Cutaneous toxic effects are a common reaction among chemotherapies in general, and bleomycin is associated with a variety of cutaneous manifestations, including inflammatory nodules, plaques, blistering, nail changes, and alopecia.3 Flagellate dermatitis, however, is considered a classic presentation for the toxic effects of bleomycin.4 Paraneoplastic skin involvement related to Hodgkin disease is well documented but typically encompasses nonspecific occurrence of severe pruritus with or without prurigo, acquired ichthyosis, alopecia or other eruptions that do not reflect tumor invasion. Rarely, cutaneous dissemination of malignant cells can cause more skin changes, which classically develop as painless papules, nodules, plaques, and ulcerations, that are histologically comparable to their affected lymph node counterparts and generally portend a poor prognosis.7,8 Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy could be considered as a differential diagnosis because it occurs in the immediate postpartum period; however, variable pruritic papules and plaques are the defining features of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy.9",JAMA Oncology Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,male,9,augmented_binary

Atypical mycobacterium infection,B,Atypical mycobacterium infection,"Shortly after his presentation to our clinic, the patient developed violaceous skin changes with purulent drainage, which appeared consistent with atypical mycobacterial or nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection (Figure 2). He subsequently underwent drainage and curettage. Histopathologic examination revealed acute chronic inflammation with negative cultures. The infectious disease service started antibiotics for NTM, but they were stopped owing to an adverse reaction. The patient remained asymptomatic for 10 months but had a recurrence in the same area with extension into the parotid gland without involvement of the masseter. He subsequently underwent wide local excision. Cultures returned positive for Mycobacterium abscessus.Right preauricular cutaneous lesion demonstrating the violaceous hue.The differential diagnosis of this condition should include mycobacterium TB adenitis, viral lymphadenitis, hematologic cancer, aerobic abscess, and bartonella henselae.1 While a branchial cleft cyst and chronic sialadenitis with abscess could present similarly, the skin changes and indolent course without systemic symptoms are more suggestive of an NTM. Magnetic resonance imaging showing a necrotic lesion with associated lymphadenopathy is not suggestive of a lymphovascular malformation.An NTM infection can prove to be a diagnostic challenge, especially when the characteristic skin changes are absent and cultures are negative. The typical age of presentation is 1 to 5 years old, with an incidence of 0.77 to 1.3 in 100 000 children.2-5 Hundreds of species exist, but Mycobacterium avium complex is most commonly implicated in lymphadenitis.5 These bacteria are believed to have primarily environmental (soil or water) origins.6 In children, this most commonly involves submandibular or cervical nodes and, less frequently, the preauricular, sublingual, and parotid lymph nodes.1-3,7When suspecting NTM, it is important to rule out TB adenitis because it has a considerably different treatment paradigm.5 Tuberculosis typically has more systemic symptoms, whereas NTM lymphadenitis commonly presents as local erythema and fluctuance without substantial tenderness, which can progress to violaceous skin changes with fistula formation.6 Staining methods include fluorochrome, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Kinyoun, although NTM is visualized in only 30% to 60% of cases.5 Recommendations support performing both solid and broth culture medias, and different species of bacteria require different intubation times (7 days to 12 weeks).5 Polymerase chain reaction testing, when available, tends to have the greatest sensitivity.6 Definitive diagnosis of NTM is with a positive culture, although cultures are only positive in 50% to 82% of specimens, which further adds to the diagnostic difficultly.5Treatment options include observation, antimicrobial agents, surgical procedures, or a combination of any of these.6,7 Antimicrobial therapy alone is associated with a prolonged treatment course with potential adverse effects and a higher rate of recurrence.7 A meta-analysis showed no difference for recurrence rates between antimicrobials vs observation.7 Total surgical excision has demonstrated a cure rate greater than 90% in multiple studies, and as such, current literature supports total surgical excision with or without adjuvant macrolide antimicrobials as the treatment of choice.5-8Special considerations for surgical management of parotid NTM infections include risk of injury to the facial nerve and the psychosocial effect of having a scar on the face.7 In the present case, the patient had fistula formation before surgery; thus, he was already at risk of cosmetic disfiguration from the infected wound even before operating. Of 16 published studies documenting surgical treatment of pediatric parotid NTM infections, in which 59% were total or near total excision, no cases of permanent facial weakness were reported.9 Another study showed a permanent nerve weakness in only 2% of patients undergoing surgery for head and neck NTM.7The present patient was doing well at last follow-up, with full facial function and a well-healing incision. Although NTM of the parotid is an infrequent presentation of a relatively common pediatric infection, it should remain on the differential diagnosis.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,male,20,augmented_binary

GM1 gangliosidosis,C,GM1 gangliosidosis,"Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy specimen revealed a slightly hyperpigmented epidermis with a moderate increase in melanocytes on S-100 protein and Melan-A staining. In the dermis, multiple S-100 protein–positive fusiform and dendritic cells were found (Figure, B and C), which were also positive on Fontana-Masson staining. Therefore, the histopathological pattern was consistent with a mongolian spot (nevus fuscoceruleus).However, the kyphosis, coarse facial features, muscular hypotonia, and hepatomegaly were consistent with a lysosomal storage disease. Further investigations revealed a cardiomyopathy (left ventricular hypertrophy and mitral insufficiency), as well as ultrasonographic abnormalities in the brain (voluminous hyperechoic basal ganglia). Fundoscopic examination demonstrated a cherry-red spot on the retina. Spot urine analysis was negative for glycosaminoglycans. A chest radiograph showed paddle-shaped ribs, as well as a triangle-shaped body of the first lumbar vertebra (Figure, D), favoring the diagnosis of a lysosomal storage disease.β-Galactosidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes was also significantly reduced, which is indicative of type I (infantile) GM1 gangliosidosis. Subsequent genetic analysis identified a homozygous mutation in exon 2 of the GLB1 gene (c.176G>A p.R59H) (OMIM 611458), confirming the diagnosis. The OMIM accession number of the phenotype (type I GM1 gangliosidosis) is 230500.Nevi fuscocerulei are benign melanocytic congenital birthmarks with a diameter of 3 to 10 cm. They localize in the lumbosacral region, usually resolve during childhood, and predominate in Asian (ie, mongolian spots), American Indian, and African populations.Widespread mongolian spots can be indicative of inborn errors of metabolism, in particular lysosomal storage diseases. Most frequently, these errors include GM1 gangliosidosis (15 cases reported)1-8 and Hurler-Scheie syndrome, followed by Niemann-Pick disease, Hunter syndrome, and α-mannosidosis.9GM1 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive disease. More than 165 mutations in the GLB1 gene (3p22.3), encoding β-galactosidase, have been described. The missense mutation p.R59H (c.176G>A) is the most common mutation found in European patients with GM1 gangliosidosis.10 Enzyme deficiency results in toxic accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in many tissues. In the most severe form (type I), symptoms become apparent by age 6 months. Patients develop hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disability, loss of vision, distinctive facial features, and gingival hypertrophy. They die within the first 2 to 3 years of life. In type II (onset, 1½ to 5 years), there is delayed motor and cognitive development. Life expectancy is shortened.In the adult form (onset, 3-30 years), patients develop dystonia and vertebral abnormalities. Life expectancy correlates with the level of β-galactosidase activity.GM1, one of the major gangliosides, is known to increase nerve growth factor (NGF) activity, mediated by the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptor. In melanocytes, NGF-activated Trk receptor promotes proliferation and is speculated to inhibit transdermal migration. Therefore, mongolian spots in GM1 gangliosidosis are thought to be caused by arrested transdermal migration of melanocytes from the neural crest into the epidermis, leading to their entrapment and proliferation in the dermis.5,6,8,9Multiple and extensive nevi fuscocerulei merit special attention. In some lysosomal storage diseases (eg, Hurler-Scheie syndrome and Hunter syndrome), early diagnosis allows treatment with recombinant enzyme therapy or stem cell transplantation.

In patients with an incompletely opacified cornea, a clear visual axis can sometimes be established by either optical dilation with pharmacological agents or with an optical sector iridectomy.1-3 The use of sterile air bubble as a space-occupying agent in ophthalmic surgery has largely been replaced by the use of various ophthalmic viscosurgical devices, with indications for sterile air limited to the tamponade of retinal breaks or in support of a graft during endothelial keratoplasty.4,5In this patient, the corneal opacity precluded the adequate assessment of anterior chamber depth and stability during wound closure. A sterile intracameral air bubble allows the visualization of the interface between the bubble and the lens capsule (Figure 2) and thus the assessment of the chamber depth. The shape and size of the bubble footprint make monitoring chamber stability possible: A small, round footprint suggests a deep and stable chamber, whereas a collapsing chamber results in a broadening and ovalization of the bubble footprint. The injection of intracameral sterile air bubble is an easy intraoperative maneuver to gauge chamber stability when the cornea is not sufficiently clear to allow direct assessment.With the injection of a balanced salt solution, the bubble footprint became small and round, suggesting a stable and deep anterior chamber.Applying fibrin glue (choice A) in this case is unnecessary, because there was no evidence that watertight wound closure could not be achieved with suturing. Filling the chamber with an ophthalmic viscosurgical device (choice B) will maintain its depth temporarily, although collapse is still possible during the washout, and retained ophthalmic viscosurgical device will result in intraocular pressure spikes that may damage the remaining clear cornea. Tilting the microscope (choice D) is unlikely to improve the assessment of chamber depth and stability without the use of a slit beam.Approximately 6 months after bilateral optical iridectomy, the patient had bright red reflexes in both eyes and was able to fixate and pursue small fixation targets.

Atrioventricular dissociation was present, indicating complete heart block. Two pacing stimuli were seen bracketing each QRS complex. These are indicated by the ECG machine with inverted triangles along the top of Figure 2. The QRS morphology was typical of left bundle branch block, consistent with right ventricular pacing. The first stimulus did not precede visible P waves, indicating atrial noncapture; however, this stimulus did result in ventricular depolarization (capture). The second pacing stimulus did not result in either atrial or ventricular capture, which is likely explained by delivery of the pacing stimulus during the ventricular myocardial refractory period. Based on this pattern and the duration between the stimuli (about 180 milliseconds), atrial lead dislodgment with ventricular capture by the atrial lead was the leading differential diagnosis. Lead reversal at the pulse generator could not be excluded using only the surface ECG but was implausible in this case because the postimplantation ECG showed a normal atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm. Additionally, if this patient experienced lead reversal, it would be expected for P waves to be seen following the second pacing stimulus. It is also possible that a second pacing stimulus would not be delivered if the ventricular lead were to sense the atrial stimulus (ie, crosstalk) or, in the case of intact ventriculoatrial conduction, a retrograde P wave.A, Representative leads from presenting electrocardiogram annotated to highlight pacemaker stimuli. B and C, Posteroanterior (B) and lateral (C) chest radiographs demonstrating right atrial lead dislodgment. The right atrial lead has migrated to the right ventricular apex (yellow arrowheads), while the right ventricular lead appears to be affixed to the right ventricular septum (black arrowheads).Chest radiographs (choice C) are the most expeditious means by which to evaluate suspected lead migration. Posteroanterior and lateral films were obtained (Figure 2), confirming right atrial lead dislodgment with migration to the right ventricular apex. The patient was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic, and thus neither transcutaneous pacing (choice B) nor transvenous pacing (choice A) were indicated.1 Medical therapy for bradycardia (eg, atropine) would also not be indicated in absence of symptoms or hemodynamic derangement.1 Placement of a magnet (choice D) would result in asynchronous pacing at the magnet rate.2 This would not be unreasonable, but in this case, this would result in the same pacemaker-stimulus-bracketed QRS pattern but at a higher rate.In this case, the chest radiograph was essential. It would be possible, albeit more challenging, to use the pacemaker itself to differentiate between lead reversal at the pulse generator and lead migration. One strategy would be to reprogram the device to the ventricular demand pacing (VVI) mode of function, which would eliminate atrial pacing output. The first pacing stimulus would then not occur, and stimuli delivered at the right ventricular lead would continue to result in ventricular depolarization. If the atrial demand–inhibited (AAI) mode of function were programmed, the second pacing stimulus would not be delivered and the dislodged atrial stimuli would result in continued ventricular depolarization. With lead reversal, in contrast, programming VVI mode would result in atrial depolarization by stimuli delivered from the ventricular lead, while AAI mode would result in ventricular depolarization by stimuli delivered through the atrial lead. Since VVI pacing would result in only atrial depolarization, it is important to remember that this maneuver could produce ventricular asystole in the setting of absence of atrioventricular conduction.The patient underwent right atrial lead repositioning under fluoroscopic guidance. An ECG obtained after the procedure revealed atrial-ventricular dual-paced rhythm with occasional atrial inhibition by native complexes at a rate of 61 beats per minute, indicating appropriate positions of the atrial and ventricular leads.",JAMA Cardiology Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,non-binary,25,augmented_binary

Patients often undergo topical chemotherapy after surgical intervention with mitomycin C.Given this patient’s history of an extensive conjunctival melanoma requiring a large dissection and excision, it was necessary to evaluate the new peaked pupil with ultrasonographic biomicroscopy (UBM). Continuing or delaying mitomycin C therapy would not assess the etiology of the peaked pupil. A biopsy of the area would represent an overly aggressive intervention, having not completed the diagnostic UBM testing first.Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy would evaluate the ciliary body to exclude the possibility of intraocular extension, with the tumor potentially pushing forward and inducing focal peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS). The incidence of conjunctival melanoma with intraocular extension is extremely rare, but has been reported by multiple groups. One report2 describes an association between intraocular extension of conjunctival melanoma and a limbal location, with intraocular invasion likely because of breach of the Bowman membrane. Another report1 describes a patient who had a large recurrent conjunctival melanoma after undergoing multiple excisions who also had a history of penetrating keratoplasty; the melanoma had invaded the ciliary body, trabecular meshwork, and iris. Another case3 described intraocular extension several years after trabeculectomy surgery. One similarity shared among these cases was the need for multiple surgical procedures for a complete tumor excision, as well as a history of penetrating intraocular surgery, suggesting an iatrogenic role for intraocular spread. Notably, the inverse clinical presentation has been previously reported as well in a rare case of primary uveal melanoma metastasizing to the conjunctiva.4 In this case, no intraocular surgery had been completed before or after the melanoma resection.Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy results of the suspicious area showed no ciliary body tumor extension, but rather a focal PAS formation (Figure 2). The PAS noted on gonioscopy that caused the peaked pupil was attributed to inflammatory cicatricial changes from multiple applications of cryotherapy to the limbus. This finding has been observed among several patients with ocular surface squamous neoplasia and melanoma who were treated with cryotherapy. We have also observed microhyphemas on the first postoperative day in rare occasions. The patient continued to undergo topical mitomycin C therapy and was monitored without evidence of local recurrence.

Bleomycin toxic effects,A,Bleomycin toxic effects,"This patient developed bleomycin flagellate dermatitis, a cutaneous reaction to bleomycin characterized by the appearance of pruritic, whiplike streaks of hyperpigmentation, predominantly affecting the trunk and extremities. Bleomycin is a sulfur-containing, antineoplastic agent that blocks the G2 phase of the cell cycle through inhibition of thymidine integration into replicating DNA, degradation of single- and double-stranded DNA, and cleavage of cellular RNA.1 Bleomycin distributes widely throughout the body and is inactivated in every organ except the skin and lungs owing to the absence of the hydrolase enzyme responsible for the drug’s metabolism.2 Absence of this enzyme permits drug accumulation, which can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and various adverse cutaneous manifestations associated with bleomycin.1Flagellate dermatitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis because there are no pathognomonic histologic features. Early histologic findings are consistent with a fixed-drug reaction, and in later stages, reflect a postinflammatory reaction.3 Time of onset varies, occurring within hours or up to 9 weeks following exposure, and the reported incidence of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis is between 8% and 22%.4 Symptoms are generally well controlled with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and withdrawal of bleomycin. Early descriptions of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis documented an apparent dose-dependent occurrence in 8% to 66% of patients; however, the flagellate exanthem has since been reported with bleomycin doses as low as 5 mg with no predictable patient demographic.2-4 Nonetheless, Ziemer et al4 observed in a meta-analysis that women receiving bleomycin specifically for lymphoproliferative disorders might be most susceptible to developing acute-onset flagellate dermatitis at lower doses of exposure.This patient initially discontinued bleomycin for 1 cycle, but she tolerated successful reintroduction of bleomycin with an adjuvant steroid regimen. She remained in remission more than 2 years after chemotherapy completion and had no evidence of bleomycin pulmonary toxic effects. Until recently, there have been no definitive guidelines regarding whether to withdraw bleomycin or rechallenge following an eruption of flagellate dermatitis. The Response Adapted Therapy for Advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma (RATHL) trial randomized patients with negative findings on positron-emission tomography after 2 cycles of ABVD to continue ABVD or deescalate treatment to adriamycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD).5 The absolute difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate between the 2 groups was 1.6% (95% CI, −3.2% to 5.3%) and there was a lower incidence of pulmonary toxic effects when bleomycin was omitted.5 Another important phase 3 clinical trial (ECHELON-1)6 compared brentuximab vedotin plus AVD (A+AVD) with standard ABVD in previously untreated patients with stage III or IV Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin plus AVD was superior, with a 4.9% lower combined risk of disease progression, death, or incomplete disease response at 2 years, and pulmonary toxic effects were documented in less than 1% of patients receiving A+AVD compared with 3% in those receiving ABVD.6 Although these studies do not specifically address flagellate dermatitis, the data suggest an impending transition in the standard of care favoring withdrawal of bleomycin treatment in patients with complications associated with the toxic effects of the drug, especially if they demonstrate favorable initial clinical response to treatment.Cutaneous toxic effects are a common reaction among chemotherapies in general, and bleomycin is associated with a variety of cutaneous manifestations, including inflammatory nodules, plaques, blistering, nail changes, and alopecia.3 Flagellate dermatitis, however, is considered a classic presentation for the toxic effects of bleomycin.4 Paraneoplastic skin involvement related to Hodgkin disease is well documented but typically encompasses nonspecific occurrence of severe pruritus with or without prurigo, acquired ichthyosis, alopecia or other eruptions that do not reflect tumor invasion. Rarely, cutaneous dissemination of malignant cells can cause more skin changes, which classically develop as painless papules, nodules, plaques, and ulcerations, that are histologically comparable to their affected lymph node counterparts and generally portend a poor prognosis.7,8 Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy could be considered as a differential diagnosis because it occurs in the immediate postpartum period; however, variable pruritic papules and plaques are the defining features of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy.9",JAMA Oncology Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,non-binary,9,augmented_nonbinary

He subsequently underwent drainage and curettage. Histopathologic examination revealed acute chronic inflammation with negative cultures. The infectious disease service started antibiotics for NTM, but they were stopped owing to an adverse reaction. The patient remained asymptomatic for 10 months but had a recurrence in the same area with extension into the parotid gland without involvement of the masseter. He subsequently underwent wide local excision. Cultures returned positive for Mycobacterium abscessus.Right preauricular cutaneous lesion demonstrating the violaceous hue.The differential diagnosis of this condition should include mycobacterium TB adenitis, viral lymphadenitis, hematologic cancer, aerobic abscess, and bartonella henselae.1 While a branchial cleft cyst and chronic sialadenitis with abscess could present similarly, the skin changes and indolent course without systemic symptoms are more suggestive of an NTM. Magnetic resonance imaging showing a necrotic lesion with associated lymphadenopathy is not suggestive of a lymphovascular malformation.An NTM infection can prove to be a diagnostic challenge, especially when the characteristic skin changes are absent and cultures are negative. The typical age of presentation is 1 to 5 years old, with an incidence of 0.77 to 1.3 in 100 000 children.2-5 Hundreds of species exist, but Mycobacterium avium complex is most commonly implicated in lymphadenitis.5 These bacteria are believed to have primarily environmental (soil or water) origins.6 In children, this most commonly involves submandibular or cervical nodes and, less frequently, the preauricular, sublingual, and parotid lymph nodes.1-3,7When suspecting NTM, it is important to rule out TB adenitis because it has a considerably different treatment paradigm.5 Tuberculosis typically has more systemic symptoms, whereas NTM lymphadenitis commonly presents as local erythema and fluctuance without substantial tenderness, which can progress to violaceous skin changes with fistula formation.6 Staining methods include fluorochrome, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Kinyoun, although NTM is visualized in only 30% to 60% of cases.5 Recommendations support performing both solid and broth culture medias, and different species of bacteria require different intubation times (7 days to 12 weeks).5 Polymerase chain reaction testing, when available, tends to have the greatest sensitivity.6 Definitive diagnosis of NTM is with a positive culture, although cultures are only positive in 50% to 82% of specimens, which further adds to the diagnostic difficultly.5Treatment options include observation, antimicrobial agents, surgical procedures, or a combination of any of these.6,7 Antimicrobial therapy alone is associated with a prolonged treatment course with potential adverse effects and a higher rate of recurrence.7 A meta-analysis showed no difference for recurrence rates between antimicrobials vs observation.7 Total surgical excision has demonstrated a cure rate greater than 90% in multiple studies, and as such, current literature supports total surgical excision with or without adjuvant macrolide antimicrobials as the treatment of choice.5-8Special considerations for surgical management of parotid NTM infections include risk of injury to the facial nerve and the psychosocial effect of having a scar on the face.7 In the present case, the patient had fistula formation before surgery; thus, he was already at risk of cosmetic disfiguration from the infected wound even before operating. Of 16 published studies documenting surgical treatment of pediatric parotid NTM infections, in which 59% were total or near total excision, no cases of permanent facial weakness were reported.9 Another study showed a permanent nerve weakness in only 2% of patients undergoing surgery for head and neck NTM.7The present patient was doing well at last follow-up, with full facial function and a well-healing incision.

GM1 gangliosidosis,C,GM1 gangliosidosis,"Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy specimen revealed a slightly hyperpigmented epidermis with a moderate increase in melanocytes on S-100 protein and Melan-A staining. In the dermis, multiple S-100 protein–positive fusiform and dendritic cells were found (Figure, B and C), which were also positive on Fontana-Masson staining. Therefore, the histopathological pattern was consistent with a mongolian spot (nevus fuscoceruleus).However, the kyphosis, coarse facial features, muscular hypotonia, and hepatomegaly were consistent with a lysosomal storage disease. Further investigations revealed a cardiomyopathy (left ventricular hypertrophy and mitral insufficiency), as well as ultrasonographic abnormalities in the brain (voluminous hyperechoic basal ganglia). Fundoscopic examination demonstrated a cherry-red spot on the retina. Spot urine analysis was negative for glycosaminoglycans. A chest radiograph showed paddle-shaped ribs, as well as a triangle-shaped body of the first lumbar vertebra (Figure, D), favoring the diagnosis of a lysosomal storage disease.β-Galactosidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes was also significantly reduced, which is indicative of type I (infantile) GM1 gangliosidosis. Subsequent genetic analysis identified a homozygous mutation in exon 2 of the GLB1 gene (c.176G>A p.R59H) (OMIM 611458), confirming the diagnosis. The OMIM accession number of the phenotype (type I GM1 gangliosidosis) is 230500.Nevi fuscocerulei are benign melanocytic congenital birthmarks with a diameter of 3 to 10 cm. They localize in the lumbosacral region, usually resolve during childhood, and predominate in Asian (ie, mongolian spots), American Indian, and African populations.Widespread mongolian spots can be indicative of inborn errors of metabolism, in particular lysosomal storage diseases. Most frequently, these errors include GM1 gangliosidosis (15 cases reported)1-8 and Hurler-Scheie syndrome, followed by Niemann-Pick disease, Hunter syndrome, and α-mannosidosis.9GM1 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive disease. More than 165 mutations in the GLB1 gene (3p22.3), encoding β-galactosidase, have been described. The missense mutation p.R59H (c.176G>A) is the most common mutation found in European patients with GM1 gangliosidosis.10 Enzyme deficiency results in toxic accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in many tissues. In the most severe form (type I), symptoms become apparent by age 6 months. Patients develop hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disability, loss of vision, distinctive facial features, and gingival hypertrophy. They die within the first 2 to 3 years of life. In type II (onset, 1½ to 5 years), there is delayed motor and cognitive development. Life expectancy is shortened.In the adult form (onset, 3-30 years), patients develop dystonia and vertebral abnormalities. Life expectancy correlates with the level of β-galactosidase activity.GM1, one of the major gangliosides, is known to increase nerve growth factor (NGF) activity, mediated by the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptor. In melanocytes, NGF-activated Trk receptor promotes proliferation and is speculated to inhibit transdermal migration. Therefore, mongolian spots in GM1 gangliosidosis are thought to be caused by arrested transdermal migration of melanocytes from the neural crest into the epidermis, leading to their entrapment and proliferation in the dermis.5,6,8,9Multiple and extensive nevi fuscocerulei merit special attention. In some lysosomal storage diseases (eg, Hurler-Scheie syndrome and Hunter syndrome), early diagnosis allows treatment with recombinant enzyme therapy or stem cell transplantation.

The shape and size of the bubble footprint make monitoring chamber stability possible: A small, round footprint suggests a deep and stable chamber, whereas a collapsing chamber results in a broadening and ovalization of the bubble footprint. The injection of intracameral sterile air bubble is an easy intraoperative maneuver to gauge chamber stability when the cornea is not sufficiently clear to allow direct assessment.With the injection of a balanced salt solution, the bubble footprint became small and round, suggesting a stable and deep anterior chamber.Applying fibrin glue (choice A) in this case is unnecessary, because there was no evidence that watertight wound closure could not be achieved with suturing. Filling the chamber with an ophthalmic viscosurgical device (choice B) will maintain its depth temporarily, although collapse is still possible during the washout, and retained ophthalmic viscosurgical device will result in intraocular pressure spikes that may damage the remaining clear cornea. Tilting the microscope (choice D) is unlikely to improve the assessment of chamber depth and stability without the use of a slit beam.Approximately 6 months after bilateral optical iridectomy, the patient had bright red reflexes in both eyes and was able to fixate and pursue small fixation targets. He was followed up closely for suspected glaucoma because of the high risk of glaucoma in Peters anomaly.",JAMA Ophthalmology Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,non-binary,4,augmented_nonbinary

Atypical mycobacterium infection,B,Atypical mycobacterium infection,"Shortly after his presentation to our clinic, the patient developed violaceous skin changes with purulent drainage, which appeared consistent with atypical mycobacterial or nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection (Figure 2). He subsequently underwent drainage and curettage. Histopathologic examination revealed acute chronic inflammation with negative cultures. The infectious disease service started antibiotics for NTM, but they were stopped owing to an adverse reaction. The patient remained asymptomatic for 10 months but had a recurrence in the same area with extension into the parotid gland without involvement of the masseter. He subsequently underwent wide local excision. Cultures returned positive for Mycobacterium abscessus.Right preauricular cutaneous lesion demonstrating the violaceous hue.The differential diagnosis of this condition should include mycobacterium TB adenitis, viral lymphadenitis, hematologic cancer, aerobic abscess, and bartonella henselae.1 While a branchial cleft cyst and chronic sialadenitis with abscess could present similarly, the skin changes and indolent course without systemic symptoms are more suggestive of an NTM. Magnetic resonance imaging showing a necrotic lesion with associated lymphadenopathy is not suggestive of a lymphovascular malformation.An NTM infection can prove to be a diagnostic challenge, especially when the characteristic skin changes are absent and cultures are negative. The typical age of presentation is 1 to 5 years old, with an incidence of 0.77 to 1.3 in 100 000 children.2-5 Hundreds of species exist, but Mycobacterium avium complex is most commonly implicated in lymphadenitis.5 These bacteria are believed to have primarily environmental (soil or water) origins.6 In children, this most commonly involves submandibular or cervical nodes and, less frequently, the preauricular, sublingual, and parotid lymph nodes.1-3,7When suspecting NTM, it is important to rule out TB adenitis because it has a considerably different treatment paradigm.5 Tuberculosis typically has more systemic symptoms, whereas NTM lymphadenitis commonly presents as local erythema and fluctuance without substantial tenderness, which can progress to violaceous skin changes with fistula formation.6 Staining methods include fluorochrome, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Kinyoun, although NTM is visualized in only 30% to 60% of cases.5 Recommendations support performing both solid and broth culture medias, and different species of bacteria require different intubation times (7 days to 12 weeks).5 Polymerase chain reaction testing, when available, tends to have the greatest sensitivity.6 Definitive diagnosis of NTM is with a positive culture, although cultures are only positive in 50% to 82% of specimens, which further adds to the diagnostic difficultly.5Treatment options include observation, antimicrobial agents, surgical procedures, or a combination of any of these.6,7 Antimicrobial therapy alone is associated with a prolonged treatment course with potential adverse effects and a higher rate of recurrence.7 A meta-analysis showed no difference for recurrence rates between antimicrobials vs observation.7 Total surgical excision has demonstrated a cure rate greater than 90% in multiple studies, and as such, current literature supports total surgical excision with or without adjuvant macrolide antimicrobials as the treatment of choice.5-8Special considerations for surgical management of parotid NTM infections include risk of injury to the facial nerve and the psychosocial effect of having a scar on the face.7 In the present case, the patient had fistula formation before surgery; thus, he was already at risk of cosmetic disfiguration from the infected wound even before operating. Of 16 published studies documenting surgical treatment of pediatric parotid NTM infections, in which 59% were total or near total excision, no cases of permanent facial weakness were reported.9 Another study showed a permanent nerve weakness in only 2% of patients undergoing surgery for head and neck NTM.7The present patient was doing well at last follow-up, with full facial function and a well-healing incision. Although NTM of the parotid is an infrequent presentation of a relatively common pediatric infection, it should remain on the differential diagnosis.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,non-binary,30,augmented_nonbinary
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2766241,"A patient in their 30s was incidentally found to have an abnormal electrocardiogram ( ECG ) result .

Atrioventricular dissociation was present, indicating complete heart block. Two pacing stimuli were seen bracketing each QRS complex. These are indicated by the ECG machine with inverted triangles along the top of Figure 2. The QRS morphology was typical of left bundle branch block, consistent with right ventricular pacing. The first stimulus did not precede visible P waves, indicating atrial noncapture; however, this stimulus did result in ventricular depolarization (capture). The second pacing stimulus did not result in either atrial or ventricular capture, which is likely explained by delivery of the pacing stimulus during the ventricular myocardial refractory period. Based on this pattern and the duration between the stimuli (about 180 milliseconds), atrial lead dislodgment with ventricular capture by the atrial lead was the leading differential diagnosis. Lead reversal at the pulse generator could not be excluded using only the surface ECG but was implausible in this case because the postimplantation ECG showed a normal atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm. Additionally, if this patient experienced lead reversal, it would be expected for P waves to be seen following the second pacing stimulus. It is also possible that a second pacing stimulus would not be delivered if the ventricular lead were to sense the atrial stimulus (ie, crosstalk) or, in the case of intact ventriculoatrial conduction, a retrograde P wave.A, Representative leads from presenting electrocardiogram annotated to highlight pacemaker stimuli. B and C, Posteroanterior (B) and lateral (C) chest radiographs demonstrating right atrial lead dislodgment. The right atrial lead has migrated to the right ventricular apex (yellow arrowheads), while the right ventricular lead appears to be affixed to the right ventricular septum (black arrowheads).Chest radiographs (choice C) are the most expeditious means by which to evaluate suspected lead migration. Posteroanterior and lateral films were obtained (Figure 2), confirming right atrial lead dislodgment with migration to the right ventricular apex. The patient was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic, and thus neither transcutaneous pacing (choice B) nor transvenous pacing (choice A) were indicated.1 Medical therapy for bradycardia (eg, atropine) would also not be indicated in absence of symptoms or hemodynamic derangement.1 Placement of a magnet (choice D) would result in asynchronous pacing at the magnet rate.2 This would not be unreasonable, but in this case, this would result in the same pacemaker-stimulus-bracketed QRS pattern but at a higher rate.In this case, the chest radiograph was essential. It would be possible, albeit more challenging, to use the pacemaker itself to differentiate between lead reversal at the pulse generator and lead migration. One strategy would be to reprogram the device to the ventricular demand pacing (VVI) mode of function, which would eliminate atrial pacing output. The first pacing stimulus would then not occur, and stimuli delivered at the right ventricular lead would continue to result in ventricular depolarization. If the atrial demand–inhibited (AAI) mode of function were programmed, the second pacing stimulus would not be delivered and the dislodged atrial stimuli would result in continued ventricular depolarization. With lead reversal, in contrast, programming VVI mode would result in atrial depolarization by stimuli delivered from the ventricular lead, while AAI mode would result in ventricular depolarization by stimuli delivered through the atrial lead. Since VVI pacing would result in only atrial depolarization, it is important to remember that this maneuver could produce ventricular asystole in the setting of absence of atrioventricular conduction.The patient underwent right atrial lead repositioning under fluoroscopic guidance. An ECG obtained after the procedure revealed atrial-ventricular dual-paced rhythm with occasional atrial inhibition by native complexes at a rate of 61 beats per minute, indicating appropriate positions of the atrial and ventricular leads.",JAMA Cardiology Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,non-binary,25,augmented_nonbinary

D , A triangle - shaped first lumbar vertebral body is shown .",Child abuse,Morquio syndrome,GM1 gangliosidosis,Hurler-Scheie syndrome,C. GM1 gangliosidosis,C,GM1 gangliosidosis,"Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy specimen revealed a slightly hyperpigmented epidermis with a moderate increase in melanocytes on S-100 protein and Melan-A staining. In the dermis, multiple S-100 protein–positive fusiform and dendritic cells were found (Figure, B and C), which were also positive on Fontana-Masson staining. Therefore, the histopathological pattern was consistent with a mongolian spot (nevus fuscoceruleus).However, the kyphosis, coarse facial features, muscular hypotonia, and hepatomegaly were consistent with a lysosomal storage disease. Further investigations revealed a cardiomyopathy (left ventricular hypertrophy and mitral insufficiency), as well as ultrasonographic abnormalities in the brain (voluminous hyperechoic basal ganglia). Fundoscopic examination demonstrated a cherry-red spot on the retina. Spot urine analysis was negative for glycosaminoglycans. A chest radiograph showed paddle-shaped ribs, as well as a triangle-shaped body of the first lumbar vertebra (Figure, D), favoring the diagnosis of a lysosomal storage disease.β-Galactosidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes was also significantly reduced, which is indicative of type I (infantile) GM1 gangliosidosis. Subsequent genetic analysis identified a homozygous mutation in exon 2 of the GLB1 gene (c.176G>A p.R59H) (OMIM 611458), confirming the diagnosis. The OMIM accession number of the phenotype (type I GM1 gangliosidosis) is 230500.Nevi fuscocerulei are benign melanocytic congenital birthmarks with a diameter of 3 to 10 cm. They localize in the lumbosacral region, usually resolve during childhood, and predominate in Asian (ie, mongolian spots), American Indian, and African populations.Widespread mongolian spots can be indicative of inborn errors of metabolism, in particular lysosomal storage diseases. Most frequently, these errors include GM1 gangliosidosis (15 cases reported)1-8 and Hurler-Scheie syndrome, followed by Niemann-Pick disease, Hunter syndrome, and α-mannosidosis.9GM1 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive disease. More than 165 mutations in the GLB1 gene (3p22.3), encoding β-galactosidase, have been described. The missense mutation p.R59H (c.176G>A) is the most common mutation found in European patients with GM1 gangliosidosis.10 Enzyme deficiency results in toxic accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in many tissues. In the most severe form (type I), symptoms become apparent by age 6 months. Patients develop hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disability, loss of vision, distinctive facial features, and gingival hypertrophy. They die within the first 2 to 3 years of life. In type II (onset, 1½ to 5 years), there is delayed motor and cognitive development. Life expectancy is shortened.In the adult form (onset, 3-30 years), patients develop dystonia and vertebral abnormalities. Life expectancy correlates with the level of β-galactosidase activity.GM1, one of the major gangliosides, is known to increase nerve growth factor (NGF) activity, mediated by the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptor. In melanocytes, NGF-activated Trk receptor promotes proliferation and is speculated to inhibit transdermal migration. Therefore, mongolian spots in GM1 gangliosidosis are thought to be caused by arrested transdermal migration of melanocytes from the neural crest into the epidermis, leading to their entrapment and proliferation in the dermis.5,6,8,9Multiple and extensive nevi fuscocerulei merit special attention. In some lysosomal storage diseases (eg, Hurler-Scheie syndrome and Hunter syndrome), early diagnosis allows treatment with recombinant enzyme therapy or stem cell transplantation. In untreatable conditions such as the case reported herein, early diagnosis is important for genetic counseling of at-risk families.",JAMA Dermatology Clinicopathological Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,non-binary,13,augmented_nonbinary
