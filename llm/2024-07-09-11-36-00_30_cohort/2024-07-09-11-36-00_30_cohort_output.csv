https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2665411,"A woman in her mid-20s who was 8 weeks pregnant presented to the emergency department for abdominal pain localized in the right iliac fossa (RIF), numbness in the right lower limb, and nausea and vomiting. On examination she had tenderness in the RIF with a positive Blumberg sign; blood testing showed leukocyte count 10 450/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) without any shift, C-reactive protein 1.29 mg/dL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.331), and hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10). The Alvarado score was 7. A transabdominal ultrasonographic scan showed a tubular structure in the RIF consistent with a mildly inflamed appendix and stratification of the appendiceal wall (7 mm in the proximal and 11 mm in the appendiceal distal tract). A small amount of free fluid was present in the Douglas pouch. A transvaginal ultrasonographic scan confirmed normal intrauterine gestation with a vital embryo. Working diagnosis was uncomplicated appendicitis and initial conservative management was amoxicillin clavulanate because of the potential risks of miscarriage associated with performing an avoidable appendectomy and general anesthesia during early gestation. The patient initially improved and was discharged home 2 days later with an Alvarado score of 4; oral antibiotic therapy was continued. Three days later she returned to the emergency department with recurrent pain; the clinical and ultrasonographic findings were unchanged, without evidence of complicated appendicitis, intra-abdominal fluid collection, or abscess. The Alvarado score was 5. The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and given intravenous antibiotics. In the next 48 hours the symptoms and pain did not resolve, although inflammatory markers were low and the patient was not septic. The surgeon on call requested an urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigation (Figure 1).Magnetic resonance imaging showed the gestational chamber and a normal intrauterine pregnancy as well as the presence of a tubular structure in the right iliac fossa (RIF) (A) and what appeared to be an inflamed, thickened appendix (9.83 mm in the proximal appendix) (B).",Acute appendicitis,"Salpingitis or sactosalpinx (eg, pyosalpinx or hydrosalpinx)",Heterotopic pregnancy,Nonspecific abdominal pain or pelvic inflammatory disease,C. Heterotopic pregnancy with normal intrauterine gestation and ruptured tubal pregnancy with hemoperitoneum and a normal appendix.,C,Heterotopic pregnancy,"An MRI confirmed a normal intrauterine pregnancy and the presence in the RIF of a tubular structure gradually enlarging from 10 mm in the proximal tract to 14 mm at the level of distal tip, consistent with a thickened, inflamed appendix, with some surrounding free fluid and few enlarged regional lymph nodes.Diagnostic laparoscopy (Video) showed a macroscopically normal appendix with a large hemoperitoneum. The right fallopian tube was bulky and congested, containing a heterotopic pregnancy, which is a rare condition of a simultaneous intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy,1 with signs of internal bleeding (Figure 2). Right salpingectomy was performed. Appendectomy was considered unnecessary and a potential source of intra-abdominal contamination.Ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the right Fallopian tube with surrounding blood clots and fresh blood responsible for the persistent right iliac fossa pain.One week later, ultrasonography confirmed the well-being of the uterine fetus with normal fetal heart rate and fetal movement. This intrauterine pregnancy was successfully delivered full-term.Pain in the RIF and suspected appendicitis in pregnant patients need a reliable diagnostic assessment and careful differential diagnosis, especially in the early weeks of gestation. Initial conservative management with antibiotics is recommended because of the potential risks of miscarriage associated with appendectomy and general anesthesia during early gestation,2,3 but timely surgical management is mandatory if the symptoms do not resolve after initial nonoperative management.4 This case highlights that diagnostic laparoscopy outperforms MRI in certain cases when MRI cannot demonstrate a definitive diagnosis, whereas laparoscopy may have 100% diagnostic accuracy, representing a life-saving tool—both diagnostic and therapeutic—for experienced clinicans.5The presence of a dilated structure in the RIF can also be attributed to a sactosalpinx, which is a dilated fallopian tube owing to retention of secretions (eg, pyosalpinx [pus] or hydrosalpinx [serous or clear fluid]). Pyosalpinx is one of the features of pelvic inflammatory disease. The RIF pain in young women can also be caused by pelvic inflammatory disease or nonspecific abdominal pain, and the differential diagnosis from appendicitis can be challenging and require laparoscopy. The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy in natural conception is estimated to be 1 in 30 000 pregnancies.1 In this case, the intrauterine pregnancy remained intact and a healthy baby was delivered without complications at term. The MRI findings were reported as acute appendicitis. Performing an open appendectomy via the McBurney incision under spinal anesthesia would have not allowed visualization of the ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and timely diagnostic laparoscopy was life-saving.Nonoperative, conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis is largely debated worldwide, with many studies suggesting its safety and efficacy, whereas recent meta-analyses6,7 highlighted surgery as the definitive, 1-time only, treatment with a well-known risk profile. Management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in pregnant patients is even more debated, representing a viable option with an acceptable risk-benefit ratio in such patients.8 Nonetheless, when symptoms are not resolving and/or differential diagnosis is uncertain, diagnostic laparoscopy is the best option for avoiding delays for treating complicated or ruptured appendicitis9 or, as in our case, for diagnosing alternative life-threatening conditions.Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and use of laparoscopy during pregnancy recommend diagnostic laparoscopy when available resources preclude prompt imaging for diagnosis or imaging is inconclusive. The risks of delayed diagnosis should be weighed against the risk of possible laparoscopy with negative findings (ie, diagnostic laparoscopy without positive findings needing further therapeutic action) . The surgeon should be proficient in treating conditions diagnosed at laparoscopy.10",JAMA Surgery Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,female,778,original,"<answer>

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/1921335,"A 50-year-old healthy woman underwent an uncomplicated elective clipping of a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm via pterional craniotomy. Ophthalmology was consulted urgently in the recovery room because of complaints of vision loss and ophthalmoplegia in the right eye. On examination, visual acuity was no light perception (NLP) OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils were equal and round, with a 3+ relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Intraocular pressure was within normal limits in both eyes. There was complete ophthalmoplegia in the right eye with no signs of restriction on forced ductions and normal motility in the left eye. Visual field was full to confrontation in the left eye. The right eye also demonstrated mild fullness of the orbit, right cheek skin erythema, trace proptosis, and trace conjunctival chemosis. Posterior examination was significant for diffuse retinal whitening with a cherry-red spot in the macula in the right eye (Figure 1A). There were no other neurologic deficits identified on examination.Case presentation. A, Fundus photograph of right eye showing diffuse retinal whitening with a cherry-red spot. B, Immediate postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showing enlarged extraocular muscles on the right side (arrowheads).A computed tomography scan without contrast did not show an acute intracranial hemorrhage and demonstrated diffuse enlargement of the right extraocular muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with contrast again showed enlargement and abnormal signal of the extraocular muscles on the right (Figure 1B); there was no evidence of cavernous sinus pathology.",Immediate surgical re-exploration,Emergent angiography,Immediate anticoagulation,Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis,Orbital infarction syndrome,B,Emergent angiography,"In the setting of sudden painless vision loss with ophthalmoplegia and extraocular muscle enlargement immediately after craniotomy, one would be concerned about acute occlusion of the ophthalmic artery and its branches. Although computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging did not show any gross hemorrhage, further neuroimaging with angiography to evaluate the status of the aneurysm clipping, as well as the state of the ophthalmic artery circulation, would be the most appropriate next step.As the intraocular pressure was within normal limits and the patient had negative forced ductions, there was no suggestion of an orbital compartment syndrome that would necessitate a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis at this time. Surgical exploration would not be warranted because of a lack of clear etiology. There was no indication for anticoagulation at this time.The triad of sudden painless severe visual loss, complete ophthalmoplegia, and a fundus examination consistent with a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is highly suggestive of orbital infarction syndrome.1 Orbital infarction results in retinal infarction, choroidal ischemia, and ophthalmoplegia. Ophthalmic artery occlusion alone cannot cause these symptoms because of the extensive anastomoses between the ophthalmic artery and external carotid artery.Orbital infarction syndrome has been reported in the setting of acute hypoperfusion, systemic vasculitides such as giant cell arteritis, and extensive thrombosis secondary to mucormycosis.1 All cases had a characteristic constellation of symptoms including severe vision loss—often NLP—complete ophthalmoplegia, proptosis or orbital congestion, and a fundus examination consistent with a CRAO. Orbital infarction syndrome has been reported postoperatively after intracranial aneurysm clipping and spinal surgery as well as due to orbital cellulitis after transcanalicular dacryocystorhinostomy.2-4 The mechanism for postsurgical orbital infarction syndrome is unclear. A myocutaneous flap is raised in these surgeries for the craniotomy, which may cause indirect or direct pressure on the orbits, resulting in hypoperfusion.2 Other factors speculated to play a role are increased intracranial pressure and systemic hypotension, which may cause relative hypoperfusion to the orbit.Orbital infarction syndrome was likely due to a combination of these factors. Angiography showed intact clipping of the aneurysm as well as patent flow through the ophthalmic artery and its branches (Figure 2A). This suggests the ischemic event must have been transient, though sustained long enough to cause permanent damage. Patients with orbital infarction syndrome can also develop a delayed orbital compartment syndrome. Twelve hours after surgery, our patient had increased proptosis and intraocular ocular pressure of 34 mm Hg, and a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis were performed. On follow-up at 2 weeks, the ophthalmoplegia and orbital congestion had resolved but vision remained NLP. Fundus examination demonstrated a pale nerve, attenuated vessels, and diffuse retinal pigment epithelium clumping (Figure 2B).Postoperative imaging of orbital infarction syndrome.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2531476,"An otherwise healthy woman in her 50s was evaluated in the emergency department for persistently blurry vision in both eyes after a routine eye examination with dilation 5 days earlier. She had a history of high myopia, astigmatism, and mild cataracts, as well as narrow angles, for which she had undergone laser peripheral iridotomy in both eyes a number of years earlier. Her review of systems was normal, and she had no relevant family history of ocular disease. The best-corrected visual acuity measured 20/100 OD and 20/200 OS, with manifest refractions of −9.00 −1.25 × 090 OD and −8.50 −0.75 × 086 OS. Intraocular pressure measured 12 mm Hg OU. The pupils were middilated and poorly reactive. There were patent peripheral iridotomies bilaterally. The lenses were displaced into the anterior chambers without any lenticular zonules visible. There was central lenticulocorneal touch bilaterally with trace Descemet membrane folds at the points of contact (Figure). The posterior segment examination results were unremarkable.",Pharmacologically redilate the pupils and position the patient supinely,Schedule the patient for lensectomies with anterior vitrectomy and intraocular lens placement,Refer the patient for connective tissue disease workup,Observe and reevaluate the patient in 2 months,Bilateral lens dislocation in a patient with isolated microspherophakia,B,Schedule the patient for lensectomies with anterior vitrectomy and intraocular lens placement,"Microspherophakic lenses are small and rounded, with increased anteroposterior thickness. The lenses can usually be seen in their entirety when the pupil is dilated. The cause of microspherophakia is uncertain, but it has been theorized to result from a lack of tension on the lenticular zonules, which arrests the development of the lens in its rudimentary spherical configuration.1 Microspherophakia has been noted to occur in association with a number of conditions (eg, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Alport syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome), but it can also be seen in isolation or as an autosomal dominant or recessive familial anomaly.2Patients with microspherophakia often have defective accommodation, and the spherical shape of the lenses results in myopia. This patient definitely had lenticular myopia; her axial lengths measured only 21.64 mm OD and 21.41 mm OS, and her keratometry values were 43.34 @ 94° / 46.58 @ 4° OD and 44.32 @ 81° / 46.21 @ 171° OS. In addition to generating lenticular myopia, these abnormal lenses may also narrow the anterior chamber and lead to angle-closure glaucoma, and laser peripheral iridotomy is often recommended early in management.3 The lenses may also dislocate anteriorly, causing a pupillary block.4,5 In cases of a pupillary block in patients with microspherophakia, the status of the zonules is usually uncertain. When the zonules are known to be intact, there are several methods that may aid in shifting the lens posteriorly, including cycloplegia, hyperosmotic agents to shrink the vitreous, and supine positioning.6This patient came to the emergency department having already been dilated by an outside physician and with the lenses entirely in the anterior chambers. She had previously undergone bilateral laser peripheral iridotomy, and her intraocular pressures remained normal. Zonules were not seen at all, so repeated dilation was not a good option in her case, as it might have risked lenticular displacement to the posterior pole. In refractory cases of microspherophakia with anterior lens displacement, lensectomy with vitrectomy, sutured and anterior chamber intraocular lens placement, and glaucoma shunt have been described.6,7 This patient underwent modified small-incision cataract surgery with anterior vitrectomy and the placement of a scleral-sutured intraocular lens with Hoffman pockets in the left eye and, 2 days later, in the right eye. In summary, this case demonstrates the potential for anterior lens dislocation following routine dilation in an adult patient with isolated microspherophakia. Microspherophakia should be in the differential diagnosis for patients with small, rounded lenses and narrow angles. There are various strategies for managing complications associated with microspherophakia. In cases of known microspherophakia, assessment for possible phacodonesis should be part of the ophthalmic examination, and caution should be used with routine dilation.The patient tolerated the procedures well, and the best-corrected visual acuity 1 month later was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS.

At the dermoepidermal junction, there was a lichenoid predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate with interface change. On the basis of the clinical distribution of the eruption and corresponding histopathologic findings, a diagnosis of lichen planus (LP) actinicus was made. The patient was instructed to wear sun block on sun-exposed areas of the body. He was also prescribed clobetasol propionate, 0.05%, ointment with improvement of pruritus and the appearance of LP actinicus.Lichen planus actinicus is a rare subtype of LP that is not commonly seen in the United States. Most reported cases have occurred in individuals with dark complexions of Middle Eastern and Indian descent living in subtropical regions.1,2 Other names commonly used for this condition include actinic LP, summertime actinic lichenoid eruption, LP atrophicus annularis, and LP subtropicalis. The incidence of LP is less than 1% of the total population, whereas LP actinicus has been estimated at 1 case per million inhabitants per year.3There are 4 morphologic variants: annular hyperpigmented, melasma-like, dyschromic, and classic lichenoid. The annular hyperpigmented type is the most common form of LP actinicus and usually presents on the dorsum of the fingers and hands. All forms of LP actinicus are exacerbated by sun exposure and most remit during the winter.4 Our patient presented with both the classic lichenoid and annular hyperpigmented types.Lichen planus actinicus differs from classic LP by presenting in areas of sun-exposed skin, with a predilection for the head, dorsum of the hands, and extensor surfaces of the upper extremities, whereas classic LP usually spares the head and more commonly affects the trunk and the flexural extremities.2 Lichen planus actinicus also exhibits seasonal onset in the spring and summer, whereas classic LP reveals no seasonal predilection.

The patient denied any drainage from the site but reported worsening swelling and pain over the past several weeks. On physical examination, there was noted intraoral swelling involving the buccal and palatal aspects of the posterior maxilla. The lesion was soft and fluctuant with no appreciable drainage. The patient’s history was notable for an 8-year history of right maxillary first premolar impaction. Findings from computed tomography of the head demonstrated a relatively spherical 4-cm growth of the right anterior maxilla abutting the maxillary sinus and orbital floors, and enclosing an impacted premolar at the superior margin of the growth (Figure, A). There was no proptosis or visual field changes associated with the lesion. An incisional biopsy was performed via an intraoral approach, and results demonstrated a thickly encapsulated proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells with pseudoglandular elements (Figure, B and C). Following diagnostic confirmation, the patient was taken to the operating room, and a midface (Weber-Ferguson) incision was used to access the maxillary lesion for complete removal.A, Sagittal computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck demonstrating an expansile, 5.0-cm mass enclosing an impacted first maxillary premolar (white arrowhead). B, Neoplastic proliferation of swirls and anastomosing cords of odontogenic epithelium with formation of psuedoglandular structures (black arrowheads; hematoxylin-eosin). C, High-powered view of ductlike structures (black arrowhead; hematoxylin-eosin).",Dentigerous cyst,Odontogenic keratocyst (keratocystic odontogenic tumor),Ameloblastoma,Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor,D. Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor,D,Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor,"Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are uncommon odontogenic neoplasms with a highly characteristic clinical presentation.1,2 Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors typically present in the second decade of life and are given the epithet two-thirds tumor because approximately two-thirds of cases occur in women, approximately two-thirds of cases present in the maxilla, and approximately two-thirds of cases are associated with an impacted canine. When associated with an impacted tooth, the radiolucency frequently encompasses the entire tooth, as in the case of the present patient. This radiographic finding is rather unique and stands as a distinguishing feature from the majority of radiolucencies associated with impacted teeth, which are pericoronal (ie, specifically around the crown and not the roots of an impacted tooth). These usually represent hyperplastic dental follicles or dentigerous cysts.Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are benign and slow growing but locally expansile. They typically range in size from 2 to 3 cm, though larger lesions have been reported. Presentation with pain is infrequent and is likely owing to large size. Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors may also occasionally occur in the gingival soft tissues, although this is less common.3 Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are treated conservatively with enucleation and curettage, and recurrence is rare; a review of the literature by Philipsen et al4 identified 3 recurrences in 750 documented cases.The name adenomatoid odontogenic tumor is derived from the characteristic histopathologic features,5 as illustrated in the present case. The histopathologic findings consist of a neoplastic proliferation of whorls and strands of odontogenic epithelium that can be variably solid or cystic. The name adenomatoid refers to the ductlike or rosettelike structures seen invariably in a majority of adenomatoid odontogenic tumors. Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are thickly encapsulated in all cases, and this likely accounts for the minimal recurrence rates following conservative excision. Areas resembling calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor may be seen within adenomatoid odontogenic tumors in approximately 25% of cases and are of no prognostic importance because these hybrid neoplasms are not associated with the more aggressive behavior characteristic of calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumors.6 Recently, KRAS mutations have been identified in 71% of adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, indicating a role for mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation in the development of these neoplasms.7While the demographic and clinical presentation of the present case is strongly suggestive of an adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, other more common odontogenic cysts and neoplasms should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The dentigerous cyst is a common sequela of tooth impaction and represents a hyperplasia of epithelial and mesenchymal tissues involved in odontogenesis. Classically, this disease process is pericoronal.8 Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (odontogenic keratocyst) and ameloblastoma are 2 of the most common and most aggressive benign odontogenic neoplasms and are characterized by PTCH1 and BRAF mutations, respectively.9,10 These present as radiolucencies that may or may not be associated with an impacted tooth, mimicking dentigerous cyst; their predilection is for the posterior mandible, but they may involve any portion of the jaws. These conditions require more aggressive surgical treatment, and diagnostic confirmation via biopsy is necessary to plan optimal surgical management. The present patient underwent successful conservative excision of the mass with no complications, and at 9-month follow-up, has demonstrated no sign of recurrence or adverse events related to surgery.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,female,296,original,"<answer>

The parent noted that clear fluid drained from this bump when the patient ate. In addition, the parent reported that, at birth, the patient failed multiple hearing tests and that he had small kidneys. The patient was asymptomatic. Upon physical examination, the patient was noted to have a preauricular sinus and ear pit as well as a skin-colored papule on the antitragus of the right ear. He also had a pedunculated, skin-colored papule on the right lateral neck.Photograph of infant’s lateral neck depicting skin-colored papule with clear drainage.",Alport syndrome,Branchio-oto-renal syndrome,Goldenhar syndrome (oculoauriculovertebral spectrum),Papillorenal syndrome,B. Branchio-oto-renal syndrome,B,Branchio-oto-renal syndrome,"The skin-colored papule on the patient’s ear was consistent with an accessory tragus and the location and history of the lesion on the right lateral neck made it likely to be a branchial cleft cyst, fistula, or remnant. Based on the likely branchial cleft cyst, renal abnormalities, and ear findings, branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome was suspected. The patient underwent ultrasonography of the neck, which revealed a cutaneous tract or fistula extending to the subcutaneous tissues of the neck and likely to the hypopharynx or esophagus. Results of abdominal ultrasonography revealed small kidneys with increased echogenicity. The kidneys measured 4.3 cm and 3.9 cm in length (normal for the patient’s age, 6.2 cm). Nephrology evaluation supported the diagnosis of BOR syndrome. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were normal and no additional renal testing was completed.Branchio-oto-renal syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous developmental disorder characterized by ear, renal, and branchial anomalies. It accounts for an estimated 2% of cases of congenital deafness, with an incidence of 1 in 40 000.1 The most common features of BOR syndrome include hearing impairment, auricular malformation, branchial fistulae or cysts, preauricular sinuses or ear pits, and renal abnormalities.2 Renal anomalies range from mild hypoplasia to aplasia and agenesis.3-5 Hearing loss in BOR syndrome is progressive and may be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed.3 Some branchial anomalies are asymptomatic, but symptomatic branchial cleft fistulae often present with recurrent infections.6Major diagnostic criteria for BOR syndrome include branchial abnormalities, hearing deficit, preauricular pits, and renal abnormalities. Minor criteria include external, middle, or internal ear abnormalities; preauricular tags; facial asymmetry; and palate abnormalities. For a diagnosis of BOR syndrome, an individual must have a minimum of either 3 major criteria or 2 major criteria and 2 minor criteria.7 The diagnosis may also be considered in an individual with any of these abnormalities and a family history of possible BOR syndrome.7 Other findings reported in BOR syndrome include lacrimal duct stenosis, retrognathia, facial nerve palsy, and pancreatic duplication cysts.3,4Most often, BOR syndrome results from mutations in the EYA1 gene (OMIM 601653), located on chromosome 8, and is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern.8 Mutations in the SIX5 gene (OMIM 600963) are also associated, although much less frequently.9 Proteins encoded by the EYA1 and SIX genes form a complex that activates DNA transcription, and mutations in these genes disrupt complex formation.9 Transcription activation by the EYA1 and SIX proteins is involved in the development of fetal tissues of the second branchial arch, from which the neck, eyes, ears, and kidneys are derived. In roughly 40% of individuals meeting the criteria for BOR syndrome, EYA1 mutations are present.7 Most of these mutations can be detected by gene sequence analysis, but approximately 20% are owing to chromosomal rearrangements of EYA1 and require more advanced testing.7There have been cases of misdiagnosis of BOR syndrome as Alport syndrome, owing to clinical similarities between the 2 conditions.4 Alport syndrome is caused by defective type 4 collagen and presents during the first decade of life with hematuria, hearing loss, and ophthalmologic abnormalities.10 Hearing loss in patients with Alport syndrome tends to present during mid-childhood to late childhood rather than in infancy.10Goldenhar syndrome and papillorenal syndrome were also included in the differential. Papillorenal syndrome is characterized by optic disc dysplasia and renal hypoplasia; this diagnosis would not explain our patient’s auricular findings. Goldenhar syndrome typically presents with auricular malformations, bony spinal deformities, hemifacial microsomia, and benign growths of the eye.Families may not seek medical attention immediately if a child is not experiencing significant functional deficits secondary to the condition, as was the case with this 8-month-old patient. Cutaneous findings such as a draining papule, preauricular ear pits, and/or an accessory tragus may be clues to investigate the possibility of BOR syndrome.",JAMA Pediatrics Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,male,738,original,"<answer>

The patient’s uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OD and 15 mm Hg OS. Confrontational visual fields and results of external eye examination were normal. She had full ocular motility and no afferent pupillary defect. Results of the right eye fundus examination were unremarkable (Figure, A). The left eye (Figure, B) had tortuosity and dilation of all branches of the retinal vein, disc edema, scattered intraretinal hemorrhages, and nasal macula nerve fiber layer infarcts. The vitreous was clear, macula flat, and there was no retinal neovascularization.

Young age and lack of common risk factors for CRVO, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, was concerning for underlying systemic disease. We inquired about the patient’s medical and family history of hypercoagulable and inflammatory states associated with CRVO in young patients (choice C).1 Treatment is reserved for sequelae of CRVO, such as macular edema or neovascularization, none of which were present in our patient. Macular edema causing vision loss typically is treated with intravitreous anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy (choice B) and also may resolve with intravitreous corticosteroids (choice A) or, when due to a branch retinal vein occlusion, grid laser treatment. Neovascularization may be treated with scatter photocoagulation (choice D)2 or intravitreous anti-VEGF therapy. The patient’s primary care physician diagnosed her as having factor V Leiden mutation, a hypercoagulable state associated with CRVO. The patient reported that her father was previously diagnosed as having factor V Leiden mutation after a branch retinal vein occlusion was diagnosed at 48 years of age.Globally, the prevalence of CRVO is 0.8% and increases from 0.027% to 0.5% from the fourth to eighth decade of life.3 Individuals younger than 50 years of age make up less than 20% of cases.4Review of medical and family history may be necessary in young adults with CRVO and diagnostic testing may be performed to assess for systemic disease.2 Although not proof of causality, associated systemic disease was found in 40% to 67% of young adults with CRVO.4,5 Inquiry might include hereditary thrombophilias, blood dyscrasias, autoimmune disease, and HIV.4 Pregnancy, use of OCPs, hormone therapy, and diuretics also might be considered.1,4,6 Dehydration has been implicated in some reports of young patients with CRVO.7,8 Assessment also might include measurement of blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, complete blood cell count, lipid profile, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.9 Diagnostic studies, often performed by the primary care physician, may include HIV and pregnancy tests, coagulation panel, and autoimmune markers,4 although the risk to benefit ratio of these workups has not been elucidated.Thrombophilias, including resistance to activated protein C, antiphospholipid antibodies, factor XII deficiency, and anticoagulant protein deficiencies, have been associated with CRVO in young patients.6 These disorders, however, are not rare in the general population without CRVO, raising the possibility that CRVO is unrelated when reported in association with these abnormalities. Factor V Leiden mutation is found in 5% of the general population and 7.9% of those with retinal vein occlusion.10Oral contraception is also associated with CRVO. More than 20% of patients with perfused CRVO and younger than 45 years used OCPs,1 although it could be that a matched control group would have a similar percentage of OCP users. Thus, the risk to benefit ratio of recommending that individuals with CRVOs not commence OCPs remains unknown. Discontinuation of OCPs after CRVO probably should be decided on a case-by-case basis.9Our patient’s primary care physician was informed of the CRVO to consider with any management of factor V Leiden mutation. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents are not routinely prescribed after diagnosis of CRVO as a first thrombotic event in those with factor V Leiden mutation because of the unknown risk to benefit ratio. Our patient discontinued OCPs, after discussion about risks and benefits, and started aspirin, although the precise risk to benefit ratio of this management is not known.

Positive Congo red stain results confirmed the presence of amyloid protein (Figure, B and C).The patient underwent an extensive evaluation for hematological malignant abnormalities in coordination with hematology/oncology specialists as well as assessment of cardiac and renal involvement. Serum protein electrophoresis results were negative for paraprotein although κ and λ were elevated. A complete blood cell count with differential, urinalysis, metabolic panel, and liver function test results were normal. Echocardiogram results were unremarkable. He will be followed up by dermatology and hematology specialists to monitor for clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic disease.Primary cutaneous nodular amyloidosis is a rare disorder characterized by the localized accumulation of light-chain amyloid protein, secreted by lesional plasma cells. This is in contrast to the more common cutaneous lichen and macular amyloidosis, in which the amyloid protein derives from keratin.The morphological presentation of nodular amyloidosis is that of localized, waxy, infiltrated nodules or plaques with typical distribution of lower extremities, face, scalp, and genitals. Lesions are typically asymptomatic but can be pruritic.1 Because the clinical and pathological appearance of nodular amyloidosis can be indistinguishable from that of systemic amyloidosis, systemic involvement must be excluded in order to make the correct diagnosis. Systemic amyloidosis can result in a restrictive cardiomyopathy, proteinuria up to nephrotic range, hepatomegaly, as well as peripheral and autonomic neuropathy.2Even when distinguished from systemic amyloid, patients with localized disease require continued monitoring owing to the possibility of progression to systemic involvement. While early studies estimated this risk at around 50%, larger and more recent case series have shown progression to occur in roughly 7% of patients.1 The disease has been more rarely associated with other concomitant indolent hematologic malignant diseases.3 In addition to malignant abnormality, nodular amyloid has been reported to occur with systemic autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren syndrome and limited scleroderma.4,5Several reports have attempted to determine the clonality of plasma cells in nodular amyloid lesions. Plasma cells appear to be clonal; except in cases associated with Sjogren syndrome where both monoclonal and polyclonal infiltrates have been described.4,6 In monoclonal cases, nodular amyloid can be thought of as etiopathogenically similar plasmacytoma, with nodular amyloidosis displaying a much sparser plasma cell infiltrate but one in which the cells have a much greater secretory capacity.Nodular amyloidosis can also be understood as a manifestation of a group of disorders characterized by isolated, tissue-specific deposition of amyloid, typically of light-chain composition, by local collections of secretory monoclonal plasma cells. These disorders, referred to as amyloidomas, have been shown to occur in the central nervous system, bone, as well as a variety of levels within the respiratory and genitourinary tracts.7,8Given the rarity of cases, no standard modality exists for treatment of nodular amyloidosis.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2796096,"A man in his mid-50s with a history of mitral valve repair presented to the emergency department with complaints of recent-onset palpitation within the last hour. On physical examination, the patient showed a rhythmic tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min; no obvious P waves were recognizable (Figure 1A). The QRS complexes displayed 2 different morphologies occurring with a definite allorhythmic distribution: pairs of beats exhibiting complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and QRS duration of 140 milliseconds followed by a third beat with normal configuration and QRS duration of 70 milliseconds. This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained. Adenosine administration quickly slowed the ventricular rate allowing recognition of an atrial tachycardia with a rate of 178/min and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio (Figure 1B).A, Regular supraventricular tachycardia with right bundle branch block aberration disappearing every third beat. B, Lead II. Numbers within the tracing indicate the R-R intervals (in milliseconds). The variability in ventricular cycle lengths results from small changes in both the P-P and P-R intervals.",Perform urgent DC shock,Place a temporary pacemaker and start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone,Start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone,Order an urgent electrophysiologic investigation,Atypical atrial flutter with RBBB aberration and conduction improvement every third beat resulting from concealed type I (Wenckebach) second-degree block in the right bundle branch with 3:2 ratio,C,Start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone,"The atrial rate during adenosine administration was identical to the ventricular rate during tachycardia, implying that the arrhythmia in Figure 1A reflects an atrial tachycardia with 1:1 AV conduction. The medical history strongly suggests a macroreentrant circuit (macroreentrant atrial tachycardia, also called atypical atrial flutter) developing around the atriotomy scar related to mitral valve surgery, possibly a left-sided atrial flutter such as mitral annular flutter. The R-R interval prolongation due to the shift from 1:1 to 2:1 AV ratio restored the normal right bundle branch conduction resulting in narrow QRS complexes. This supports an intermittent phase 3 RBBB. The most challenging issue in the tracing on presentation is the periodic disappearance of the RBBB aberration. The key to the correct diagnosis is the unexpected normalization of the QRS morphology occurring periodically, every third beat, despite constant cycle lengths.1-4A pattern of complete bundle branch block does not necessarily imply a total interruption of conduction in the affected bundle branch but can also result from a delay exceeding the time required for activation from the contralateral bundle branch (accepted critical delay: 40-60 milliseconds).3 In a Wenckebach series, whenever the opening beat is normally conducted whereas complete bundle branch block occurs in the second impulse, progressive conduction delays in later beats and final failure do not further affect QRS morphology and width: the bundle branch Wenckebach phenomenon, therefore, is “incompletely concealed” being inapparent on ECG only from the second to the closing beat of each sequence.3,4 As illustrated schematically in Figure 2, while the conduction through the left bundle branch is normal, the right bundle branch shows increasingly impaired conduction owing to an area of refractoriness leading to progressive prolongation of the conduction time, until a block occurs in the third impulse of each Wenckebach series. Impulse 1 conducts down both bundle branches normally (conduction time: 40 milliseconds), resulting in narrow QRS. Impulse 2 penetrates the critical area within the right bundle branch with delayed conduction (right bundle conduction time: 90 milliseconds). Although a complete block in the right bundle branch does not occur, the delayed conduction results in ventricular depolarization via the left bundle branch, resulting in a complete RBBB pattern. Impulse 3 represents further impaired conduction and a true block in the right bundle branch. The proximal bidirectional block during the third impulse of each Wenckebach sequence doubles the effective cycle length of the right bundle branch, increasing its recovery time to 2 R-R intervals, thereby allowing normal conduction of impulse 4. This prolonged cycle length, furthermore, extends the right bundle refractory period following the normalized beat so that the second impulse of the next Wenckebach sequence once again conducts with RBBB aberration, and the mechanism then repeats.1,2 Accordingly, the Wenckebach phenomenon in the right bundle branch is incompletely concealed and is evident only on the first to second beats.3,4 Incompletely concealed Wenckebach-type block in a bundle branch was first postulated by Rosenbaum in 1969 in order to explain periodical improvements of aberrant conduction unrelated to changes in cycle length.3Schematic explanation of the behavior of intraventricular conduction. Numbers above the strip are the R-R intervals. An area of refractoriness within the right bundle results in progressively impaired conduction (red: normal conduction; gray: delayed conduction; black: conduction failure). Concealed 3:2 Wenckebach-type conduction occurs over the right bundle branch. CT indicates conduction time (in milliseconds); LB, left bundle, RB, right bundle.Alternate explanations are less convincing. Disappearance of the RBBB pattern every third beat theoretically could reflect fusion of supraventricular impulses with trigeminal right ventricular extrasystoles. However, a regular repetition of such ectopics in a fixed trigeminal rhythm with perfect synchronization with atrial impulses is unlikely; furthermore, no ventricular extrasystoles were evidenced throughout the tracing.1,2 The findings in this ECG are compatible with a 3:1 RBBB. However, such a high conduction ratio in a bundle branch is extremely rare especially in a repetitive fashion. Moreover, in order to invoke a 3:1 RBBB, a very long right bundle branch refractory period, extending over 2 cardiac cycles (>675 milliseconds), has to be assumed. Nevertheless, as the rate slows with adenosine and normal right bundle conduction resumes, some R-R intervals measuring 630 to 670 milliseconds occur (Figure 1B), which excludes this possibility.3,4Although the conduction disturbance may have been the result of mitral valve surgery, a Wenckebach-type bundle branch block occurring at fast rates does not necessarily indicate a damaged conduction system, but may represent merely a functional, phase 3 delay in the distal His-Purkinje system.1 Amiodarone infusion restored sinus rhythm, leading to persistent normalization of intraventricular conduction. Given the very recent onset of tachycardia and the low risk of stroke, postcardioversion anticoagulation was omitted.5,6 No recurrence of atrial flutter and/or RBBB was documented over a 1-year follow-up while receiving oral amiodarone.",JAMA Cardiology Clinical Challenge ,ECG indicates electrocardiogram.Place a temporary pacemaker and start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone What Would You Do Next?,male,131,original,"<answer>

After strabismus surgery, he was noted to have a nonhealing conjunctival epithelial defect inferiorly, which later developed underlying scleral thinning. He was being treated with topical moxifloxacin, 0.5%, every 2 hours in the left eye. He noted a medical history of hyperthyroidism, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He also noted a history of substantial blood glucose elevation after taking oral prednisone.A review of systems had negative results, including the absence of joint pain, fevers, chills, weight loss, and rashes. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and counting fingers OS, and his intraocular pressures were 13 mm Hg OD and 4 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination of the left eye revealed marked inferior redness, including large-caliber episcleral vessels and scleral thinning that was greatest inferonasally (Figure 1A). There was an epithelial defect overlying the thinned sclera, scleral tenderness to palpation, 16 to 25 cells per high-power field in the anterior chamber, and iris neovascularization.

Necrotizing scleritis is a rare complication of ophthalmic surgery that typically presents as a focal area of intense scleral inflammation at the site of a previous surgery.1 It is thought to be a local autoimmune reaction and can be associated with systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, thyroid disease, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Histology of involved sclera shows a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, the nature of which is not fully understood.2,3 One theory is that surgical trauma exposes antigens from a normally immune-privileged site; following surgery, the immune system may produce antibodies to these newly exposed antigens. Exudative retinal detachment with necrotizing scleritis associated with surgery is very rare.4Necrotizing scleritis associated with surgery is more likely to occur after multiple surgeries, and while it can occur in the immediate postoperative period, it may manifest months and even decades later.5-7 In a large case series, the mean onset was 9 months after surgery in patients with a history of 2 or more ocular surgeries and 9.5 years in patients with only 1 ocular procedure.2 Management typically requires systemic immunosuppression. Patients may be started on prednisone at 1 mg/kg/d, followed by a steroid-sparing agent.8 Surgical reinforcement of scleral thinning may be required to prevent globe perforation.9For this patient, fortified antibiotics (choice A) would not be recommended, because he was already receiving topical antibiotics. Topical steroids and cycloplegia (choice B) would be insufficient treatment, given the severity of inflammation. Systemic steroids and outpatient follow-up (choice C) would be inappropriate in this patient because of his previous uncontrolled blood glucose levels while receiving oral prednisone. There is an established association between aggressive early systemic immunosuppression and a favorable visual acuity prognosis in necrotizing scleritis associated with surgery. Immunosuppression initiated within 1 month of scleritis onset seems to improve visual acuity prognosis, whereas initiation of immunosuppression after 3 months is associated with worse visual acuity outcomes.1This patient was admitted and started receiving oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/d. A rheumatology consult was requested, and an extensive autoimmune and infectious workup had negative results, including cultures and tests for quantiferon gold, syphilis IgG, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, lysosomes, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibody, and rheumatoid factor. During his hospitalization, he received intracameral bevacizumab to treat the iris neovascularization and underwent a scleral patch graft with amniotic membrane transplant over the area of scleral thinning. The rheumatology service started oral azathioprine and tapered the prednisone.By 3 weeks after presentation, the eye showed no obvious inflammation (Figure 2), and B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated resolved retinal detachment. His visual acuity improved to 20/200 OS, but his visual acuity prognosis was guarded because of the delay between symptom onset and initiation of systemic immunosuppression, which resulted in a likely long-standing exudative retinal detachment.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2771004,"A 69-year-old man with a smoking history and complaints of back pain and cough for 2 weeks was found to have a right lung mass on chest radiography results. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a right upper lobe lung mass with multiple lymphadenopathies (N3), and bone scan and brain magnetic resonance imaging results showed multiple metastatic foci. A biopsy was performed, and the pathologic report showed a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma with ROS1 rearrangement identified by immunohistochemical staining (clone: D4D6; H-score: 280) and further confirmative fluorescence in situ hybridization. The patient received ceritinib, 450 mg/day, and his tumor and brain and bone metastatic lesions subsequently decreased in size. The ceritinib was then shifted to crizotinib, 500 mg/day, when the reimbursement of crizotinib as a first-line therapy was approved by Taiwan's National Health Insurance system.Three weeks after the first dose of crizotinib, the patient developed a dry cough without fever or purulent sputum. There was no significant finding on physical examination except mild crackles over the right lung field, although chest radiography results showed a new consolidation lesion over the right upper lobe. Meanwhile, the results of mycobacterial and bacteriologic surveys were unremarkable. The tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen level decreased from an initial 14.76 to 0.71 ng/mL (reference range, 0-5.00 ng/mL [to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1]). A CT scan was arranged, and developing lung cancer with lymphangitic carcinomatosis was highly suspected by the radiologist (Figure, A). A bronchoscopy with bronchial brushing and biopsy was performed, and no pathogen was identified.A, The comparison of the chest computed tomographic (CT) scan of the new consolidation lesion (red arrowheads) mimicking recurrence (right panel) with the primary tumor (yellow arrowhead) in the initial CT scan (left panel).

Perform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation",D,"Perform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation","The pathological findings of the patient’s CT-guided biopsy were compatible with inflammation or SLR. The main feature of this patient was the mild presenting symptom but with the rapid development of consolidated lung with interstitial pneumonia on his CT scan. The diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was rejected because the patient had a dry cough only, and findings of bronchial washings were negative. Disease recurrence was considered, but the decreasing carcinoembryonic antigen levels  seemed inconsistent. Although a similar CT finding can be found in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)–induced interstitial lung disease (ILD), the mild symptom was incompatible with this diagnosis. There was no direct evidence to support the change of treatment to chemotherapy or steroids. With this in mind, clinicians must consider rebiopsy, and the diagnosis of the SLR was compatible with clinical symptoms and CT findings.Cancer-associated SLR is characterized by epithelioid cell granulomas with T-cell infiltration in pathologic findings (Figure, B) and observed in patients with hematological malignancies or solid tumors. In contrast to sarcoidosis with systemic involvement, cancer-associated SLR is usually asymptomatic, and the incidence of SLR lymphadenopathy in lung cancer ranges from 1.3% to 11%.1 Sarcoid-like reaction with ground-glass pulmonary infiltrates or lung consolidation is rare. Although fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is useful for evaluating the recurrence of lung cancer, it has been reported to produce false-positive results in cases of SLR.2Sarcoid-like reactions  are elicited by antigenic factors released from the tumor cells and are mostly identified in the lymph nodes draining a malignant tumor. These antigenic factors may be either shed by the tumor cells or released during tumor necrosis. Therefore, such reactions can be identified at diagnosis or after chemotherapy and immunotherapy.3 In infiltrating tumors, the production of interferon gamma by local natural killer cells and T cells activates the dendritic cells, which then present the antigen to naive CD4+ T cells, converting them into T helper 1 cells and contributing to the maturation of macrophages and granuloma formation. In an observational cohort study of 127 patients with lung cancer undergoing curative resection, 19 (14.9%) had coexistent granulomatous inflammation in the resected specimen.1 Some treatments for cancer may produce necrotic material or metabolic substances and induce granulomatosis, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for bladder cancer and interleukin-2 treatment for kidney cell carcinoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed the therapeutic landscape for lung cancer, and several reports have described the development of SLRs after the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 inhibitors.4 Assessing the expression of programmed cell death (PD) 1 and PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients receiving nivolumab therapy, a recent study showed that an elevated expression of PD-L1 sequential to blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction can be associated with SLRs.5Although SLRs have been reported in patients receiving chemotherapy and immunotherapy, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a pulmonary consolidation pattern in a patient with ROS1 rearrangement receiving an anaplastic lymphoma kinase/ROS1 inhibitor. Sarcoid-like reactions often respond to corticosteroid treatment and do not require the discontinuation of treatment. Conversely, in TKI-induced ILDs, the destroyed endothelium of alveolar vessels or pneumocytes leads to the release of cytokines and the recruitment of more inflammatory cells that, in turn, induce more damage to the endothelial cells.6 Deaths associated with TKI-induced ILD have been reported, and permanent discontinuation of TKIs is required in severe cases.In this case, while the patient’s dry cough was not severe, he decided to halt his crizotinib use. He further refused steroid use and asked to resume the ceritinib treatment. His dry cough improved substantially, and the lung consolidation lesion subsequently decreased (Figure, B). In conclusion, in cases involving a radiological pattern of disease progression, such as a new lung consolidation lesion associated with TKI use, our article suggests that a routine rebiopsy is needed to confirm the SLR and avoid misinterpretation.",JAMA Oncology Clinical Challenge ,"The CT scan after resuming ceritinib treatment for 2 months showed decreased lung consolidation and the primary tumor (yellow arrowhead).Treat with chemotherapy for disease recurrence because the agents available for recurrent ROS1 tumors remain limitedAdminister antibiotics with coverage for pneumonia pathogen for 7 to 10 days and a repeated CT scan in 4 weeksAdminister steroid treatment and discontinue crizotinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) permanently because TKI-induced interstitial lung disease is highly suspectedPerform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation What Is Your Diagnosis?",male,301,original,"<answer>

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2616370,"An 80-year-old man with a history of hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease presented with 2 days of anuria. He felt well until 6 days prior, when he awoke with diffuse muscle cramps following a strenuous day of moving boxes. He subsequently developed oliguria that progressed to anuria. His only medication was omeprazole (20 mg daily). His usual fluid intake had not changed.Physical examination was notable for moist mucous membranes, clear lungs, no lower extremity or periorbital edema, and no jugular venous distension. Examination was otherwise unremarkable. Bladder scan showed 50 mL of urine, which was collected via straight catheterization. Three liters of normal saline was administered, with no further urine production.Laboratory testing revealed a blood urea nitrogen level of 90 mg/dL (32.1 mmol/L) (reference range, 7-21 mg/dL [2.5-7.5 mmol/L]) and creatinine level of 14.1 mg/dL (1246.4 μmol/L) (reference range, 0.6-1.17 mg/dL [53.0-103.4 μmol/L]); baseline levels 3 months prior were 37 mg/dL (13.2 mmol/L) and 3.3 mg/dL (291.7 μmol/L), respectively. Hemoglobin level was 10.6 g/dL (reference range, 13-17 g/dL); calcium, 8.1 mg/dL (reference range, 8.5-10.1 mg/dL); potassium, 6.2 mmol/L (reference range, 3.5-4.7 mmol/L); and phosphorous 8.8 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) (reference range, 2.5-4.9 mg/dL [0.81-1.58 mmol/L]). Creatine kinase level was within normal limits.

Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated positivity for the plasma cell marker CD138 (Figure, right panel).Left, Bone marrow biopsy sample (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×400). Right, Immunohistochemical staining of biopsy sample (immunohistochemical stain for CD138, original magnification ×400).",Continue IV fluids and administer furosemide,Initiate bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy,Obtain renal biopsy,Order skeletal survey,Multiple myeloma complicated by cast nephropathy,B,Initiate bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy,"The key to the correct diagnosis is the markedly elevated serum κ to λ ratio, which is diagnostic of multiple myeloma, regardless of bone imaging results. Acute renal impairment in this setting is highly indicative of cast nephropathy, and renal biopsy should not delay treatment. Although hydration is imperative, furosemide may worsen cast nephropathy and should be avoided.2 Patients presenting with multiple myeloma and acute renal impairment attributed to cast nephropathy should urgently receive bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy to suppress light-chain production, with consideration of simultaneous mechanical removal of FLCs, to optimize renal recovery.According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG),3 this patient meets criteria for active multiple myeloma reflected by clonal bone marrow plasma cells 10% or greater and by a serum involved to uninvolved FLC ratio greater than 100, qualifying as a myeloma-defining event. Specifically, evidence of end-organ damage (CRAB criteria: hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, bone lesions) is no longer exclusively required to diagnose multiple myeloma.3 For patients previously categorized as having smoldering myeloma, the inclusion of myeloma-defining events allows for earlier recognition of patients at high risk for progression who would benefit from early intervention.Renal impairment is one of the most common complications of multiple myeloma, with risk proportional to urinary FLC concentration.4 In this patient, urinary FLCs could not be confirmed prior to initiation of therapy, although urinalysis at admission did show significant nonalbumin proteinuria. This, along with serum κ FLC concentration greater than 500 mg/L, strongly suggested cast nephropathy, circumventing the need for renal biopsy.5 Acute renal impairment in this setting is a medical emergency, warranting rapid initiation of antimyeloma therapy to reduce circulating FLCs and restore renal function, because dialysis dependence confers increased mortality.6On recognition of multiple myeloma–related renal impairment, aggressive hydration should be initiated, hypercalcemia corrected, and nephrotoxic agents avoided.5 The IMWG recommends prompt initiation of antimyeloma treatment with bortezomib-based regimens, as several studies have demonstrated superior renal recovery and rates of dialysis independence5,7 (grade A recommendation). The IMWG also recommends high-dose dexamethasone for at least the first month of therapy (grade B)5 for more rapid renal responses.7 Although immunomodulatory drugs such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide are options, these may require renal dosing and can be less effective in this setting.5 Thus, for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who have acute renal impairment, bortezomib-dexamethasone–based regimens are considered first-line therapy. More recently, bortezomib-dexamethasone plus another agent (triplet therapy) has demonstrated superior renal outcomes, including higher rates of dialysis discontinuation, resulting in improved survival.8Mechanical approaches, such as high-cutoff hemodialysis (HCO-HD) or plasma exchange, are occasionally used in conjunction with systemic antimyeloma therapy to rapidly remove FLCs from circulation. Of these, data supporting HCO-HD, which allows FLC removal through large pores, are more promising for reversal of renal impairment and dialysis independence.9 The evidence supporting plasmapheresis is controversial, limited by small trials with conflicting outcomes.5 Randomized clinical trials are ongoing to better define the role of adjunctive mechanical approaches for patients with myeloma-related renal impairment requiring dialysis. According to IMWG guidelines in 2016, in patients with multiple myeloma and acute renal impairment strongly suspected to have light chain cast nephropathy, HCO-HD should be attempted first (grade B). If unavailable, plasma exchange is a reasonable alternative (grade C).5This case highlights a recent shift in the diagnostic criteria for active multiple myeloma and offers an opportunity to discuss specific management options for myeloma-related renal impairment.The patient received bortezomib-dexamethasone plus 3 cycles of plasmapheresis, with lowering of serum FLC level and improvement in urine output. There was significant recovery of renal function; dialysis was reduced to twice weekly after 3 months of antimyeloma therapy and was no longer required after 6 months.",JAMA Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,male,941,original,"<answer>

The shape of the opacity was similar to the trunk of the MPA and showed alternating expansion and contraction during the cardiac cycle. The opening and closing of the pulmonary valve were visible at the inferior part of the translucent shadow (Figure; Video). This was diagnosed as a large pulmonary artery air embolism in the MPA.Pericardial effusion leading to pericardial tamponade is a rare complication of BMV. However, acute tamponade is accompanied by hypotension. Also, on fluoroscopy, tamponade will appear as a decreased movement of cardiac borders along with separation of visceral and parietal pericardium due to accumulation of blood, which was not present in this case. Hence, pericardiocentesis was not indicated. Acute massive pulmonary thromboembolism in the MPA gives rise to acute-onset hypotension and dyspnea, but fluoroscopy is usually unremarkable. Rarely, fluoroscopy may show a prominent pulmonary artery, an enlarged right descending pulmonary artery (Palla sign), an abrupt cutoff of vessels, elevated hemidiaphragm along with focal pulmonary oligemia (Westermark sign), and peripheral, pleural-based, wedge-shaped opacity (Hampton hump) due to pulmonary infarction. Acute pulmonary embolism appears as a filling defect on contrast angiography rather than on fluoroscopy. As none of these features was present, intravenous thrombolytic and catheter-directed embolectomy were not indicated in this patient.Massive pulmonary artery air embolism was previously described among patients who were undergoing pacemaker implantation.1 The most common risk factors for air embolism during an intervention are dehydration, low central venous pressure, coughing, deep inspiration, old age, use of a large central venous sheath, and deep sedation. The symptoms of an air embolism can be asymptomatic to life-threatening depending on its size.2 If an air embolism occurs with resulting hypotension, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be started immediately. Patients should be given 100% oxygen and intravenous fluids, along with inotropic support and cardiopulmonary resuscitation as needed.2 Recently, the Durant maneuver (left lateral decubitus position) has been described for the management of air embolism in preference to the Trendelenburg position. In rare cases, the use of a catheter has been described for the suction of air from the pulmonary artery.3The BMV procedure was stopped immediately, and the patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position and started treatment with 100% oxygen and intravenous fluids. A decision was made to remove the air in the MPA using Judkins right coronary catheter, but the air embolus was absorbed within 3 to 4 minutes with the medical management alone.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2698086,"A 62-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department after she was found unresponsive on the ground with a presumed cardiac arrest. She had pulseless electrical activity. After resuscitation, the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved. She remained comatose and was intubated for airway protection. She had a history of deep vein thrombosis 3 years prior but was not receiving long-term anticoagulation. A physical examination revealed a rapid irregular pulse, no jugular venous distension, clear lung fields, and no cardiac murmurs. There was no peripheral edema. Laboratory findings were notable only for a troponin T level of 2.41 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). An electrocardiogram (ECG) and a point-of-care transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) were obtained (Figure 1; Video).",Cardiac catheterization,Computed tomography of the head,Pulmonary computed tomography angiography,Transesophageal echocardiography,Neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy,B,Computed tomography of the head,"Elevated cardiac enzyme levels, ST-segment depression in the precordial leads on the ECG (Figure 1A), and regional wall motion abnormalities on TTE (Figure 1B; Video) were all concerning for an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cardiac arrest. A cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography could be considered after the return of spontaneous circulation. Nevertheless, there were also important discriminating imaging features in the TTE that could suggest another diagnosis; the wall motion abnormality only involved the midventricular wall, without involvement of the basal or apical segments of the left ventricle. The midventricular (hypokinetic) and apical/basal (hyperkinetic) segments exhibited a discrepant contractile pattern. This “spindle-shaped” ventricular contractile dysfunction was not consistent with the myocardial territory of a single coronary artery. Taking her manifestation and unique imaging findings into account, we gave priority to a computed tomography of the head, which showed a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with an intraventricular extension (Figure 2). Therefore, neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy (NSC) was diagnosed. Given her history of deep vein thrombosis, a pulmonary embolism could possibly cause pulseless electrical activity and new-onset atrial fibrillation. However, the characteristic TTE findings prompted us to seek a different diagnosis, and performing pulmonary computed tomography angiography was not the first choice. A transesophageal echocardiography might improve the visualization of intracardiac anatomic structures, but it is unlikely that it would offer further diagnostic help.Computed tomography image of the head showing a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (asterisks) with intraventricular extension.Intracranial hemorrhage, particularly SAH, is the leading cause of NSC. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can occur acutely and improve spontaneously over days to weeks. Neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy is thought to be caused by hemorrhage, ischemia, or edema of the hypothalamus, which stimulates the release of endogenous catecholamine and results in an extensive spasm of the systemic arteries, including the coronary arteries.1 In contrast to classical stress-induced cardiomyopathy, or Takotsubo syndrome, which is often associated with an LV “apical ballooning” pattern, NSC more commonly causes an “inverse” contractile dysfunction, which involves basal and middle, but not apical, LV segments.2 The cause of this difference is unclear, but neither ventricular contractile pattern is consistent with the myocardial territory of a single coronary artery, helping distinguish NSC and Takotsubo syndrome from AMI.The clinical manifestation and ECG changes of NSC can resemble those of AMI, including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Current guidelines advocate using coronary angiography to direct the diagnosis and therapy.3 However, if SAH-induced NSC is misdiagnosed as AMI, anticoagulation and antiplatelet treatment can exacerbate bleeding. Even more catastrophic would be the use of fibrinolytic therapy in those hospitals that lack a catheterization laboratory. Characteristic noninvasive cardiac imaging findings can help appropriately triage patients with NSC and avoid harmful procedures/treatments and adverse events. Surveillance echocardiography can help assess the recovery of LV function during follow-up. The timely diagnosis of NSC also has important implications in management. In patients with hemodynamic instability, catecholamine inotropic and pressor agents should be avoided. α-adrenergic agonists are useful in maintaining peripheral vascular pressure and supporting cerebral perfusion. While the actual effect of intra-aortic balloon pumps is uncertain in patients with LV outflow tract obstruction, hemodynamic support from baroreflex activation therapy3 and percutaneously inserted ventricular assist devices4 are targets of current and future research. Because of limited donor organ availability, only about 10% of patients in the United States who may benefit from a heart transplant undergo this procedure annually. Meanwhile, many of the patients who experience brain death from neurological insults are deemed unsuitable donors for cardiac transplantation because of NSC. The LV dysfunction during stress-induced cardiomyopathy is usually reversible. In the largest analysis of donor hearts with transient LV dysfunction, such hearts have been successfully transplanted without increasing recipient mortality rates.5 Further investigation is warranted to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and reversibility of NSC, which may increase the number of donor hearts that would otherwise be rejected primarily because of poor LV function.Because of the anoxic brain injury and irreversible neurological dysfunction, the goals of care were transitioned to comfort measures. As a candidate for organ donation, she underwent serial echocardiography that documented a complete resolution of LV systolic dysfunction within 48 hours. Cardiac catheterization results confirmed a healthy coronary anatomy. However, she did not become a heart donor eventually because of controversies on accepting donor hearts with transient LV dysfunction.",JAMA Cardiology Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,female,651,original,"<answer>

Over the same period, he also developed thickened, brittle, and discolored fingernails and toenails. More recently, he developed progressive exertional dyspnea and edema of both lower extremities. He had no joint pain or swelling and no chest pain. He was taking amlodipine (5 mg daily) and ipratropium bromide nasal spray twice daily.On examination, he was afebrile. Heart rate was 66/min; blood pressure, 132/72 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 18/min; and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, 97% on room air. He had yellow discoloration and thickening of his fingernails and toenails (Figure 1A). A few nails showed distal onycholysis. He had partially nonpitting edema of the lower extremities (Figure 1B). Auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds at the lung bases but no rhonchi or crackles. Percussion of the lung bases and vocal resonance were normal. Cardiac and abdominal examination findings were unremarkable.A, Yellow discoloration and thickening of fingernails and toenails. Few nails showed distal onycholysis. B, Partially nonpitting edema of the lower extremities with a positive Stemmer sign (difficulty pinching the skin on the dorsum of the toes), suggestive of lymphedema.Laboratory testing revealed normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyrotropin level. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 2 mm/h; C-reactive protein level was 0.1 mg/dL. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was positive (1:160, nucleolar pattern), but results of testing for antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens and double-stranded DNA were negative. He had mildly low C3 complement level (63 mg/dL [reference range, 79-152 mg/dL]), but normal C4 complement level (20 mg/dL [reference range, 16-38 mg/dL]). Immunoglobulin levels were normal.

Onychomycosis (option A) would not explain the other manifestations described in this case. Although dystrophic nails can be seen in psoriasis, looking for evidence of psoriatic arthritis (option B) in the absence of joint symptoms would not be justified. Additionally, the other manifestations described in this case would not be explained by psoriasis. In the of setting of yellow thickened nails, sinopulmonary manifestations, and lymphedema, exertional shortness of breath is likely related to serositis, bronchiectasis, or both, and therefore the next step to evaluate these pulmonary manifestations of yellow nail syndrome would be to obtain a thoracic CT scan (option C). Severe iron deficiency (option D) can be associated with koilonychia (spooning of nails, in which nails lose their convexity and become flat or even concave in shape) but not with yellow dystrophic nails. It would also be unlikely in the absence of anemia. Although ANA testing was positive and C3 complement level was low, in the absence of antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens and double-stranded DNA, these laboratory findings are nonspecific and not diagnostic for systemic lupus erythematosus.Yellow nail syndrome is characterized by a triad of yellow thickened nails, chronic sinopleuropulmonary manifestations (rhinosinusitis, cough, bronchiectasis, and serositis), and lymphedema of the lower extremities. It is a rare acquired disorder, with fewer than 400 cases reported so far and an estimated prevalence of less than 1/1 000 000.1 It usually occurs in adults older than 50 years. There is no sex predilection.The exact etiology of yellow nail syndrome is unknown. It is hypothesized that structural or functional abnormalities of lymphatics result in oxidation of accumulated lipids, which leads to yellow discoloration of nails.1,2 Nail growth slows down longitudinally, but nail thickness is doubled.1 The nails have absent lunula and cuticle. Onycholysis is common.Most pleural effusions in patients with yellow nail syndrome have been described as exudative and serous.3 Less frequently, the pleural fluid can be milky or even chylous.3 There may be a temporal correlation with various malignancies (notably lung, breast, gallbladder, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), which raises the possibility of yellow nail syndrome being a paraneoplastic syndrome, although this view is controversial.1Management of yellow nail syndrome is symptomatic. However, in about 50% of patients, spontaneous resolution occurs without specific therapy. Oral vitamin E supplementation,1,4 along with triazole antifungals,1,5 has shown some success in normalizing nail discoloration. Repeat thoracentesis, pleurodesis, and even decortication/pleurectomy may be necessary for recurrent pleural effusions.1,3 Prophylactic antibiotics may be prescribed for bronchiectasis.5 Low-stretch bandages and elastic compression stockings are helpful for symptomatic management of lymphedema, along with local skin care, exercises, and even manual lymph drainage.1Thoracic CT scan revealed bronchiectasis, bilateral pleural effusions, and a large circumferential pericardial effusion (Figure 2). On thoracentesis, 1400 mL of straw-colored fluid was drained from the right pleural space. The patient also underwent pericardiocentesis and a pericardial window procedure.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2717584,"A previously healthy man in his 30s presented with a 5-day history of fever, anorexia, and rash. Five days before arrival, he developed throat pain, rhinorrhea, nonproductive cough, and fever. Two days later he noticed a maculopapular rash on his neck and trunk, which later involved his upper and lower extremities. He did not smoke and only drank alcohol occasionally. He was living in Japan and recently visited a neighboring island but denied any international travel.On examination, his blood pressure was 142/84 mm Hg; temperature, 38.3°C; pulse, 91/min; respiratory rate, 24/min; and oxygen saturation, 97% on ambient air. He was alert and oriented. There were no mucosal lesions or conjunctival injection. A maculopapular rash was noted on the trunk and extremities (Figure) as well as the palms and soles. The face was not involved. The lungs were clear to auscultation. No hepatosplenomegaly was noted. Neurologic examination, including results of motor, sensory, and reflex testing, was unremarkable. There was no neck stiffness or lymphadenopathy. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 2900/μL (80% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, and 0% basophils); hemoglobin level, 15.2 g/dL; and platelet count, 187 ×103/μL. Serum electrolyte levels were normal. Aspartate aminotransferase level was 635 U/L (10.6 μkat/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 491 U/L (8.2 μkat/L); lactate dehydrogenase, 807 U/L (13.48 μkat/L); γ-glutamyltransferase, 329 U/L (5.49 μkat/L); and bilirubin, 1.3 mg/dL (22.24 μmol/L).",Administer an intravenous steroid,Obtain an HIV immunoassay,Perform liver biopsy,Initiate negative-pressure isolation,Measles,D,Initiate negative-pressure isolation,"The key to the correct diagnosis is the presence of fever, maculopapular rash, and cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis.1 People with measles may develop complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis,2 and hepatitis,3 as in this case. A high index of suspicion is warranted from both medical and public health perspectives, because the basic reproduction number (the number of secondary cases generated by 1 patient) of measles ranges from 14 to 18.2 This number is significantly higher than that for other airborne infectious diseases (approximately 5 to 7). The contagious period extends from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of the rash.2 Both standard and airborne precautions should be implemented,4 including isolating patients to negative-pressure rooms.Glucocorticoids should be avoided in this setting because they may increase the risk of developing sepsis. Hepatitis associated with acute HIV infection is rare, and isolation should be prioritized when measles is suspected. Histopathologic evaluation is invasive and therefore not the best next step for making a diagnosis of measles.Measles remains a highly contagious viral infection worldwide. In 2017, there were 149 142 cases reported worldwide.5 Measles can be a diagnostic challenge during the prodromal phase because the maculopapular rash may not be visible until 4 to 7 days after disease onset.2 Additionally, patients with preexisting immunity may develop modified measles with a prolonged incubation period and mild symptoms.6 This patient did not recall any vaccination history, nor could we obtain his vaccination records; however, the severity of his presentation suggested no prior vaccination.Complications occur in approximately 30% of adults and children with measles.6 In a retrospective analysis, an elevated ALT level was observed in 67.5% of 147 consecutive adult patients. Liver involvement was more common in men than women, and 23% presented with an ALT level more than 5 times the upper normal limit (185 U/L [3.09 μkat/L]).3 Levels of ALT and aspartate aminotransferase were reported to be higher in young adults than in children.7Serology test results, such as a positive antimeasles virus IgM result or a 4-fold increase in level of antimeasles virus IgG, are commonly used in making the diagnosis.6 Alternatively, the detection of the measles virus RNA by polymerase chain reaction is useful because it allows genotype identification and helps distinguish wild-type measles from vaccine-associated measles during outbreaks.1No specific antiviral therapy is currently available for measles. Case reports have suggested the effectiveness of ribavirin in severe cases.8 In acute pediatric cases, the World Health Organization recommends the administration of vitamin A because its deficiency is associated with delayed recovery and an increased complication rate.9 Specific antiviral agents are currently at various stages of development, including intranasally delivered fusion-inhibitory peptides.10For prevention, 2 doses of vaccine after 1 year of age are recommended. One dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine ensures that 95% of children develop immunity; this number increases to 99% with 2 doses.6 Vaccine-associated complications are rare.2Additional history revealed that this patient had visited an area with a measles outbreak on a neighboring island. The detection of measles virus RNA by polymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis. Serology test results for other viral infectious diseases, including Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and hepatitis A, B, and E virus, were negative.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2631309,"A woman in her 80s presented with a 1-year history of pruritic erythema on the trunk and extremities. The erythema did not respond to topical corticosteroid, oral roxithromycin (300 mg/d), or narrow-band UV-B phototherapy. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension and was treated with glimepiride, sitagliptin phosphate hydrate, and amlodipine besylate. The patient also had polymyalgia, which was treated with a low dose of prednisolone. The prednisolone therapy had been discontinued 2 months before her visit to the dermatology clinic when she had been hospitalized with pneumonia. Multiple tense blisters had subsequently appeared on the palms. Physical examination at the first visit revealed scaly erythematous plaques on the whole body and tense blisters on the arms, hands, soles, and buttocks. Neither scar formation or mucosal involvement was observed. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from a bulla on the forearm. Histopathologic analysis revealed a subepidermal bulla with inflammatory infiltrates of neutrophils. The results of an IgG chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay for bullous pemphigoid (BP) 180 noncollagenous (NC) 16A were negative. After treatment with oral prednisolone, 20 mg/d, the lesions healed without scar or milia formation (Figure 1).Clinical features before (A) and after (B) treatment with oral prednisolone, showing no scar formation.",Bullous pemphigoid,Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita,Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid,Linear IgA dermatosis,C. Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid,C,Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid,"Direct immunofluorescence (IF) showed linear deposition of IgG and C3, but no IgA, at the basement membrane zone (BMZ). Indirect IF using 1 mol/L sodium chloride–split skin showed that the patient’s IgG antibodies labeled the dermal side of the split (Figure 2A). Serum anti–type VII collagen IgG antibodies detected by human type VII collagen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were within normal range. Immunoblotting of purified human laminin 211/221 (CC085, Chemicon/Merck Millipore) identified anti–laminin γ1 IgG antibodies (Figure 2B). Prednisolone was tapered without relapse of skin lesions. One year after her initial treatment, the patient’s condition was controlled with oral prednisolone, 7.5 mg/d.A, Indirect immunofluorescence using 1M sodium chloride–split skin showed reactivity of the patient’s IgG antibodies to the dermal side of the basement membrane zone. B, Immunoblot analysis of purified human laminin 211/221. IgG antibodies against laminin γ1 were detected in the patient’s serum but not in healthy control serum. mAb indicates mouse anti–human laminin γ1 monoclonal antibody (sc-13144, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is a rare subepidermal autoimmune blistering disease, characterized by circulating autoantibodies against a 200-kDa laminin γ1 protein at the dermal-epidermal junction. It was first described as anti-p200 pemphigoid in 19961,2; in 2009, Dainichi et al3 identified laminin γ1 as the autoantigen in 90% of cases and proposed a new name, anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid.The clinical presentation of anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid can be like that of bullous pemphigoid and the inflammatory variant of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Most patients present with itchy urticarial plaques and tense blisters, often on the acral sites and extremities. Lesions usually heal without scar or milia formation4 unless the disease is accompanied by other autoimmune bullous diseases that involve scar formation, such as epidermolysis bullosa acquisita or anti–laminin 332 mucous membrane pemphigoid.5The diagnosis of anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is confirmed by histopathologic analysis, IF microscopy analyses, and detection of the specific autoantibodies. Histopathological examination shows subepidermal split formation and typically accumulation of neutrophils and/or eosinophils in the papillary dermis. Direct IF shows linear deposits of IgG and C3 along the BMZ. If serum autoantibodies bind to the dermal side of the artificial split by indirect IF microscopy on 1M sodium chloride–split skin, the differential diagnoses would include epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, anti–laminin 332 pemphigoid, and anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid. In the present case, no circulating anti–type VII collagen IgG antibodies were detected. Anti–laminin 332 pemphigoid can usually be clinically differentiated from anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid by the lack of mucosal lesions, although 20% of patients with anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid develop them. The diagnosis of anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is definitive with detection of anti–laminin γ1 IgG antibodies by immunoblotting studies, or human laminin γ1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The standard therapy for anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid has not been defined. Most cases are successfully treated with mild or moderate immunosuppressive therapies such as oral corticosteroids, minocycline, dapsone, and cyclosporine.4In summary, subepidermal bullous disease with circulating autoantibodies against the dermal side of the basement membrane zone and healing without scar formation are the key criteria supporting the diagnosis of anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid. Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid should be considered in patients with subepidermal blister formation without anti-BP180 or type VII collagen antibodies and can be diagnosed by the detection of anti–laminin γ1 autoantibodies.",JAMA Dermatology Clinicopathological Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,female,822,original,"<answer>

She denied experiencing pain, diplopia, muscle weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, difficulty breathing, or other neurologic deficits.On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally, with normal color vision, visual fields, intraocular pressure, extraocular movements, alignment, and pupils. External examination was notable for left upper eyelid ptosis (Figure 1), with a margin-to-reflex distance 1 of 3.5 mm on the right and 0.5 mm on the left, intact levator function, and no fatiguability on sustained upgaze. There was no evidence of eyelid edema, erythema, or tenderness to palpation. There were no palpable adnexal masses or orbital rim deformities, but there was mild fullness in the left superior sulcus and mildly increased left-sided resistance to retropulsion. However, Hertel exophthalmometry did not reveal any relative proptosis. No lacrimal gland abnormalities or conjunctival masses were seen with upper eyelid eversion. There was no palpable preauricular or cervical lymphadenopathy. Slitlamp and fundus examination findings were normal.

While the most common cause of ptosis in adults is involutional ptosis related to levator dehiscence, other diagnoses should be considered in patients with abnormal clinical findings in addition to ptosis. In such patients, an appropriate workup should be completed prior to surgical repair, making choice A incorrect.Although ptosis that is more notable at night and with fatigue is classically seen with myasthenia gravis, patients with ptosis of other etiologies may report similar symptoms owing to reduced compensatory frontalis action by the end of the day. This patient did not have any neurologic signs or fatiguability on examination, and antiacetylcholine receptor serology findings were negative, making myasthenia gravis less likely and choice B incorrect. Similarly, the patient had normal levator function and extraocular motility, making myogenic ptosis less likely and choice C also incorrect. However, unilateral findings of superior sulcus fullness and increased resistance to retropulsion were concerning for an orbital process, making choice D the most appropriate next step. In this case, orbital imaging revealed a well-demarcated tumor involving the left lacrimal gland, with mass effect on the superior rectus-levator complex (Figure 2). Subsequent biopsy and workup demonstrated mantle cell lymphoma without systemic involvement.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with contrast showing a markedly enlarged left lacrimal gland with molding to adjacent ocular structures without bony erosion (main panel, arrowhead). There was also inferior displacement of the left globe with mass effect on the superior rectus-levator complex. A diagnostic biopsy was performed, which revealed mantle cell lymphoma. Three months after the patient completed radiation therapy, repeated MRI showed marked reduction in size of the previously enlarged left lacrimal gland, with near uniform enhancement comparable with that of the right lacrimal gland (left lower insert, arrowhead).Lacrimal gland tumors typically present with progressive proptosis and upper eyelid swelling over the course of 12 months or longer but can present with a shorter duration of symptoms, including ptosis.1-3 On magnetic resonance imaging, lacrimal gland lymphomas classically appear as well-defined masses that conform to the globe and adjacent orbital bones, are mildly hypointense to isointense on T1- and T2-weighted images, and enhance with contrast.3,4 Once a lacrimal gland biopsy confirms the diagnosis, systemic evaluation is performed for staging and treatment planning.4,5Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, representing 2% to 7% of ocular adnexal lymphomas, and is characterized by widespread disease on presentation, an aggressive clinical course, frequent recurrences, and poor survival.6 Current therapeutic options include radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, but systemic therapy may be advantageous even in stage I and II disease because of high risk of relapse.7 Although the prognosis for most ocular adnexal lymphomas is generally good, with a 5-year disease-specific survival of 81%,1,8 5-year disease-specific survival for ocular adnexal mantle cell lymphomas can be as low as 38%.6 Regardless of the initial treatment response, all patients require long-term surveillance for disease recurrence.7This case illustrates how lacrimal gland lymphomas can present as unilateral ptosis and underscores the importance of performing a thorough clinical examination (eg, palpation of periocular soft tissues and resistance to retropulsion) followed by an appropriate workup, which can lead to early detection and treatment of potentially life-threatening conditions.This patient received 24 Gy of radiation to the left lacrimal gland for localized disease. Three months after treatment, repeated magnetic resonance imaging showed significant reduction in left lacrimal gland size (Figure 2).

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/1903126,"A 55-year-old man presented with diffuse, painful swelling of the right upper eyelid (Figure, A). The patient’s medical history was notable for rheumatoid arthritis that had been well controlled with methotrexate for 15 years. The lesion was first noted 6 months prior to presentation and was initially diagnosed as a chalazion. The nodule increased in size during the next several months despite conservative measures including warm compresses. A biopsy revealed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate without evidence of neoplasia, supporting a diagnosis of chalazion. Intralesional triamcinolone was then administered. Despite an initial decrease in lesion size, 6 weeks postinjection, new-onset ipsilateral extraocular motility deficits and palpable preauricular lymphadenopathy were noted. A magnetic resonance image revealed an infiltrative process in the involved eyelid and lymphadenopathy (Figure, B and C). A second biopsy of the eyelid lesion revealed large, atypical lymphocytes diffusely positive for CD20 and negative for CD5 and Bcl-1 (Figure, D-G), supporting a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Findings from systemic evaluation, including complete blood cell count, serum protein electrophoresis, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and whole-body positron emission tomography, were unremarkable.A, Swollen right upper eyelid.

In this setting, non-Hodgkin lymphoma is frequently associated with EBV infection. For example, in posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders, 90% have been shown to be associated with EBV infection.9Epstein-Barr virus has also been implicated in lymphoma occurring in patients with RA treated with long-term methotrexate therapy. Waldman and Callen4 reviewed 13 cases of lymphoma associated with methotrexate and found that 9 patients were EBV positive. In this subgroup, 8 of 9 cases demonstrated complete resolution following methotrexate discontinuation. Following methotrexate withdrawal, spontaneous tumor regression has been reported in up to 59% of patients with methotrexate-associated lymphomas, with complete remission generally occurring within 4 weeks.10 Owing to the high rate of spontaneous regression, rheumatologists and oncologists often observe methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative lesions following cessation of immunosuppression rather than immediately starting chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy. An observation period of up to 2 months following cessation of methotrexate before initiating lymphoma treatment has been advocated.Methotrexate was discontinued at the advice of the patient’s rheumatologist. No other intervention or treatment was pursued. Following cessation of methotrexate therapy, the eyelid lesion and the preauricular lymphadenopathy rapidly resolved over 2 weeks, and no local or systemic recurrence was noted after 26 months of follow-up.Despite the clinical response to methotrexate withdrawal, the patient’s EBV status was assessed retrospectively and was negative. Long-term follow-up and vigilance for recurrence is warranted in patients like ours.Fewer than 20 cases of B-cell lymphoma involving the eyelids have been reported. To our knowledge, this is the first case of DLBCL of the eyelid that demonstrated spontaneous regression following cessation of immunosuppressive therapy. This case also highlighted the fact that in cases of recurrent chalazia—in addition to sebaceous carcinoma—lymphomatous infiltration should also be included in the differential diagnosis, especially in the setting of immunosuppression.",JAMA Ophthalmology Clinical Challenge ,"Biopsy of the eyelid lesion showing large atypical lymphocytes on hematoxylin-eosin stain (D, original magnification ×400) that was positive for CD20 (E, original magnification ×100), negative for CD5 (F, original magnification ×100), and negative for Bcl-1 (G, original magnification ×100).Determine Epstein-Barr virus status and consider observation following cessation of methotrexate therapy What Would You Do Next?",male,1429,original,"<answer>

Upon evaluation, guaiac-positive stools were found and follow-up colonoscopy revealed an invasive adenocarcinoma of the cecum. He was scheduled for a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. Preoperative stress echocardiogram revealed no significant cardiac dysfunction. Immediately before surgery, sequential compression devices were placed on his legs to reduce the risk for venous thromboembolic disease. Following his uncomplicated operation, pulse oximetry showed oxygen desaturation requiring supplemental oxygen. The patient developed paroxysmal tachycardia on the third postoperative day. He had no chest pain or mental status alteration. On physical examination, his pulse was 130/min and irregularly irregular, blood pressure was 126/59 mm Hg, and breath sounds were diminished in bibasilar lung fields. The abdomen was soft and laparoscopy port sites were clean and free of erythema, blood, or exudate. A bedside 12-lead electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and no ST-segment elevation. Portable chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema. Laboratory values are shown in the Table.The patient is in congestive heart failure and needs a loop diuretic.The patient is in congestive heart failure and should have a pulmonary artery catheter placed.The patient has a pulmonary embolus and needs computed tomography angiography of the chest.The patient has symptomatic anemia and needs 2 units of packed red blood cells transfused.",The patient is in congestive heart failure and needs a loop diuretic.,The patient is in congestive heart failure and should have a pulmonary artery catheter placed.,The patient has a pulmonary embolus and needs computed tomography angiography of the chest.,The patient has symptomatic anemia and needs 2 units of packed red blood cells transfused.,,A,The patient is in congestive heart failure and needs a loop diuretic.,"Serum b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are commonly used to predict systolic dysfunction in congestive heart failure. BNP is a peptide with diuretic and vasodilatory effects, secreted by cardiomyocytes in response to intraventricular volume increases.1,2 BNP levels may be used to estimate left ventricular end-diastolic volume when pulmonary artery catheterization and bedside echocardiography are unavailable. Among patients with systolic failure, BNP levels greater than 100 pg/mL correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) greater than 15 mm Hg with a sensitivity of 57% to 74%.1,2 BNP does not correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with normal systolic function who have conditions such as pulmonary embolism, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute renal failure.3-5BNP levels may predict postoperative morbidity. Elevated BNP predicted cardiac morbidity after major vascular operations.6 Serial postoperative BNP levels parallel net fluid balance with an increase and gradual decline, an effect amplified in patients with poor cardiovascular compliance.7 The Medicare midpoint reimbursement for a BNP assay is $63.8 Measuring BNP level is a cost-effective alternative to invasive procedures and imaging modalities for assessment of postoperative fluid volume status.This patient’s tachyarrhythmia is the most immediate concern. A bedside 12-lead electrocardiogram is necessary to exclude acute ischemia and unstable rhythms. In this setting, the cause of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation should be investigated. Supraventricular tachycardia in elderly postoperative patients commonly occurs from electrolyte disturbances, volume overload, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation.9 An echocardiogram, serial serum troponin levels, and a ventilation-perfusion scan were ordered to evaluate the possibility of myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism.This patient’s BNP level is elevated, reflecting stretch of ventricular cardiomyocytes. The elevated BNP level, positive fluid balance, pulmonary edema, and persistent supplemental oxygen requirement suggest the patient has volume overload and would benefit from loop diuretics. Although the patient experienced some hypoxia, given the high likelihood for congestive heart failure, administration of diuretics is indicated. If the patient did not improve after diuresis and remained hypoxic, evaluation for a pulmonary embolus by computed tomography angiography would be reasonable. Transfusion when the patient has volume overload is not indicated and should be reconsidered after the diuretics are given and the hemoglobin level remeasured.A single postoperative BNP level may not be a reliable indicator of volume status. Because this patient’s atrial fibrillation and renal insufficiency may contribute to elevated baseline BNP, preoperative and serial BNP levels may have provided more independently accurate information about the extent of his hypervolemia. Congestive heart failure can also be diagnosed by pulmonary artery catheter placement or by echocardiography.Other low-cost, noninvasive assessments of volume overload include daily weight measurement and portable chest radiography, which may show evidence of fluid overload. Low diastolic filling volume and respiratory variation of inferior vena cava diameter can be visualized with bedside echocardiography.10 Clinicians may also consider pulmonary artery catheterization and measurement of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which estimates left ventricular end-diastolic volume in the absence of pulmonary hypertension or valvular disease. This patient was successfully treated with diuretics. Ventilation-perfusion scan showed no segmental perfusion defect, and echocardiogram showed no ventricular dyskinesis.  On the fifth postoperative day, the patient was discharged to home in good condition. At his outpatient visit 2 weeks later, he remained free of complications.Oliguria and tachycardia suggest inadequate intravascular fluid volume.Dyspnea and polyuria suggest fluid overload. These are attenuated by age, nutritional status, general anesthesia, and major surgery.7,9Elderly patients often have several comorbid conditions and reduced glomerular filtration rates that, in combination with postoperative inflammation, may mask fluid shifts between intravascular and extravascular compartments.9Serially elevated BNP levels suggest excessive intravascular fluid volume that may be explained by intravenous fluid administration or by physiologic fluid shifts.When the BNP level is less than 100 pg/mL, hypervolemia is unlikely.",JAMA Diagnostic Test Interpretation ,How do you interpret these test results?,male,1463,original,"<answer>

Slitlamp examination of the left eye revealed an elevated bleb over the Ahmed plate with no leakage. The cornea was clear and compact, and there was a well-positioned tube overlying the iris superotemporally. The anterior chamber was deep with trace inflammation. Dilated fundus examination revealed disc edema, peripapillary hemorrhages, and diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages throughout the posterior pole and periphery (Figure 1). Spontaneous venous pulsations were not appreciated.",Order a complete blood cell count and coagulation testing,Oral and topical corticosteroids,Plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome,Fluorescein angiography,Ocular decompression retinopathy,D,Fluorescein angiography,"Retinal hemorrhaging from an acute decrease in IOP was described by Fechtner et al1 after trabeculectomy. It has also been described with other surgeries (glaucoma drainage implants, vitrectomy, orbital decompression, sclerectomy, phacoemulsification, and iridectomy), laser iridotomy, anterior chamber paracentesis, and medical hypotensive therapy.2-4 The mechanism of ocular decompression retinopathy (ODR) is unknown, although theories have been posited. Acute lowering of IOP may increase retinal arterial flow, overwhelming autoregulation, and increasing shearing pressure within capillaries.1-4 Also, a rapid drop in IOP could cause anterior movement of the lamina cribrosa and secondary axoplasmic stasis, nerve edema, and compression of the central retinal vein.2,3 In a study by Jung et al,2 of 688 adult eyes that underwent glaucoma surgery, 21 (3.1%) developed ODR; 1 was found to have fluorescein findings similar to central retinal vein occlusion. Finally, acute lowering of IOP may deform the sclera and change vitreous volume and vitreomacular traction, secondarily compressing, and shearing capillaries.2,5 Fadel et al5 described 13 of 248 pediatric eyes that developed ODR after glaucoma surgery (5.2%), hypothesizing that increased scleral compliance may account for this prevalence.Ocular decompression retinopathy hemorrhages occur in all retinal layers and may exhibit a white center; they can also extend to the subhyaloid and vitreous spaces, rarely necessitating vitrectomy. Optic nerve changes include hyperemia, edema, or hemorrhage. Although the fundus appearance may be dramatic, up to 80% of patients are asymptomatic; otherwise, there may be decreased vision, scotomas, or floaters.2 Because ODR typically occurs in younger, asymptomatic individuals, in cases where central vision has dropped, fluorescein angiography and other imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography, are important in diagnosis and evaluating for retinal edema or ischemia because other causes may present similarly (eg, central retinal vein occlusion).Ocular decompression retinopathy takes 2 to 72 weeks to resolve (mean, 13 weeks),2 and visual acuity returns to baseline in most patients.2,3,5In the series by Jung et al,2 it was found that higher preoperative IOP was associated with ODR, and the degree of postoperative IOP lowering was more influential in ODR development than actual postoperative IOP.2 Therefore, prophylaxis against ODR may include lowering of IOP prior to surgical intervention.Given unilateral findings in an otherwise healthy patient, systemic workup was deferred. However, the drop in central vision necessitated further evaluation. Diffuse retinal hemorrhages without evidence of spontaneous venous pulsations were concerning for central retinal vein occlusion; fluorescein angiography was therefore performed, without characteristic evidence of retinal venous tortuosity, delayed filling, vascular staining, or areas of capillary nonperfusion (Figure 2). The patient was observed, and the hemorrhages resolved within 1 month. Visual acuity returned to baseline within 2 months.Fluorescein angiography of the left eye showed blockage from preretinal and intraretinal hemorrhage yet normal vascular caliber and no evidence of delayed venous filling, as would be seen in acute central retinal vein occlusion.During the following year, IOP elevated in the fellow eye to 40 mm Hg, and an Ahmed tube was implanted. Given his history of ODR, this eye was pretreated with mannitol in the operating room, lowering IOP to 19 mm Hg.

Computed tomography (CT) of the neck with contrast at his initial hospital admission was concerning for suppurative lymphadenitis. Despite incision and drainage, and intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam, his cervical lymphadenopathy persisted. Results of subsequent workup—including Haemophilus, tetanus, and pneumococcal antibody titers; QuantiFERON-TB Gold test; serum IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels; absolute lymphocyte count; neutrophil phenotype and function; angiotensin-converting enzyme level; HLA-B27 test; and antinuclear antibody level—were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck with gadolinium contrast demonstrated bilateral, bulky, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, as well as enhancing nodules in the left laryngeal ventricle (2.3 × 1.6 × 1.2 cm), right false vocal cord, and right tracheal wall (0.6 × 0.4 cm). Findings from nasal endoscopy, awake flexible laryngoscopy, and operative microlaryngoscopy revealed yellow submucosal masses in the left nasal cavity, left laryngeal ventricle, and right trachea, as well as left vocal cord paresis (Figure, A). Biopsies were taken of the tracheal, laryngeal, and nasal cavity masses, and an excisional biopsy was taken of a left cervical lymph node (Figure, B).

B, Hematoxylin-eosin–stained excisional lymph-node specimen at ×1000 magnification revealing histiocytes with central nucleoli and cytoplasm containing intact lymphocytes (emperipolesis).",Rosai-Dorfman disease,Castleman disease,Inflammatory pseudotumor,Sarcoidosis,A. Rosai-Dorfman disease,A,Rosai-Dorfman disease,"Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, was originally described by Rosai and Dorfman in 1969.1 It is a rare, benign, proliferative disease with an unknown cause but is thought to have an association with viral infections, immune-related disorders, and genetic mutations.2,3 It is most frequently seen in children and young adults (mean age, 20 years) with a male predominance of 1.4.4,5 The classic, nodal form most commonly manifests as painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Extranodal involvement occurs in up to 43% of cases and usually affects the skin, soft tissues, central nervous system, and head and neck regions. While symptoms largely depend on location and disease burden, many patients are asymptomatic. A recent study identified 31 known cases of pediatric RDD with head and neck involvement, of which 58% had unifocal disease with a predilection for the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.6 Progressive laryngotracheal involvement, as seen in the current patient, is otherwise extremely rare and, to our knowledge, was previously reported only once.7Given its rare incidence and variable clinical presentations, RDD can present a diagnostic challenge for physicians. Laboratory and radiological findings are often nonspecific, making biopsy necessary for definitive diagnosis of RDD. The nodal form shows large clustered histiocytes with round-to-oval nuclei, open chromatin, and variably distinct nucleoli with voluminous pale cytoplasm. These cells are admixed with an inflammatory infiltrate comprising lymphocytes, plasma cells, and granulocytes. Emperipolesis, the presence of intact lymphocytes within the cytoplasm of the histiocytes, is useful, though not required for diagnosis. Extranodal forms are similar to the nodal type but display more prominent fibrosis, fewer histiocytes, and scant emperipolesis. The RDD histiocytes characteristically stain positive for S100, CD68, and CD163, and negative for CD1a (excluding Langerhans cell histiocytosis).2,5Rosai-Dorfman disease may mimic lymphoma and various inflammatory disorders included in the differential diagnosis. Castleman disease displays similar clinical features to RDD but shows very different histologic findings dependent on whether it is the hyaline vascular or plasma cell variant.8 Inflammatory pseudotumor manifests as nodal or tissue masses composed of reactive lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, histiocytes, spindled fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts; however, histiocytes are negative for S100.9 Sarcoidosis may exhibit cervical lymphadenopathy and mucosal nodules in the nose and larynx but show granulomas and often multinucleated giant cells on microscopic examination.10Following pathologic diagnosis of RDD, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT may be useful for staging evaluation given its sensitivity and specificity for both nodal and extranodal regions. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging is typically recommended over CT scans in children to limit radiation exposure.2 Rosai-Dorfman disease has a variable prognosis, though most patients follow a self-limiting course and do not require treatment.2 A minority of patients, such as this one, exhibit persistent disease associated with mass effects. In such instances, management with corticosteroids, surgical resection, sirolimus, radiation, chemotherapy, or immunomodulatory therapy may be warranted.2 While there are no official treatment guidelines for RDD, routine follow-up is critical to monitor for recurrence.Albeit rare, RDD should be considered in the differential diagnosis for both children and adults with cervical lymphadenopathy and airway lesions. These patients require judicious airway management given the potential for obstruction. Thus, high clinical suspicion, combined with histopathologic evaluation, can aid in a timely diagnosis and ensure appropriate treatment.This patient was initially treated with systemic steroids with considerable improvement. However, owing to substantial weight gain, steroids were stopped, and he had interval recurrence of his laryngeal and tracheal lesions.

However, the appearance is identical to a hypopyon resulting from suppurative infection or inflammation.1 In this patient, AC aspiration was done and showed malignant cells (Figure 2), confirming AML relapse with monocytic differentiation.Cytology of anterior chamber aspirate showing malignant cells confirming intraocular relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (Giemsa stain, original magnification ×40).Leukemia accounts for 34.8% of ocular metastases affecting the retina, choroid, optic nerve, vitreous, iris, and AC.2 Acute leukemias present more frequently with ocular manifestations than in chronic leukemias,3 with ocular involvement ranging from 32% to 35.5%.4 Ocular involvement of the anterior segment specifically due to acute lymphocytic leukemia relapse ranges from 2.5% to 18%, while anterior involvement in AML relapse is very rare.1The differential diagnosis for hypopyon includes 4 broad categories: noninfectious inflammation, infectious, neoplastic, and corneal etiologies.1 Noninfectious causes include uveitis, most commonly HLA B-27–associated or Behçet disease–associated inflammation, and postsurgical or medical-induced inflammation, such as with rifabutin.5 Infectious causes can be exogenous with postsurgical or traumatic inoculation or endogenous, such as endogenous endophthalmitis from hematological spread. Hypopyon due to neoplasia can be caused by leukemia, lymphoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, or metastases. Finally, corneal etiologies include microbial keratitis or noninfectious chemical or traumatic injuries. Recognition on physical examination and proper investigation is crucial for correct diagnosis and treatment, as hypopyon usually occurs with specific conditions rather than as a universal ocular inflammatory response.1Option C, perform AC aspiration (as this can detect neoplastic cells) and inject intravitreal antibiotics, is the correct next step.6-8 Although rare, given this patient’s history of AML, suspicion for infiltrative pseudohypopyon as a mimicker of reactive intraocular inflammation should be raised. However, this patient is immunocompromised with a recent PICC, so an infectious process must be kept on the differential. Broad-spectrum intravitreal antibiotics, such as vancomycin and ceftazidime, should be injected until AC aspiration results return, as the consequences of untreated endophthalmitis are severe.8Option A is incorrect. A 2022 study has shown that ocular inflammation can occur in the weeks following subretinal administration of voretigene neparvovec gene therapy9; however, this patient underwent treatment years ago. Option B, perform vitrectomy, is incorrect as there is not evidence of posterior segment inflammation, the patient’s vision does not meet criteria by the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study, and there are less invasive methods for specimen evaluation. Endophthalmitis can occur in the setting of a blood-borne infection, but awaiting systemic laboratory tests and blood culture results, option D, would not help distinguish between AML pseudohypopyon vs endophthalmitis and would delay endophthalmitis treatment. Additionally, it has been suggested that leukemic pseudohypopyon can be associated with relapse even if leukemia is not systemically detected.10The patient was admitted and started venetoclax combined with fludarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin chemotherapy and received low-dose 1400 cGy involved-field radiotherapy to the eyes for 1 week.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2790987,"A middle-aged patient with a remote history of bilateral juvenile cataracts after posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) placement presented with decreased vision in the right eye for several months. There was no recent ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. At the time of the initial examination, visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a refraction of −1.50 diopters (D) sphere in both eyes. Examination was notable for a superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye. Results of the fundus examination were reported to be normal in both eyes and the anterior examination of the left eye was notable for only a well-positioned PCIOL. The patient was referred to a cornea specialist for further evaluation and treatment.Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, specialty evaluation occurred 10 weeks later at which time the patient complained of progressive vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity measured hand motion in the right eye with normal intraocular pressure. The PCIOL was subluxed inferotemporally with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). A 4 mm × 3.1-mm superonasal pigmented scleral lesion was also noted (Figure 1B). The examination of the left eye was remarkable only for a well-centered PCIOL and iris transillumination defects.A, Slitlamp photography of the right eye showing the inferotemporal intraocular lens implant subluxation (arrowhead).",Perform intraocular lens suture fixation or exchange,Order ultrasound biomicroscopy,Order anterior segment optical coherence tomography,Perform a biopsy of the ocular surface lesion,Intraocular lens implant subluxation and extrascleral extension secondary to ciliochoroidal melanoma,B,Order ultrasound biomicroscopy,"Intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation is an uncommon complication of cataract surgery, estimated to occur after 0.3% to 2.0% of cases.1,2 Risk factors for late postoperative IOL dislocation, defined as dislocation 3 or more months following surgery, include etiologies of zonular weakness such as pseudoexfoliation syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, trauma, high myopia, prior vitreoretinal surgery, and connective tissue diseases.3 Investigations suggest 0.6% of patients with pseudophakia with these risk factors require corrective surgery for dislocations within 10 years of cataract surgery.2 Surgery typically is indicated for decreased visual acuity or lens dislocation-induced retinal detachment, glaucoma, or uveitis.4 Both IOL exchange and suture fixation are potential treatments.3This case involves unilateral PCIOL dislocation in a patient with −1.50 D myopia and no history of trauma, retinitis pigmentosa, or additional intraocular surgery. The etiology of dislocation should be considered before surgery is performed (choice A). Connective tissue diseases can be associated with juvenile cataracts and zonular weakness but are associated with extraocular manifestations, making them less likely in this patient.5 Pseudoexfoliation syndrome can be considered given the iris transillumination defects in the fellow eye, but these can also occur following intraocular surgery.The scleral pigmentation and subluxed IOL in the opposing direction make a ciliary body tumor a consideration. Specifically, the focality, elevation, and vascularity of the lesion are concerning. The lesion should be investigated further with imaging before a biopsy is performed (choice D). Optical coherence tomography is useful for conjunctival tumors but is limited in evaluating pathologies posterior to the iris (choice C). However, ultrasound biomicroscopy should provide a high-resolution image of the PCIOL position and evaluate for ciliary body masses, making choice B the correct answer. Indeed, ultrasound biomicroscopy identified a large ciliary mass displacing the PCIOL (Figure 2).

The intraocular melanoma was not seen at the time the subluxed IOL was initially identified. While most uveal melanomas are now treated with radiation therapy, enucleation is indicated for the largest tumors (largest basal diameter >20 mm, thickness >12 mm).6,7 Following primary treatment, patients with uveal melanoma undergo surveillance for both local and distant recurrence. Unfortunately, the risk for distant metastasis approaches 50% and is elevated with ciliary body location.6 There is currently no curative therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma.6,7Given the tumor size, enucleation of the right eye was performed. Pathology confirmed a mixed-type uveal melanoma. Six months after enucleation, liver metastases were identified, presumably related to presence of micrometastases at the time of initial diagnosis and treatment.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2681948,"A 14-year-old girl was seen with progressive vision loss in both eyes. Two years before our examination, her visual acuity had been 20/200 OD and 20/60 OS. At our initial evaluation, her visual acuity was 20/300 OD and 20/250 OS. Optic nerve atrophy was noted, with no optociliary collaterals. Imaging of the retinal nerve fiber layer showed thinning in both eyes. Automated perimetry demonstrated general constriction of visual fields and bilateral central scotomas. Ocular motility was full, without pain, and orthotropic. Two years prior, initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast was read as normal. Retrospectively, those images were reviewed and noted to be limited due to artifact from dental braces and a lack of fat suppression. Two years prior, lumbar puncture revealed normal opening pressure.Complete blood cell count with differential was negative, as were test results for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption, antinuclear antibody, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and serum neuromyelitis optica antibodies. Whole-exome genome sequencing was negative for genes associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 and type 2. After removal of dental braces, MRI of the brain and orbits with and without contrast demonstrated thickening and nodular enhancement of bilateral perioptic nerve sheaths extending up to the orbital apex. Patchy T2-weighted hyperintensity was noted within the bilateral optic nerves (Figure).A, T1-weighted fat-suppressed image demonstrates thick, nodular, circumferential enhancement in the bilateral optic sheaths. B, T1-weighted postcontrast image shows sparing of the optic chiasm.",Observation,Optic nerve sheath biopsy,Radiotherapy (fractionated external beam radiotherapy),Optic nerve sheath biopsy and radiotherapy,Optic nerve sheath meningioma,C,Radiotherapy (fractionated external beam radiotherapy),"Optic nerve sheath meningioma is a benign neoplasm of the meningothelial cells of the arachnoid tissue around the optic nerve.1 The usual age of presentation is between 30 and 50 years, with a 3:1 female to male ratio.2 Bilateral cases of ONSM are rare but can be seen in 5% of all reported cases.3-6 The optic nerve appearance in patients with ONSM reveals a frank optic atrophy.1-7The ONSM compromises the optic nerve function by causing mass effect on the pial vasculature, ischemic changes, and disruption of the axonal transport along the optic nerve.2 The circumferential relationship between the ONSM and the optic nerve and its vascular supply makes the treatment of ONSM challenging. Surgical excision may result in blindness.2,7 Therefore, fractionated external beam radiotherapy has become preferable, especially when treating bilateral OSNMs, and vision preservation is a priority.8Bilateral ONSMs have an insidious onset, in which vision loss precedes anatomical and radiological findings. The compromise in optic nerve axon function progresses to radiologically evident lesions over the course of months to years. Nickel et al5 reported progressive loss of vision in a 4-year-old child with bilateral ONSMs over a 6-year period. Misra and colleagues6 described bilateral ONSM in a 60-year-old patient who had experienced progressive vision loss since age 7 years and who had been lost to follow-up after radiotherapy.One of the largest ONSM studies was reported by Turbin and associates.8 In that study, 64 adult patients with ONSM comprised the following 4 groups: observation alone, surgery alone, surgery with radiotherapy, and radiotherapy alone. With up to 50 months’ follow-up, 59 of 64 patients (92%) had better than light perception vision: 18 of the 59 (31%) had received radiotherapy alone. For the patients with radiotherapy alone, there was no significant vision loss compared with patients in the other 3 groups.Optic nerve sheath biopsy was not performed due to concern about more severe vision loss. Observation alone for visual acuity and visual field loss was not pursued after tumor board discussion with the patient and her family. A course of radiotherapy was initiated using conformal fractionated techniques (ExacTrac; Brainlab) for maximal normal tissue sparing (fractionated external beam radiotherapy via rapid arc to 50.4 Gy) in 28 fractions administered over a 2-month period. Six months later, her visual acuity was counting fingers OD and 20/300 OS.This case emphasizes the importance of considering ONSM in the differential diagnosis of bilateral optic nerve atrophy in children and teens. It is crucial to understand that the goal of radiotherapy is to halt the progression of the disease. Two years after radiotherapy, the patient’s visual acuity was 20/630 OD and 20/400 OS. Repeated MRI of the brain and orbit showed stability and no further worsening of vision.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits did not show evidence of orbital extension. The patient underwent an incisional biopsy, which revealed extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated tissues on histopathology and immunohistochemistry. A staging computed tomography scan showed no adenopathy elsewhere, and radiation therapy of the orbit was therefore recommended. The patient completed a course of radiation for a total dose of 2400 cGy. Subconjunctival mass in the fornix prior to biopsy.Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma is the most frequent type of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma occurring in the conjunctiva. It typically presents in patients 70 years and older as a slow-growing salmon patch lesion in the fornix, with a slight predominance in women. Its pathogenesis is thought to involve chronic inflammation from antigenic stimulation, infection, or autoimmune processes.1Terrien marginal degeneration is a slowly progressive, commonly bilateral, painless degenerative ectasia of the peripheral cornea, occurring most often in men older than 40 years.2 It is most frequently seen in the superior cornea, where stromal thinning or furrowing with lipid deposition at the leading anterior edge is seen. Vision loss due to irregular against-the-rule astigmatism and, in rare cases, perforations can occur. Treatment options generally entail correction of the astigmatism with a rigid gas permeable contact lens, lamellar keratoplasty, or corneal patch graft if perforation is imminent. While the exact mechanism behind the condition is unknown, inflammation is generally not a prominent feature,3 unlike with Mooren ulcer, although some studies suggest an inflammatory variant.4,5 This case was less typical for Terrien degeneration in that it was completely unilateral and that it eventually developed pronounced inflammation and neovascularization.In cases of lipid keratopathy from corneal neovascularization without another known cause, there have been reports of regression of both vessels and lipids after injections of subconjunctival anti–vascular endothelial growth factor  agents, such as bevacizumab.6 In this patient, this was not the treatment of choice, as the patient had another, more pressing diagnosis that was likely contributing to the corneal findings.In this patient, it is possible that indolent, chronic inflammation from the cornea served as antigenic stimulation for the formation of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma in the adjacent conjunctiva. On the other hand, a paraneoplastic syndrome or secondary lipid deposition from pathologic neovascularization attributable to the extranodal marginal zone lymphoma can also be considered.7 Regardless of the etiology of this atypical corneal degeneration, results from this case highlight the importance of a thorough examination of the ocular surface and fornices.On repeated examinations 2 and 6 months thereafter, his visual acuity improved to 20/25 OD without any evidence of recurrence of the subconjunctival mass.

One week after symptom onset, she remained febrile (maximum temperature, 39.6°C [103.2°F]) and the rash spread to her palms and soles, with some progression to pustules (Figure, left panel). She developed right knee pain, followed by pain in other joints. Two weeks after symptom onset, she presented to a local emergency department, reporting inability to stand due to severe joint pain. Results of tests for sexually transmitted infections and respiratory viruses were negative. She was presumptively diagnosed with a viral illness and discharged home with supportive care. Approximately 3 weeks after symptom onset, she presented to the emergency department again with persistent fever, worsening arthralgia, back pain, and progressive purpuric and pustular rash. Her vital signs were unremarkable. White blood cell count was 12 100/μL (reference range, 4000/μL-10 000/μL), with 84% neutrophils. Urinalysis results and levels of serum electrolytes and liver enzymes were within normal limits.",Inquire about rodent and other animal exposures,Obtain joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures,Test for Borrelia burgdorferi,Test vesicular fluid for enterovirus,Rat bite fever,A,Inquire about rodent and other animal exposures,"The key to the correct diagnosis was symptoms of persistent fever, migratory polyarthralgias, and purpuric rash extending to the palms and soles. When questioned, the patient recalled a rat bite 3 days before symptom onset. Based on this history, pustule fluid and blood were submitted for culture. Blood cultures became positive, and Gram stain revealed filamentous gram-negative bacilli in “nests,” with occasional bulbous swellings. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry failed to identify the organism, but 16S rDNA sequencing identified Streptobacillus moniliformis, the causative agent of rat bite fever. No growth occurred from pustule fluid cultures.Because of the nonspecific presentation of rat bite fever, patients with a high index of clinical suspicion should be carefully questioned for rodent exposure.1 Even without a known exposure, rat bite fever should be considered in patients with an unexplained febrile illness and rash, arthritis, or risk factors such as occupational or recreational exposure to rodents.2 The duration of the patient’s symptoms and absence of oral symptoms made the diagnosis of hand, foot, and mouth disease due to enterovirus unlikely. Although testing for tick-transmitted diseases or joint fluid analysis may eventually be warranted, the next best step is obtaining a thorough history regarding exposure to rodents. This approach improves pretest probability and avoids premature conclusions by developing a focused differential diagnosis based on history and examination.3Rat bite fever is caused by S moniliformis in the United States or Spirillum minus in Asia. S moniliformis is a fastidious, facultatively anaerobic, filamentous gram-negative bacteria that colonizes the oral and nasopharyngeal tracts of rats, mice, squirrels, gerbils, and other rodents. Rat bite fever is not a notifiable disease in the United States, and, while incidence appears low, its precise incidence is unknown.1 However, infections are increasing, especially in children, because of the popularity of rodents as pets.4 Transmission also occurs by ingesting food contaminated by urine of colonized rats, causing a syndrome known as “Haverhill fever.”5Rat bite fever is characterized by fever, chills, headache, and vomiting 3 to 10 days after exposure. Without treatment, fever typically follows a relapsing-remitting pattern. Most patients develop a maculopapular, petechial, or purpuric rash, especially on the extensor surfaces of the extremities and extending to the hands and feet. Lesions can evolve into pustules and hemorrhagic vesicles. Most patients develop migratory polyarthralgias involving both small and large joints.1Rodent bite wounds should be thoroughly cleansed, and antibiotic prophylaxis and tetanus immunization may be warranted if not up to date. Rabies prophylaxis is almost never indicated for small rodent bites.6 Symptoms of rat bite fever can present early, but diagnosis is usually delayed or missed because of poor memory of rodent exposure. Additionally, the nonspecific presentation may mimic viral infections, sexually transmitted infections, drug reactions, and vasculitis.1,7S moniliformis is fastidious, and its growth is inhibited by an anticoagulant used in blood cultures. In this patient, growth occurred in the aerobic blood culture bottle but only on anaerobic solid media. No special incubation or plating strategies were used for the blood cultures, but supplemented culture methods have historically been recommended to identify S moniliformis.1 There should be communication with the microbiology laboratory to optimize the diagnostic approach for patients with suspected rat bite fever. Identification of cultured S moniliformis is challenging, as it may not be present in commercial identification databases. Definitive identification may require specialized biochemical analysis,1 sequencing, or both.Infectious diseases consultation can assist with risk assessment, laboratory communication to optimize testing, and choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy. Penicillin is the treatment of choice when diagnosis is confirmed; cephalosporins and tetracyclines may also be effective. Rat bite fever can be associated with serious complications including endocarditis, hepatitis, nephritis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, and sepsis. When diagnosed, rat bite fever can be successfully treated; however, mortality can reach 13% without treatment.7-10,The patient was initially treated with penicillin and doxycycline empirically. After the diagnosis of rat bite fever, treatment was changed to intravenous penicillin G monotherapy. Transthoracic echocardiography did not reveal valvular vegetations. Persistent back pain prompted magnetic resonance imaging of the spine, which revealed changes consistent with lumbar osteomyelitis.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2499848,"A woman in her 30s presented with 3 weeks of distorted vision in her right eye and a visual field defect in the left eye. This was her first episode, and she denied any pain. Visual acuity was 20/25 + 2 OD and 20/20 OS. Confrontation visual fields detected a superior field defect in the left eye. Pupils, intraocular pressures, and anterior segment examination results were within normal limits. Dilated fundus examination revealed whitening and attenuation of a small arteriole in the inferior arcade of the right eye (Figure, A). Examination of the left eye revealed an inferior branch retinal artery occlusion and a patch of retinal whitening superior to the optic disc approximately one-third disc diameter in size (Figure, B). No Hollenhorst plaques were identified. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated segments of arteriole hyperfluorescence with distal nonperfusion in both eyes (Figure, C). This hyperfluorescence and nonperfusion occurred within straight arteriole segments, not at arteriole bifurcations. The differential diagnosis included systemic lupus erythematosis, polyarteritis nodosa, Behçet disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener disease), acute retinal necrosis, syphilis, and hypercoagulability. An outpatient workup composed of fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption, QuantiFERON–TB Gold (Quest Diagnostics), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody, complete blood cell count, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time was ordered.A, Fundus photograph of the right eye shows subtle whitening and attenuation of an arteriole. B, Left eye illustrates an inferior branch retinal artery occlusion and retinal whitening superior to the optic disc. C, Fluorescein angiography demonstrates hyperfluorescence of an arterial midsegment with distal nonperfusion.The next day, the patient developed severe headaches and presented to the local emergency department. She retained normal sensorium but had decreased hearing bilaterally.",Consult otolaryngology for hearing evaluation,Order an echocardiogram,Order brain magnetic resonance imaging,Order carotid ultrasonography,Susac syndrome,C,Order brain magnetic resonance imaging,"Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with gadolinium was performed and revealed multifocal white matter lesions in the corpus callosum that were best seen on sagittal T2 images. Given the constellation of branch retinal artery occlusion, severe headache, and auditory changes, this was diagnostic for Susac syndrome. Vasculitic workup findings were negative for other causes.Susac syndrome is a rare disorder of the retinal, cochlear, and cerebral microvasculature, with 300 reported cases since its description in 1973.1 Classically defined as a triad of encephalopathy, retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss, it has a predilection for women (3:1) particularly between ages 20 and 40 years.Headache is the most common presenting symptom, occurring in approximately 78% of people.1 Central nervous system involvement manifests as psychiatric disturbances, confusion, and dementia. These symptoms may unfold over weeks to months. Forty percent of cases have evidence of retinal arteritis; however, this increases to 97% throughout the course of disease.1 The prolonged time course, varying neurologic symptoms, and often vague visual symptoms lend Susac syndrome to misdiagnosis. This patient falls into the subset of cases with ophthalmic disease as the initial symptom.This disease is thought to derive from immune-mediated endothelial injury of small arterioles less than 100 µm in diameter as histopathology demonstrates endothelial cell necrosis and anti–endothelial cell antibodies.2 Humoral autoimmunity may take part in the pathogenesis as antiendothelial cell IgG1 and IgM antibodies have been detected in some affected patients.3 However, there are no recommendations for the routine use of these serological tests.All patients with suspected Susac syndrome should receive fluorescein angiography, as it may detect subtle microangiopathy not seen on examination. Egan et al4 suggested that segments of arterial hyperfluorescence represent focal endotheliopathy, which may be invisible on examination, in contrast to other vasculitides. Yellow arterial plaques, called Gass plaques, may develop from lipid leakage from chronically damaged vessel walls. Gass plaques are found distant from arterial bifurcations in contrast to Hollenhorst plaques. Echocardiogram and carotid ultrasonography are unnecessary as these findings are not embolic in nature.Brain magnetic resonance imaging is of utmost importance and should not be delayed by such testing as audiometry. In the context of encephalopathy, corpus callosal lesions are pathognomonic for Susac syndrome, as the diagnosis can be made even without retinal artery occlusions or auditory changes.5 Often called snowballs, these microinfarctions are best seen on sagittal T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. Microinfarctions affecting the internal capsule may also give a string-of-pearls appearance on diffusion-weighted imaging.Corticosteroids, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathiopurine, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis have been used to manage this condition.6 The low incidence of this condition and lack of controlled studies limit the ability to create definitive treatment guidelines.In this patient, systemic steroids were initiated and her symptoms improved.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2606437,"A woman in her 30s noticed a painless left neck mass. She had no history of dysphagia, dyspnea, recent upper respiratory tract infection, injury, or surgery. She also had no weight loss, pain, or fever and had no history of tobacco or alcohol use, radiation exposure, family history of thyroid cancer, and no previous thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function test results were normal. Physical examination revealed a palpable nontender, firm mass and no cervical lymphadenopathy. She had a medical history of high-grade osteosarcoma with areas of leimyosarcoma of the tibia which had been treated with right above-knee amputation and chemotherapy 4 years prior to presentation. She was followed up in the oncology clinic without any recurrence or metastases. Her last visit was 6 months earlier. She was also diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix 2 months earlier and was awaiting surgery. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck revealed a 6.0 × 3.4 × 4.4-cm calcified left thyroid lobe mass (Figure, A). Positron emission tomography–computed tomographic (PET-CT) imaging showed increased uptake in the left thyroid gland. She underwent a left thyroid lobectomy. The neoplastic cells were positive for p53, vimentin, and smooth muscle actin, and negative for S-100, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and CD34 (Figure, B).A, Computed tomographic image reveals a calcified mass (blue arrowhead). B; Left, negative immunostain results for S-100; right, positive immunostain results for vimentin (original magnification ×100).",Thyroid lymphoma,Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma,Osteosarcoma metastasis,Squamous cell carcinoma metastasis,C. Osteosarcoma metastasis,C,Osteosarcoma metastasis,"Pathologic analysis revealed metastatic osteosarcoma in a 6.5-cm mass. The mass showed apparent bony tissue.Metastases to the thyroid gland are reported at autopsy in 1% to 24% of metastatic cancer patients.1,2 The most common sites were kidney, lung, breast, esophagus, and uterus.3-5 Some studies showed that the most common primary tumor for thyroid metastases was lung cancer4,6,7; however, some showed renal cell carcinoma.3,8 Review articles concluded that lung and renal cell carcinomas made up more than 80% of total thyroid gland metastases. Unlike uterine cancer, cancer of the cervix is not a common primary source for thyroid metastasis. Unlike the considerable predominance of primary thyroid cancers in women, some studies have found male,1 some have found female,3 and some studies have found no gender predominance4,5 for metastasis to the thyroid gland.The majority of patients presented with clinical complaints, such as new-onset neck swelling, dysphagia, dysphonia, and cough.8 Clinical differential diagnosis for a rapidly enlarging unilateral thyroid mass includes anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), thyroid lymphoma or sarcoma, metastasis to the thyroid gland, and abscess. Differential diagnosis for pathology should include osteosarcoma, sarcomatoid PDTC, ATC with osseous metaplasia, medullary thyroid carcinoma, spindle epithelial tumor with thymus-like differentiation, and synovial sarcoma.9 The cytological image may be ambiguous and requires histopathological confirmation, supported by immunohistochemical examinations.Sarcomas are derived from mesenchymal cells, such as bone, fat, and muscle. Sarcomas of the thyroid, both primary and metastatic, are rare. Osteosarcomas express vimentin; leiomyosarcomas express vimentin, desmin, and smooth-muscle actin. Unlike PDTC, ATC often displays p53 mutations and does not stain for thyroglobulin and often not vimentin. Osteosarcoma may be positive for p53.Metastases of primary tumors can be divided into 2 categories: synchronous and metachronous. Synchronous indicates that the tumors are detected at the same time as the thyroid metastases, whereas metachronous indicates that the thyroid metastases are detected some time after the primary tumor was detected. The mean interval between discovery of the primary tumor and the thyroid metastases was 5.8 years.8 Our patient presented with thyroid gland metastasis after 4 years of disease-free survival without other metastasis apparent on PET-CT examination.We recommend neck ultrasonography for all thyroid enlargement as a first step for imaging. However, in selected cases, CT or PET-CT may be considered initially if clinical suspicion is high for nonthyroid causes such as metastases.In patients with clinically suspected metastasis to the thyroid gland, core-needle biopsy achieved a significantly higher sensitivity than fine-needle biopsy without any false-negative results.10 In cases of known rare primary malignant abnormality, nontypical ultrasonography features of primary thyroid malignant abnormality, and need for an additional immunohistochemical analysis, core-needle biopsy may be primarily considered.10 In this case, we deferred biopsy considering highly calcified tissue on CT imaging and likelihood of osteosarcoma metastasis with previous history of osteosarcoma.The treatment is surgical excision of the lesion with or without lymph node dissection. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy is also considered in selected cases of local recurrence or concomitant metastases. Surgical treatment was associated with improved survival duration.3 The incidence of surgical complications was very low and did not vary by extent of surgical treatment. The most common surgical complications are injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and incomplete resection of the metastasis. In 1 review,5 no patients had tumor recurrence when margins were negative. In light of these data, subtotal thyroidectomy may be warranted unless there is concern for involvement of the contralateral lobe. However, another review3 found that recurrence was more likely in patients treated with subtotal thyroidectomies (13.3%) vs total thyroidectomies (4.8%).Metastasis of osteosarcoma to the thyroid gland is rare. It is important to consider thyroid metastases in the differential diagnosis in thyroid nodules, especially in patients with a medical history of malignant abnormality and rapidly enlarging thyroid mass.

He had no relevant medical history. On medical examination, a reddish, smooth, superficial nodule with small dimples and a soft consistency that measured approximately 1.5 cm in diameter was seen on the left earlobe (Figure, A). It was not painful to the touch. The patient reported no history of lesions or foreign bodies at this location. A biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B and C).A, Clinical photograph of a pruriginous, reddish tumor on the earlobe. B and C, Histopathologic findings reveal mixed diffuse dermatitis involving the reticular dermis, with small-vessel vasculitis, characteristic sparing of a superficial dermal grenz zone as well as the dilated vessel luminal, and mixed leukocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils involving the full thickness of the vessel wall (hematoxylin-eosin).",Sweet syndrome,Extrafacial granuloma faciale,Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia,Leishmaniasis,B. Extrafacial granuloma faciale,B,Extrafacial granuloma faciale,"The biopsy results revealed a mixed dermal infiltrate with eosinophils, neutrophils, and plasma cells, and a nonleukocytoclastic vasculitic component without epidermal changes. The histologic appearance was compatible with extrafacial granuloma faciale (GF).Granuloma faciale is a chronic, benign, and infrequent inflammatory skin disease of unknown origin. It usually manifests as a solitary reddish-violet plaque on the face, and extrafacial involvement may occur; other potential locations include the ears, scalp, trunk, and limbs.1,2 Lesion size varies from several millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. The lesions are usually smooth on the surface and can often present with superficial telangiectasias and prominent follicular orifices, which sometimes show an orange peel appearance.3 Granuloma faciale can be divided into plaque or nodular types, with the latter being generally resistant to therapy.4In a retrospective analysis of 66 patients with GF, i27 (41.5%) patients presented with a nodule, 25 (38%) had multiple lesions, 6 (9%) had extrafacial involvement alone, and 1 (1.5%) had facial and extrafacial involvement.5 Some studies have included GF in the spectrum of IgG4-related diseases.1-4 Although the precise pathogenesis remains unknown, interferon-γ and increased local production of interleukin 5 may be important mediators.1Granuloma faciale is characterized by a diffuse polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate that mainly affects the upper half of the dermis.5,6 The histologic characteristics of leukocytoclastic vasculitis are more prominent in the beginning, with older lesions tending to have fewer neutrophils and more eosinophils and plasma cells, as well as fibrosis.1 The clinical appearance of GF is distinctive, but the differential diagnosis may include lymphoma, persistent arthropod bite reactions, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia, tumid lupus erythematosus, erythema elevatum diutinum, and various granulomatous disorders.Treatment for this condition is limited. First-line therapies include corticosteroids (intralesional injection or topical), topical use of tacrolimus, or complete surgical removal.Sweet syndrome is characterized by a constellation of clinical symptoms that include high fever and sensitive erythematous cutaneous lesions that are usually painful. Histopathologic results reveal a dense neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. In this case, the patient did not comply with the necessary criteria.7 In contrast, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is characterized by papules or nodules with an angiomatoid aspect and that are predominantly located on the head, especially around the ears. The histopathologic characteristics of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia include abnormal vascular proliferation formed by capillaries grouped around arterial or venous vessels, with lymphocytic infiltrates with eosinophils instead of a mixed dermal infiltrate.8Localized cutaneous leishmaniasis tends to occur in exposed areas of the skin and begins as a pink papule which gets bigger and becomes a nodule or a lesion similar to a plaque. The distinctive differences between GF and leishmaniasis are its clinical presentation and the evolution of the lesion; treatment for leishmaniasis can take months or years. In addition, the histopathologic results include a granulomatous infiltrate in the dermis and the presence of amastigotes in the acute phase of infection.9,10Herein, we present a rare case of nodular extrafacial GF. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion, with no recurrence reported.

On examination he had tenderness in the RIF with a positive Blumberg sign ; blood testing showed leukocyte count 10   450 / μL ( to convert to ×109 / L , multiply by 0.001 ) without any shift , C - reactive protein 1.29 mg / dL ( to convert to nanomoles per liter , multiply by 0.331 ) , and hemoglobin 11.4 g / dL ( to convert to grams per liter , multiply by 10 ) . The Alvarado score was 7 . A transabdominal ultrasonographic scan showed a tubular structure in the RIF consistent with a mildly inflamed appendix and stratification of the appendiceal wall ( 7 mm in the proximal and 11 mm in the appendiceal distal tract ) . A small amount of free fluid was present in the Douglas pouch . A transvaginal ultrasonographic scan confirmed normal intrauterine gestation with a vital embryo . Working diagnosis was uncomplicated appendicitis and initial conservative management was amoxicillin clavulanate because of the potential risks of miscarriage associated with performing an avoidable appendectomy and general anesthesia during early gestation . The patient initially improved and was discharged home 2 days later with an Alvarado score of 4 ; oral antibiotic therapy was continued . Three days later he returned to the emergency department with recurrent pain ; the clinical and ultrasonographic findings were unchanged , without evidence of complicated appendicitis , intra - abdominal fluid collection , or abscess . The Alvarado score was 5 . The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and given intravenous antibiotics . In the next 48 hours the symptoms and pain did not resolve , although inflammatory markers were low and the patient was not septic . The surgeon on call requested an urgent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) investigation ( Figure 1).Magnetic resonance imaging showed the gestational chamber and a normal intrauterine pregnancy as well as the presence of a tubular structure in the right iliac fossa ( RIF ) ( A ) and what appeared to be an inflamed , thickened appendix ( 9.83 mm in the proximal appendix ) ( B ) .",Acute appendicitis,"Salpingitis or sactosalpinx (eg, pyosalpinx or hydrosalpinx)",Heterotopic pregnancy,Nonspecific abdominal pain or pelvic inflammatory disease,C. Heterotopic pregnancy with normal intrauterine gestation and ruptured tubal pregnancy with hemoperitoneum and a normal appendix.,C,Heterotopic pregnancy,"An MRI confirmed a normal intrauterine pregnancy and the presence in the RIF of a tubular structure gradually enlarging from 10 mm in the proximal tract to 14 mm at the level of distal tip, consistent with a thickened, inflamed appendix, with some surrounding free fluid and few enlarged regional lymph nodes.Diagnostic laparoscopy (Video) showed a macroscopically normal appendix with a large hemoperitoneum. The right fallopian tube was bulky and congested, containing a heterotopic pregnancy, which is a rare condition of a simultaneous intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy,1 with signs of internal bleeding (Figure 2). Right salpingectomy was performed. Appendectomy was considered unnecessary and a potential source of intra-abdominal contamination.Ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the right Fallopian tube with surrounding blood clots and fresh blood responsible for the persistent right iliac fossa pain.One week later, ultrasonography confirmed the well-being of the uterine fetus with normal fetal heart rate and fetal movement. This intrauterine pregnancy was successfully delivered full-term.Pain in the RIF and suspected appendicitis in pregnant patients need a reliable diagnostic assessment and careful differential diagnosis, especially in the early weeks of gestation. Initial conservative management with antibiotics is recommended because of the potential risks of miscarriage associated with appendectomy and general anesthesia during early gestation,2,3 but timely surgical management is mandatory if the symptoms do not resolve after initial nonoperative management.4 This case highlights that diagnostic laparoscopy outperforms MRI in certain cases when MRI cannot demonstrate a definitive diagnosis, whereas laparoscopy may have 100% diagnostic accuracy, representing a life-saving tool—both diagnostic and therapeutic—for experienced clinicans.5The presence of a dilated structure in the RIF can also be attributed to a sactosalpinx, which is a dilated fallopian tube owing to retention of secretions (eg, pyosalpinx [pus] or hydrosalpinx [serous or clear fluid]). Pyosalpinx is one of the features of pelvic inflammatory disease. The RIF pain in young women can also be caused by pelvic inflammatory disease or nonspecific abdominal pain, and the differential diagnosis from appendicitis can be challenging and require laparoscopy. The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy in natural conception is estimated to be 1 in 30 000 pregnancies.1 In this case, the intrauterine pregnancy remained intact and a healthy baby was delivered without complications at term. The MRI findings were reported as acute appendicitis. Performing an open appendectomy via the McBurney incision under spinal anesthesia would have not allowed visualization of the ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and timely diagnostic laparoscopy was life-saving.Nonoperative, conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis is largely debated worldwide, with many studies suggesting its safety and efficacy, whereas recent meta-analyses6,7 highlighted surgery as the definitive, 1-time only, treatment with a well-known risk profile. Management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in pregnant patients is even more debated, representing a viable option with an acceptable risk-benefit ratio in such patients.8 Nonetheless, when symptoms are not resolving and/or differential diagnosis is uncertain, diagnostic laparoscopy is the best option for avoiding delays for treating complicated or ruptured appendicitis9 or, as in our case, for diagnosing alternative life-threatening conditions.Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and use of laparoscopy during pregnancy recommend diagnostic laparoscopy when available resources preclude prompt imaging for diagnosis or imaging is inconclusive. The risks of delayed diagnosis should be weighed against the risk of possible laparoscopy with negative findings (ie, diagnostic laparoscopy without positive findings needing further therapeutic action) . The surgeon should be proficient in treating conditions diagnosed at laparoscopy.10",JAMA Surgery Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,male,778,augmented_binary,"<answer>

B , Immediate postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showing enlarged extraocular muscles on the right side ( arrowheads).A computed tomography scan without contrast did not show an acute intracranial hemorrhage and demonstrated diffuse enlargement of the right extraocular muscles . Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with contrast again showed enlargement and abnormal signal of the extraocular muscles on the right ( Figure 1B ) ; there was no evidence of cavernous sinus pathology .",Immediate surgical re-exploration,Emergent angiography,Immediate anticoagulation,Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis,Orbital infarction syndrome,B,Emergent angiography,"In the setting of sudden painless vision loss with ophthalmoplegia and extraocular muscle enlargement immediately after craniotomy, one would be concerned about acute occlusion of the ophthalmic artery and its branches. Although computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging did not show any gross hemorrhage, further neuroimaging with angiography to evaluate the status of the aneurysm clipping, as well as the state of the ophthalmic artery circulation, would be the most appropriate next step.As the intraocular pressure was within normal limits and the patient had negative forced ductions, there was no suggestion of an orbital compartment syndrome that would necessitate a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis at this time. Surgical exploration would not be warranted because of a lack of clear etiology. There was no indication for anticoagulation at this time.The triad of sudden painless severe visual loss, complete ophthalmoplegia, and a fundus examination consistent with a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is highly suggestive of orbital infarction syndrome.1 Orbital infarction results in retinal infarction, choroidal ischemia, and ophthalmoplegia. Ophthalmic artery occlusion alone cannot cause these symptoms because of the extensive anastomoses between the ophthalmic artery and external carotid artery.Orbital infarction syndrome has been reported in the setting of acute hypoperfusion, systemic vasculitides such as giant cell arteritis, and extensive thrombosis secondary to mucormycosis.1 All cases had a characteristic constellation of symptoms including severe vision loss—often NLP—complete ophthalmoplegia, proptosis or orbital congestion, and a fundus examination consistent with a CRAO. Orbital infarction syndrome has been reported postoperatively after intracranial aneurysm clipping and spinal surgery as well as due to orbital cellulitis after transcanalicular dacryocystorhinostomy.2-4 The mechanism for postsurgical orbital infarction syndrome is unclear. A myocutaneous flap is raised in these surgeries for the craniotomy, which may cause indirect or direct pressure on the orbits, resulting in hypoperfusion.2 Other factors speculated to play a role are increased intracranial pressure and systemic hypotension, which may cause relative hypoperfusion to the orbit.Orbital infarction syndrome was likely due to a combination of these factors. Angiography showed intact clipping of the aneurysm as well as patent flow through the ophthalmic artery and its branches (Figure 2A). This suggests the ischemic event must have been transient, though sustained long enough to cause permanent damage. Patients with orbital infarction syndrome can also develop a delayed orbital compartment syndrome. Twelve hours after surgery, our patient had increased proptosis and intraocular ocular pressure of 34 mm Hg, and a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis were performed. On follow-up at 2 weeks, the ophthalmoplegia and orbital congestion had resolved but vision remained NLP. Fundus examination demonstrated a pale nerve, attenuated vessels, and diffuse retinal pigment epithelium clumping (Figure 2B).Postoperative imaging of orbital infarction syndrome.

The lenses can usually be seen in their entirety when the pupil is dilated. The cause of microspherophakia is uncertain, but it has been theorized to result from a lack of tension on the lenticular zonules, which arrests the development of the lens in its rudimentary spherical configuration.1 Microspherophakia has been noted to occur in association with a number of conditions (eg, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Alport syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome), but it can also be seen in isolation or as an autosomal dominant or recessive familial anomaly.2Patients with microspherophakia often have defective accommodation, and the spherical shape of the lenses results in myopia. This patient definitely had lenticular myopia; her axial lengths measured only 21.64 mm OD and 21.41 mm OS, and her keratometry values were 43.34 @ 94° / 46.58 @ 4° OD and 44.32 @ 81° / 46.21 @ 171° OS. In addition to generating lenticular myopia, these abnormal lenses may also narrow the anterior chamber and lead to angle-closure glaucoma, and laser peripheral iridotomy is often recommended early in management.3 The lenses may also dislocate anteriorly, causing a pupillary block.4,5 In cases of a pupillary block in patients with microspherophakia, the status of the zonules is usually uncertain. When the zonules are known to be intact, there are several methods that may aid in shifting the lens posteriorly, including cycloplegia, hyperosmotic agents to shrink the vitreous, and supine positioning.6This patient came to the emergency department having already been dilated by an outside physician and with the lenses entirely in the anterior chambers. She had previously undergone bilateral laser peripheral iridotomy, and her intraocular pressures remained normal. Zonules were not seen at all, so repeated dilation was not a good option in her case, as it might have risked lenticular displacement to the posterior pole. In refractory cases of microspherophakia with anterior lens displacement, lensectomy with vitrectomy, sutured and anterior chamber intraocular lens placement, and glaucoma shunt have been described.6,7 This patient underwent modified small-incision cataract surgery with anterior vitrectomy and the placement of a scleral-sutured intraocular lens with Hoffman pockets in the left eye and, 2 days later, in the right eye. In summary, this case demonstrates the potential for anterior lens dislocation following routine dilation in an adult patient with isolated microspherophakia. Microspherophakia should be in the differential diagnosis for patients with small, rounded lenses and narrow angles. There are various strategies for managing complications associated with microspherophakia. In cases of known microspherophakia, assessment for possible phacodonesis should be part of the ophthalmic examination, and caution should be used with routine dilation.The patient tolerated the procedures well, and the best-corrected visual acuity 1 month later was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS.

At the dermoepidermal junction, there was a lichenoid predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate with interface change. On the basis of the clinical distribution of the eruption and corresponding histopathologic findings, a diagnosis of lichen planus (LP) actinicus was made. The patient was instructed to wear sun block on sun-exposed areas of the body. He was also prescribed clobetasol propionate, 0.05%, ointment with improvement of pruritus and the appearance of LP actinicus.Lichen planus actinicus is a rare subtype of LP that is not commonly seen in the United States. Most reported cases have occurred in individuals with dark complexions of Middle Eastern and Indian descent living in subtropical regions.1,2 Other names commonly used for this condition include actinic LP, summertime actinic lichenoid eruption, LP atrophicus annularis, and LP subtropicalis. The incidence of LP is less than 1% of the total population, whereas LP actinicus has been estimated at 1 case per million inhabitants per year.3There are 4 morphologic variants: annular hyperpigmented, melasma-like, dyschromic, and classic lichenoid. The annular hyperpigmented type is the most common form of LP actinicus and usually presents on the dorsum of the fingers and hands. All forms of LP actinicus are exacerbated by sun exposure and most remit during the winter.4 Our patient presented with both the classic lichenoid and annular hyperpigmented types.Lichen planus actinicus differs from classic LP by presenting in areas of sun-exposed skin, with a predilection for the head, dorsum of the hands, and extensor surfaces of the upper extremities, whereas classic LP usually spares the head and more commonly affects the trunk and the flexural extremities.2 Lichen planus actinicus also exhibits seasonal onset in the spring and summer, whereas classic LP reveals no seasonal predilection. The Koebner response is not commonly found in LP actinicus.4 Treatment consists of strict sun protection in conjunction with potent topical corticosteroids.

Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor,D,Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor,"Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are uncommon odontogenic neoplasms with a highly characteristic clinical presentation.1,2 Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors typically present in the second decade of life and are given the epithet two-thirds tumor because approximately two-thirds of cases occur in women, approximately two-thirds of cases present in the maxilla, and approximately two-thirds of cases are associated with an impacted canine. When associated with an impacted tooth, the radiolucency frequently encompasses the entire tooth, as in the case of the present patient. This radiographic finding is rather unique and stands as a distinguishing feature from the majority of radiolucencies associated with impacted teeth, which are pericoronal (ie, specifically around the crown and not the roots of an impacted tooth). These usually represent hyperplastic dental follicles or dentigerous cysts.Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are benign and slow growing but locally expansile. They typically range in size from 2 to 3 cm, though larger lesions have been reported. Presentation with pain is infrequent and is likely owing to large size. Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors may also occasionally occur in the gingival soft tissues, although this is less common.3 Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are treated conservatively with enucleation and curettage, and recurrence is rare; a review of the literature by Philipsen et al4 identified 3 recurrences in 750 documented cases.The name adenomatoid odontogenic tumor is derived from the characteristic histopathologic features,5 as illustrated in the present case. The histopathologic findings consist of a neoplastic proliferation of whorls and strands of odontogenic epithelium that can be variably solid or cystic. The name adenomatoid refers to the ductlike or rosettelike structures seen invariably in a majority of adenomatoid odontogenic tumors. Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are thickly encapsulated in all cases, and this likely accounts for the minimal recurrence rates following conservative excision. Areas resembling calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor may be seen within adenomatoid odontogenic tumors in approximately 25% of cases and are of no prognostic importance because these hybrid neoplasms are not associated with the more aggressive behavior characteristic of calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumors.6 Recently, KRAS mutations have been identified in 71% of adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, indicating a role for mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation in the development of these neoplasms.7While the demographic and clinical presentation of the present case is strongly suggestive of an adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, other more common odontogenic cysts and neoplasms should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The dentigerous cyst is a common sequela of tooth impaction and represents a hyperplasia of epithelial and mesenchymal tissues involved in odontogenesis. Classically, this disease process is pericoronal.8 Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (odontogenic keratocyst) and ameloblastoma are 2 of the most common and most aggressive benign odontogenic neoplasms and are characterized by PTCH1 and BRAF mutations, respectively.9,10 These present as radiolucencies that may or may not be associated with an impacted tooth, mimicking dentigerous cyst; their predilection is for the posterior mandible, but they may involve any portion of the jaws. These conditions require more aggressive surgical treatment, and diagnostic confirmation via biopsy is necessary to plan optimal surgical management. The present patient underwent successful conservative excision of the mass with no complications, and at 9-month follow-up, has demonstrated no sign of recurrence or adverse events related to surgery.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,male,296,augmented_binary,"<answer>

Branchio-oto-renal syndrome,B,Branchio-oto-renal syndrome,"The skin-colored papule on the patient’s ear was consistent with an accessory tragus and the location and history of the lesion on the right lateral neck made it likely to be a branchial cleft cyst, fistula, or remnant. Based on the likely branchial cleft cyst, renal abnormalities, and ear findings, branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome was suspected. The patient underwent ultrasonography of the neck, which revealed a cutaneous tract or fistula extending to the subcutaneous tissues of the neck and likely to the hypopharynx or esophagus. Results of abdominal ultrasonography revealed small kidneys with increased echogenicity. The kidneys measured 4.3 cm and 3.9 cm in length (normal for the patient’s age, 6.2 cm). Nephrology evaluation supported the diagnosis of BOR syndrome. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were normal and no additional renal testing was completed.Branchio-oto-renal syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous developmental disorder characterized by ear, renal, and branchial anomalies. It accounts for an estimated 2% of cases of congenital deafness, with an incidence of 1 in 40 000.1 The most common features of BOR syndrome include hearing impairment, auricular malformation, branchial fistulae or cysts, preauricular sinuses or ear pits, and renal abnormalities.2 Renal anomalies range from mild hypoplasia to aplasia and agenesis.3-5 Hearing loss in BOR syndrome is progressive and may be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed.3 Some branchial anomalies are asymptomatic, but symptomatic branchial cleft fistulae often present with recurrent infections.6Major diagnostic criteria for BOR syndrome include branchial abnormalities, hearing deficit, preauricular pits, and renal abnormalities. Minor criteria include external, middle, or internal ear abnormalities; preauricular tags; facial asymmetry; and palate abnormalities. For a diagnosis of BOR syndrome, an individual must have a minimum of either 3 major criteria or 2 major criteria and 2 minor criteria.7 The diagnosis may also be considered in an individual with any of these abnormalities and a family history of possible BOR syndrome.7 Other findings reported in BOR syndrome include lacrimal duct stenosis, retrognathia, facial nerve palsy, and pancreatic duplication cysts.3,4Most often, BOR syndrome results from mutations in the EYA1 gene (OMIM 601653), located on chromosome 8, and is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern.8 Mutations in the SIX5 gene (OMIM 600963) are also associated, although much less frequently.9 Proteins encoded by the EYA1 and SIX genes form a complex that activates DNA transcription, and mutations in these genes disrupt complex formation.9 Transcription activation by the EYA1 and SIX proteins is involved in the development of fetal tissues of the second branchial arch, from which the neck, eyes, ears, and kidneys are derived. In roughly 40% of individuals meeting the criteria for BOR syndrome, EYA1 mutations are present.7 Most of these mutations can be detected by gene sequence analysis, but approximately 20% are owing to chromosomal rearrangements of EYA1 and require more advanced testing.7There have been cases of misdiagnosis of BOR syndrome as Alport syndrome, owing to clinical similarities between the 2 conditions.4 Alport syndrome is caused by defective type 4 collagen and presents during the first decade of life with hematuria, hearing loss, and ophthalmologic abnormalities.10 Hearing loss in patients with Alport syndrome tends to present during mid-childhood to late childhood rather than in infancy.10Goldenhar syndrome and papillorenal syndrome were also included in the differential. Papillorenal syndrome is characterized by optic disc dysplasia and renal hypoplasia; this diagnosis would not explain our patient’s auricular findings. Goldenhar syndrome typically presents with auricular malformations, bony spinal deformities, hemifacial microsomia, and benign growths of the eye.Families may not seek medical attention immediately if a child is not experiencing significant functional deficits secondary to the condition, as was the case with this 8-month-old patient.

The patient reported that her father was previously diagnosed as having factor V Leiden mutation after a branch retinal vein occlusion was diagnosed at 48 years of age.Globally, the prevalence of CRVO is 0.8% and increases from 0.027% to 0.5% from the fourth to eighth decade of life.3 Individuals younger than 50 years of age make up less than 20% of cases.4Review of medical and family history may be necessary in young adults with CRVO and diagnostic testing may be performed to assess for systemic disease.2 Although not proof of causality, associated systemic disease was found in 40% to 67% of young adults with CRVO.4,5 Inquiry might include hereditary thrombophilias, blood dyscrasias, autoimmune disease, and HIV.4 Pregnancy, use of OCPs, hormone therapy, and diuretics also might be considered.1,4,6 Dehydration has been implicated in some reports of young patients with CRVO.7,8 Assessment also might include measurement of blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, complete blood cell count, lipid profile, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.9 Diagnostic studies, often performed by the primary care physician, may include HIV and pregnancy tests, coagulation panel, and autoimmune markers,4 although the risk to benefit ratio of these workups has not been elucidated.Thrombophilias, including resistance to activated protein C, antiphospholipid antibodies, factor XII deficiency, and anticoagulant protein deficiencies, have been associated with CRVO in young patients.6 These disorders, however, are not rare in the general population without CRVO, raising the possibility that CRVO is unrelated when reported in association with these abnormalities. Factor V Leiden mutation is found in 5% of the general population and 7.9% of those with retinal vein occlusion.10Oral contraception is also associated with CRVO. More than 20% of patients with perfused CRVO and younger than 45 years used OCPs,1 although it could be that a matched control group would have a similar percentage of OCP users. Thus, the risk to benefit ratio of recommending that individuals with CRVOs not commence OCPs remains unknown. Discontinuation of OCPs after CRVO probably should be decided on a case-by-case basis.9Our patient’s primary care physician was informed of the CRVO to consider with any management of factor V Leiden mutation. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents are not routinely prescribed after diagnosis of CRVO as a first thrombotic event in those with factor V Leiden mutation because of the unknown risk to benefit ratio. Our patient discontinued OCPs, after discussion about risks and benefits, and started aspirin, although the precise risk to benefit ratio of this management is not known.

Nodular amyloid,D,Nodular amyloid,"The biopsy specimen demonstrated large amounts of globular eosinophilic material in the dermis that contrasts sharply with brighter pink collagen bundles and scattered plasma cells. Positive Congo red stain results confirmed the presence of amyloid protein (Figure, B and C).The patient underwent an extensive evaluation for hematological malignant abnormalities in coordination with hematology/oncology specialists as well as assessment of cardiac and renal involvement. Serum protein electrophoresis results were negative for paraprotein although κ and λ were elevated. A complete blood cell count with differential, urinalysis, metabolic panel, and liver function test results were normal. Echocardiogram results were unremarkable. He will be followed up by dermatology and hematology specialists to monitor for clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic disease.Primary cutaneous nodular amyloidosis is a rare disorder characterized by the localized accumulation of light-chain amyloid protein, secreted by lesional plasma cells. This is in contrast to the more common cutaneous lichen and macular amyloidosis, in which the amyloid protein derives from keratin.The morphological presentation of nodular amyloidosis is that of localized, waxy, infiltrated nodules or plaques with typical distribution of lower extremities, face, scalp, and genitals. Lesions are typically asymptomatic but can be pruritic.1 Because the clinical and pathological appearance of nodular amyloidosis can be indistinguishable from that of systemic amyloidosis, systemic involvement must be excluded in order to make the correct diagnosis. Systemic amyloidosis can result in a restrictive cardiomyopathy, proteinuria up to nephrotic range, hepatomegaly, as well as peripheral and autonomic neuropathy.2Even when distinguished from systemic amyloid, patients with localized disease require continued monitoring owing to the possibility of progression to systemic involvement. While early studies estimated this risk at around 50%, larger and more recent case series have shown progression to occur in roughly 7% of patients.1 The disease has been more rarely associated with other concomitant indolent hematologic malignant diseases.3 In addition to malignant abnormality, nodular amyloid has been reported to occur with systemic autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren syndrome and limited scleroderma.4,5Several reports have attempted to determine the clonality of plasma cells in nodular amyloid lesions. Plasma cells appear to be clonal; except in cases associated with Sjogren syndrome where both monoclonal and polyclonal infiltrates have been described.4,6 In monoclonal cases, nodular amyloid can be thought of as etiopathogenically similar plasmacytoma, with nodular amyloidosis displaying a much sparser plasma cell infiltrate but one in which the cells have a much greater secretory capacity.Nodular amyloidosis can also be understood as a manifestation of a group of disorders characterized by isolated, tissue-specific deposition of amyloid, typically of light-chain composition, by local collections of secretory monoclonal plasma cells. These disorders, referred to as amyloidomas, have been shown to occur in the central nervous system, bone, as well as a variety of levels within the respiratory and genitourinary tracts.7,8Given the rarity of cases, no standard modality exists for treatment of nodular amyloidosis.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2796096,"A woman in her mid-50s with a history of mitral valve repair presented to the emergency department with complaints of recent - onset palpitation within the last hour . On physical examination , the patient showed a rhythmic tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats / min and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg . The 12 - lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats / min ; no obvious P waves were recognizable ( Figure 1A ) . The QRS complexes displayed 2 different morphologies occurring with a definite allorhythmic distribution : pairs of beats exhibiting complete right bundle branch block ( RBBB ) and QRS duration of 140 milliseconds followed by a third beat with normal configuration and QRS duration of 70 milliseconds . This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained . Adenosine administration quickly slowed the ventricular rate allowing recognition of an atrial tachycardia with a rate of 178 / min and a 2:1 atrioventricular ( AV ) ratio ( Figure 1B).A , Regular supraventricular tachycardia with right bundle branch block aberration disappearing every third beat . B , Lead II . Numbers within the tracing indicate the R - R intervals ( in milliseconds ) .

The medical history strongly suggests a macroreentrant circuit (macroreentrant atrial tachycardia, also called atypical atrial flutter) developing around the atriotomy scar related to mitral valve surgery, possibly a left-sided atrial flutter such as mitral annular flutter. The R-R interval prolongation due to the shift from 1:1 to 2:1 AV ratio restored the normal right bundle branch conduction resulting in narrow QRS complexes. This supports an intermittent phase 3 RBBB. The most challenging issue in the tracing on presentation is the periodic disappearance of the RBBB aberration. The key to the correct diagnosis is the unexpected normalization of the QRS morphology occurring periodically, every third beat, despite constant cycle lengths.1-4A pattern of complete bundle branch block does not necessarily imply a total interruption of conduction in the affected bundle branch but can also result from a delay exceeding the time required for activation from the contralateral bundle branch (accepted critical delay: 40-60 milliseconds).3 In a Wenckebach series, whenever the opening beat is normally conducted whereas complete bundle branch block occurs in the second impulse, progressive conduction delays in later beats and final failure do not further affect QRS morphology and width: the bundle branch Wenckebach phenomenon, therefore, is “incompletely concealed” being inapparent on ECG only from the second to the closing beat of each sequence.3,4 As illustrated schematically in Figure 2, while the conduction through the left bundle branch is normal, the right bundle branch shows increasingly impaired conduction owing to an area of refractoriness leading to progressive prolongation of the conduction time, until a block occurs in the third impulse of each Wenckebach series. Impulse 1 conducts down both bundle branches normally (conduction time: 40 milliseconds), resulting in narrow QRS. Impulse 2 penetrates the critical area within the right bundle branch with delayed conduction (right bundle conduction time: 90 milliseconds). Although a complete block in the right bundle branch does not occur, the delayed conduction results in ventricular depolarization via the left bundle branch, resulting in a complete RBBB pattern. Impulse 3 represents further impaired conduction and a true block in the right bundle branch. The proximal bidirectional block during the third impulse of each Wenckebach sequence doubles the effective cycle length of the right bundle branch, increasing its recovery time to 2 R-R intervals, thereby allowing normal conduction of impulse 4. This prolonged cycle length, furthermore, extends the right bundle refractory period following the normalized beat so that the second impulse of the next Wenckebach sequence once again conducts with RBBB aberration, and the mechanism then repeats.1,2 Accordingly, the Wenckebach phenomenon in the right bundle branch is incompletely concealed and is evident only on the first to second beats.3,4 Incompletely concealed Wenckebach-type block in a bundle branch was first postulated by Rosenbaum in 1969 in order to explain periodical improvements of aberrant conduction unrelated to changes in cycle length.3Schematic explanation of the behavior of intraventricular conduction. Numbers above the strip are the R-R intervals. An area of refractoriness within the right bundle results in progressively impaired conduction (red: normal conduction; gray: delayed conduction; black: conduction failure). Concealed 3:2 Wenckebach-type conduction occurs over the right bundle branch. CT indicates conduction time (in milliseconds); LB, left bundle, RB, right bundle.Alternate explanations are less convincing. Disappearance of the RBBB pattern every third beat theoretically could reflect fusion of supraventricular impulses with trigeminal right ventricular extrasystoles. However, a regular repetition of such ectopics in a fixed trigeminal rhythm with perfect synchronization with atrial impulses is unlikely; furthermore, no ventricular extrasystoles were evidenced throughout the tracing.1,2 The findings in this ECG are compatible with a 3:1 RBBB. However, such a high conduction ratio in a bundle branch is extremely rare especially in a repetitive fashion. Moreover, in order to invoke a 3:1 RBBB, a very long right bundle branch refractory period, extending over 2 cardiac cycles (>675 milliseconds), has to be assumed. Nevertheless, as the rate slows with adenosine and normal right bundle conduction resumes, some R-R intervals measuring 630 to 670 milliseconds occur (Figure 1B), which excludes this possibility.3,4Although the conduction disturbance may have been the result of mitral valve surgery, a Wenckebach-type bundle branch block occurring at fast rates does not necessarily indicate a damaged conduction system, but may represent merely a functional, phase 3 delay in the distal His-Purkinje system.1 Amiodarone infusion restored sinus rhythm, leading to persistent normalization of intraventricular conduction. Given the very recent onset of tachycardia and the low risk of stroke, postcardioversion anticoagulation was omitted.5,6 No recurrence of atrial flutter and/or RBBB was documented over a 1-year follow-up while receiving oral amiodarone.",JAMA Cardiology Clinical Challenge ,ECG indicates electrocardiogram.Place a temporary pacemaker and start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone What Would You Do Next?,female,131,augmented_binary,"<answer>

Necrotizing scleritis is a rare complication of ophthalmic surgery that typically presents as a focal area of intense scleral inflammation at the site of a previous surgery.1 It is thought to be a local autoimmune reaction and can be associated with systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, thyroid disease, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Histology of involved sclera shows a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, the nature of which is not fully understood.2,3 One theory is that surgical trauma exposes antigens from a normally immune-privileged site; following surgery, the immune system may produce antibodies to these newly exposed antigens. Exudative retinal detachment with necrotizing scleritis associated with surgery is very rare.4Necrotizing scleritis associated with surgery is more likely to occur after multiple surgeries, and while it can occur in the immediate postoperative period, it may manifest months and even decades later.5-7 In a large case series, the mean onset was 9 months after surgery in patients with a history of 2 or more ocular surgeries and 9.5 years in patients with only 1 ocular procedure.2 Management typically requires systemic immunosuppression. Patients may be started on prednisone at 1 mg/kg/d, followed by a steroid-sparing agent.8 Surgical reinforcement of scleral thinning may be required to prevent globe perforation.9For this patient, fortified antibiotics (choice A) would not be recommended, because he was already receiving topical antibiotics. Topical steroids and cycloplegia (choice B) would be insufficient treatment, given the severity of inflammation. Systemic steroids and outpatient follow-up (choice C) would be inappropriate in this patient because of his previous uncontrolled blood glucose levels while receiving oral prednisone. There is an established association between aggressive early systemic immunosuppression and a favorable visual acuity prognosis in necrotizing scleritis associated with surgery. Immunosuppression initiated within 1 month of scleritis onset seems to improve visual acuity prognosis, whereas initiation of immunosuppression after 3 months is associated with worse visual acuity outcomes.1This patient was admitted and started receiving oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/d. A rheumatology consult was requested, and an extensive autoimmune and infectious workup had negative results, including cultures and tests for quantiferon gold, syphilis IgG, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, lysosomes, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibody, and rheumatoid factor.

His visual acuity improved to 20/200 OS, but his visual acuity prognosis was guarded because of the delay between symptom onset and initiation of systemic immunosuppression, which resulted in a likely long-standing exudative retinal detachment. He continues to be followed up as an outpatient.Slitlamp photograph of the left eye demonstrates residual scleromalacia.

Perform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation",D,"Perform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation","The pathological findings of the patient’s CT-guided biopsy were compatible with inflammation or SLR. The main feature of this patient was the mild presenting symptom but with the rapid development of consolidated lung with interstitial pneumonia on his CT scan. The diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was rejected because the patient had a dry cough only, and findings of bronchial washings were negative. Disease recurrence was considered, but the decreasing carcinoembryonic antigen levels  seemed inconsistent. Although a similar CT finding can be found in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)–induced interstitial lung disease (ILD), the mild symptom was incompatible with this diagnosis. There was no direct evidence to support the change of treatment to chemotherapy or steroids. With this in mind, clinicians must consider rebiopsy, and the diagnosis of the SLR was compatible with clinical symptoms and CT findings.Cancer-associated SLR is characterized by epithelioid cell granulomas with T-cell infiltration in pathologic findings (Figure, B) and observed in patients with hematological malignancies or solid tumors. In contrast to sarcoidosis with systemic involvement, cancer-associated SLR is usually asymptomatic, and the incidence of SLR lymphadenopathy in lung cancer ranges from 1.3% to 11%.1 Sarcoid-like reaction with ground-glass pulmonary infiltrates or lung consolidation is rare. Although fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is useful for evaluating the recurrence of lung cancer, it has been reported to produce false-positive results in cases of SLR.2Sarcoid-like reactions  are elicited by antigenic factors released from the tumor cells and are mostly identified in the lymph nodes draining a malignant tumor. These antigenic factors may be either shed by the tumor cells or released during tumor necrosis. Therefore, such reactions can be identified at diagnosis or after chemotherapy and immunotherapy.3 In infiltrating tumors, the production of interferon gamma by local natural killer cells and T cells activates the dendritic cells, which then present the antigen to naive CD4+ T cells, converting them into T helper 1 cells and contributing to the maturation of macrophages and granuloma formation. In an observational cohort study of 127 patients with lung cancer undergoing curative resection, 19 (14.9%) had coexistent granulomatous inflammation in the resected specimen.1 Some treatments for cancer may produce necrotic material or metabolic substances and induce granulomatosis, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for bladder cancer and interleukin-2 treatment for kidney cell carcinoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed the therapeutic landscape for lung cancer, and several reports have described the development of SLRs after the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 inhibitors.4 Assessing the expression of programmed cell death (PD) 1 and PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients receiving nivolumab therapy, a recent study showed that an elevated expression of PD-L1 sequential to blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction can be associated with SLRs.5Although SLRs have been reported in patients receiving chemotherapy and immunotherapy, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a pulmonary consolidation pattern in a patient with ROS1 rearrangement receiving an anaplastic lymphoma kinase/ROS1 inhibitor. Sarcoid-like reactions often respond to corticosteroid treatment and do not require the discontinuation of treatment. Conversely, in TKI-induced ILDs, the destroyed endothelium of alveolar vessels or pneumocytes leads to the release of cytokines and the recruitment of more inflammatory cells that, in turn, induce more damage to the endothelial cells.6 Deaths associated with TKI-induced ILD have been reported, and permanent discontinuation of TKIs is required in severe cases.In this case, while the patient’s dry cough was not severe, he decided to halt his crizotinib use. He further refused steroid use and asked to resume the ceritinib treatment. His dry cough improved substantially, and the lung consolidation lesion subsequently decreased (Figure, B). In conclusion, in cases involving a radiological pattern of disease progression, such as a new lung consolidation lesion associated with TKI use, our article suggests that a routine rebiopsy is needed to confirm the SLR and avoid misinterpretation.",JAMA Oncology Clinical Challenge ,"The CT scan after resuming ceritinib treatment for 2 months showed decreased lung consolidation and the primary tumor (yellow arrowhead).Treat with chemotherapy for disease recurrence because the agents available for recurrent ROS1 tumors remain limitedAdminister antibiotics with coverage for pneumonia pathogen for 7 to 10 days and a repeated CT scan in 4 weeksAdminister steroid treatment and discontinue crizotinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) permanently because TKI-induced interstitial lung disease is highly suspectedPerform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation What Is Your Diagnosis?",female,301,augmented_binary,"<answer>

Acute renal impairment in this setting is highly indicative of cast nephropathy, and renal biopsy should not delay treatment. Although hydration is imperative, furosemide may worsen cast nephropathy and should be avoided.2 Patients presenting with multiple myeloma and acute renal impairment attributed to cast nephropathy should urgently receive bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy to suppress light-chain production, with consideration of simultaneous mechanical removal of FLCs, to optimize renal recovery.According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG),3 this patient meets criteria for active multiple myeloma reflected by clonal bone marrow plasma cells 10% or greater and by a serum involved to uninvolved FLC ratio greater than 100, qualifying as a myeloma-defining event. Specifically, evidence of end-organ damage (CRAB criteria: hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, bone lesions) is no longer exclusively required to diagnose multiple myeloma.3 For patients previously categorized as having smoldering myeloma, the inclusion of myeloma-defining events allows for earlier recognition of patients at high risk for progression who would benefit from early intervention.Renal impairment is one of the most common complications of multiple myeloma, with risk proportional to urinary FLC concentration.4 In this patient, urinary FLCs could not be confirmed prior to initiation of therapy, although urinalysis at admission did show significant nonalbumin proteinuria. This, along with serum κ FLC concentration greater than 500 mg/L, strongly suggested cast nephropathy, circumventing the need for renal biopsy.5 Acute renal impairment in this setting is a medical emergency, warranting rapid initiation of antimyeloma therapy to reduce circulating FLCs and restore renal function, because dialysis dependence confers increased mortality.6On recognition of multiple myeloma–related renal impairment, aggressive hydration should be initiated, hypercalcemia corrected, and nephrotoxic agents avoided.5 The IMWG recommends prompt initiation of antimyeloma treatment with bortezomib-based regimens, as several studies have demonstrated superior renal recovery and rates of dialysis independence5,7 (grade A recommendation). The IMWG also recommends high-dose dexamethasone for at least the first month of therapy (grade B)5 for more rapid renal responses.7 Although immunomodulatory drugs such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide are options, these may require renal dosing and can be less effective in this setting.5 Thus, for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who have acute renal impairment, bortezomib-dexamethasone–based regimens are considered first-line therapy. More recently, bortezomib-dexamethasone plus another agent (triplet therapy) has demonstrated superior renal outcomes, including higher rates of dialysis discontinuation, resulting in improved survival.8Mechanical approaches, such as high-cutoff hemodialysis (HCO-HD) or plasma exchange, are occasionally used in conjunction with systemic antimyeloma therapy to rapidly remove FLCs from circulation. Of these, data supporting HCO-HD, which allows FLC removal through large pores, are more promising for reversal of renal impairment and dialysis independence.9 The evidence supporting plasmapheresis is controversial, limited by small trials with conflicting outcomes.5 Randomized clinical trials are ongoing to better define the role of adjunctive mechanical approaches for patients with myeloma-related renal impairment requiring dialysis. According to IMWG guidelines in 2016, in patients with multiple myeloma and acute renal impairment strongly suspected to have light chain cast nephropathy, HCO-HD should be attempted first (grade B). If unavailable, plasma exchange is a reasonable alternative (grade C).5This case highlights a recent shift in the diagnostic criteria for active multiple myeloma and offers an opportunity to discuss specific management options for myeloma-related renal impairment.The patient received bortezomib-dexamethasone plus 3 cycles of plasmapheresis, with lowering of serum FLC level and improvement in urine output. There was significant recovery of renal function; dialysis was reduced to twice weekly after 3 months of antimyeloma therapy and was no longer required after 6 months.",JAMA Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,female,941,augmented_binary,"<answer>

The shape of the opacity was similar to the trunk of the MPA and showed alternating expansion and contraction during the cardiac cycle. The opening and closing of the pulmonary valve were visible at the inferior part of the translucent shadow (Figure; Video). This was diagnosed as a large pulmonary artery air embolism in the MPA.Pericardial effusion leading to pericardial tamponade is a rare complication of BMV. However, acute tamponade is accompanied by hypotension. Also, on fluoroscopy, tamponade will appear as a decreased movement of cardiac borders along with separation of visceral and parietal pericardium due to accumulation of blood, which was not present in this case. Hence, pericardiocentesis was not indicated. Acute massive pulmonary thromboembolism in the MPA gives rise to acute-onset hypotension and dyspnea, but fluoroscopy is usually unremarkable. Rarely, fluoroscopy may show a prominent pulmonary artery, an enlarged right descending pulmonary artery (Palla sign), an abrupt cutoff of vessels, elevated hemidiaphragm along with focal pulmonary oligemia (Westermark sign), and peripheral, pleural-based, wedge-shaped opacity (Hampton hump) due to pulmonary infarction. Acute pulmonary embolism appears as a filling defect on contrast angiography rather than on fluoroscopy. As none of these features was present, intravenous thrombolytic and catheter-directed embolectomy were not indicated in this patient.Massive pulmonary artery air embolism was previously described among patients who were undergoing pacemaker implantation.1 The most common risk factors for air embolism during an intervention are dehydration, low central venous pressure, coughing, deep inspiration, old age, use of a large central venous sheath, and deep sedation. The symptoms of an air embolism can be asymptomatic to life-threatening depending on its size.2 If an air embolism occurs with resulting hypotension, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be started immediately. Patients should be given 100% oxygen and intravenous fluids, along with inotropic support and cardiopulmonary resuscitation as needed.2 Recently, the Durant maneuver (left lateral decubitus position) has been described for the management of air embolism in preference to the Trendelenburg position. In rare cases, the use of a catheter has been described for the suction of air from the pulmonary artery.3The BMV procedure was stopped immediately, and the patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position and started treatment with 100% oxygen and intravenous fluids. A decision was made to remove the air in the MPA using Judkins right coronary catheter, but the air embolus was absorbed within 3 to 4 minutes with the medical management alone.

Laboratory findings were notable only for a troponin T level of 2.41 ng / mL ( to convert to micrograms per liter , multiply by 1 ) . An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and a point - of - care transthoracic echocardiogram ( TTE ) were obtained ( Figure 1 ; Video ) .",Cardiac catheterization,Computed tomography of the head,Pulmonary computed tomography angiography,Transesophageal echocardiography,Neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy,B,Computed tomography of the head,"Elevated cardiac enzyme levels, ST-segment depression in the precordial leads on the ECG (Figure 1A), and regional wall motion abnormalities on TTE (Figure 1B; Video) were all concerning for an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cardiac arrest. A cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography could be considered after the return of spontaneous circulation. Nevertheless, there were also important discriminating imaging features in the TTE that could suggest another diagnosis; the wall motion abnormality only involved the midventricular wall, without involvement of the basal or apical segments of the left ventricle. The midventricular (hypokinetic) and apical/basal (hyperkinetic) segments exhibited a discrepant contractile pattern. This “spindle-shaped” ventricular contractile dysfunction was not consistent with the myocardial territory of a single coronary artery. Taking her manifestation and unique imaging findings into account, we gave priority to a computed tomography of the head, which showed a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with an intraventricular extension (Figure 2). Therefore, neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy (NSC) was diagnosed. Given her history of deep vein thrombosis, a pulmonary embolism could possibly cause pulseless electrical activity and new-onset atrial fibrillation. However, the characteristic TTE findings prompted us to seek a different diagnosis, and performing pulmonary computed tomography angiography was not the first choice. A transesophageal echocardiography might improve the visualization of intracardiac anatomic structures, but it is unlikely that it would offer further diagnostic help.Computed tomography image of the head showing a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (asterisks) with intraventricular extension.Intracranial hemorrhage, particularly SAH, is the leading cause of NSC. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can occur acutely and improve spontaneously over days to weeks. Neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy is thought to be caused by hemorrhage, ischemia, or edema of the hypothalamus, which stimulates the release of endogenous catecholamine and results in an extensive spasm of the systemic arteries, including the coronary arteries.1 In contrast to classical stress-induced cardiomyopathy, or Takotsubo syndrome, which is often associated with an LV “apical ballooning” pattern, NSC more commonly causes an “inverse” contractile dysfunction, which involves basal and middle, but not apical, LV segments.2 The cause of this difference is unclear, but neither ventricular contractile pattern is consistent with the myocardial territory of a single coronary artery, helping distinguish NSC and Takotsubo syndrome from AMI.The clinical manifestation and ECG changes of NSC can resemble those of AMI, including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Current guidelines advocate using coronary angiography to direct the diagnosis and therapy.3 However, if SAH-induced NSC is misdiagnosed as AMI, anticoagulation and antiplatelet treatment can exacerbate bleeding. Even more catastrophic would be the use of fibrinolytic therapy in those hospitals that lack a catheterization laboratory. Characteristic noninvasive cardiac imaging findings can help appropriately triage patients with NSC and avoid harmful procedures/treatments and adverse events. Surveillance echocardiography can help assess the recovery of LV function during follow-up. The timely diagnosis of NSC also has important implications in management. In patients with hemodynamic instability, catecholamine inotropic and pressor agents should be avoided. α-adrenergic agonists are useful in maintaining peripheral vascular pressure and supporting cerebral perfusion. While the actual effect of intra-aortic balloon pumps is uncertain in patients with LV outflow tract obstruction, hemodynamic support from baroreflex activation therapy3 and percutaneously inserted ventricular assist devices4 are targets of current and future research. Because of limited donor organ availability, only about 10% of patients in the United States who may benefit from a heart transplant undergo this procedure annually. Meanwhile, many of the patients who experience brain death from neurological insults are deemed unsuitable donors for cardiac transplantation because of NSC. The LV dysfunction during stress-induced cardiomyopathy is usually reversible. In the largest analysis of donor hearts with transient LV dysfunction, such hearts have been successfully transplanted without increasing recipient mortality rates.5 Further investigation is warranted to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and reversibility of NSC, which may increase the number of donor hearts that would otherwise be rejected primarily because of poor LV function.Because of the anoxic brain injury and irreversible neurological dysfunction, the goals of care were transitioned to comfort measures. As a candidate for organ donation, she underwent serial echocardiography that documented a complete resolution of LV systolic dysfunction within 48 hours. Cardiac catheterization results confirmed a healthy coronary anatomy. However, she did not become a heart donor eventually because of controversies on accepting donor hearts with transient LV dysfunction.",JAMA Cardiology Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,male,651,augmented_binary,"<answer>

Additionally, the other manifestations described in this case would not be explained by psoriasis. In the of setting of yellow thickened nails, sinopulmonary manifestations, and lymphedema, exertional shortness of breath is likely related to serositis, bronchiectasis, or both, and therefore the next step to evaluate these pulmonary manifestations of yellow nail syndrome would be to obtain a thoracic CT scan (option C). Severe iron deficiency (option D) can be associated with koilonychia (spooning of nails, in which nails lose their convexity and become flat or even concave in shape) but not with yellow dystrophic nails. It would also be unlikely in the absence of anemia. Although ANA testing was positive and C3 complement level was low, in the absence of antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens and double-stranded DNA, these laboratory findings are nonspecific and not diagnostic for systemic lupus erythematosus.Yellow nail syndrome is characterized by a triad of yellow thickened nails, chronic sinopleuropulmonary manifestations (rhinosinusitis, cough, bronchiectasis, and serositis), and lymphedema of the lower extremities. It is a rare acquired disorder, with fewer than 400 cases reported so far and an estimated prevalence of less than 1/1 000 000.1 It usually occurs in adults older than 50 years. There is no sex predilection.The exact etiology of yellow nail syndrome is unknown. It is hypothesized that structural or functional abnormalities of lymphatics result in oxidation of accumulated lipids, which leads to yellow discoloration of nails.1,2 Nail growth slows down longitudinally, but nail thickness is doubled.1 The nails have absent lunula and cuticle. Onycholysis is common.Most pleural effusions in patients with yellow nail syndrome have been described as exudative and serous.3 Less frequently, the pleural fluid can be milky or even chylous.3 There may be a temporal correlation with various malignancies (notably lung, breast, gallbladder, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), which raises the possibility of yellow nail syndrome being a paraneoplastic syndrome, although this view is controversial.1Management of yellow nail syndrome is symptomatic. However, in about 50% of patients, spontaneous resolution occurs without specific therapy. Oral vitamin E supplementation,1,4 along with triazole antifungals,1,5 has shown some success in normalizing nail discoloration. Repeat thoracentesis, pleurodesis, and even decortication/pleurectomy may be necessary for recurrent pleural effusions.1,3 Prophylactic antibiotics may be prescribed for bronchiectasis.5 Low-stretch bandages and elastic compression stockings are helpful for symptomatic management of lymphedema, along with local skin care, exercises, and even manual lymph drainage.1Thoracic CT scan revealed bronchiectasis, bilateral pleural effusions, and a large circumferential pericardial effusion (Figure 2).

A high index of suspicion is warranted from both medical and public health perspectives, because the basic reproduction number (the number of secondary cases generated by 1 patient) of measles ranges from 14 to 18.2 This number is significantly higher than that for other airborne infectious diseases (approximately 5 to 7). The contagious period extends from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of the rash.2 Both standard and airborne precautions should be implemented,4 including isolating patients to negative-pressure rooms.Glucocorticoids should be avoided in this setting because they may increase the risk of developing sepsis. Hepatitis associated with acute HIV infection is rare, and isolation should be prioritized when measles is suspected. Histopathologic evaluation is invasive and therefore not the best next step for making a diagnosis of measles.Measles remains a highly contagious viral infection worldwide. In 2017, there were 149 142 cases reported worldwide.5 Measles can be a diagnostic challenge during the prodromal phase because the maculopapular rash may not be visible until 4 to 7 days after disease onset.2 Additionally, patients with preexisting immunity may develop modified measles with a prolonged incubation period and mild symptoms.6 This patient did not recall any vaccination history, nor could we obtain his vaccination records; however, the severity of his presentation suggested no prior vaccination.Complications occur in approximately 30% of adults and children with measles.6 In a retrospective analysis, an elevated ALT level was observed in 67.5% of 147 consecutive adult patients. Liver involvement was more common in men than women, and 23% presented with an ALT level more than 5 times the upper normal limit (185 U/L [3.09 μkat/L]).3 Levels of ALT and aspartate aminotransferase were reported to be higher in young adults than in children.7Serology test results, such as a positive antimeasles virus IgM result or a 4-fold increase in level of antimeasles virus IgG, are commonly used in making the diagnosis.6 Alternatively, the detection of the measles virus RNA by polymerase chain reaction is useful because it allows genotype identification and helps distinguish wild-type measles from vaccine-associated measles during outbreaks.1No specific antiviral therapy is currently available for measles. Case reports have suggested the effectiveness of ribavirin in severe cases.8 In acute pediatric cases, the World Health Organization recommends the administration of vitamin A because its deficiency is associated with delayed recovery and an increased complication rate.9 Specific antiviral agents are currently at various stages of development, including intranasally delivered fusion-inhibitory peptides.10For prevention, 2 doses of vaccine after 1 year of age are recommended. One dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine ensures that 95% of children develop immunity; this number increases to 99% with 2 doses.6 Vaccine-associated complications are rare.2Additional history revealed that this patient had visited an area with a measles outbreak on a neighboring island. The detection of measles virus RNA by polymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis. Serology test results for other viral infectious diseases, including Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and hepatitis A, B, and E virus, were negative. Conservative treatment was provided and symptoms resolved after 9 days.

Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid,C,Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid,"Direct immunofluorescence (IF) showed linear deposition of IgG and C3, but no IgA, at the basement membrane zone (BMZ). Indirect IF using 1 mol/L sodium chloride–split skin showed that the patient’s IgG antibodies labeled the dermal side of the split (Figure 2A). Serum anti–type VII collagen IgG antibodies detected by human type VII collagen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were within normal range. Immunoblotting of purified human laminin 211/221 (CC085, Chemicon/Merck Millipore) identified anti–laminin γ1 IgG antibodies (Figure 2B). Prednisolone was tapered without relapse of skin lesions. One year after her initial treatment, the patient’s condition was controlled with oral prednisolone, 7.5 mg/d.A, Indirect immunofluorescence using 1M sodium chloride–split skin showed reactivity of the patient’s IgG antibodies to the dermal side of the basement membrane zone. B, Immunoblot analysis of purified human laminin 211/221. IgG antibodies against laminin γ1 were detected in the patient’s serum but not in healthy control serum. mAb indicates mouse anti–human laminin γ1 monoclonal antibody (sc-13144, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is a rare subepidermal autoimmune blistering disease, characterized by circulating autoantibodies against a 200-kDa laminin γ1 protein at the dermal-epidermal junction. It was first described as anti-p200 pemphigoid in 19961,2; in 2009, Dainichi et al3 identified laminin γ1 as the autoantigen in 90% of cases and proposed a new name, anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid.The clinical presentation of anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid can be like that of bullous pemphigoid and the inflammatory variant of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Most patients present with itchy urticarial plaques and tense blisters, often on the acral sites and extremities. Lesions usually heal without scar or milia formation4 unless the disease is accompanied by other autoimmune bullous diseases that involve scar formation, such as epidermolysis bullosa acquisita or anti–laminin 332 mucous membrane pemphigoid.5The diagnosis of anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is confirmed by histopathologic analysis, IF microscopy analyses, and detection of the specific autoantibodies. Histopathological examination shows subepidermal split formation and typically accumulation of neutrophils and/or eosinophils in the papillary dermis. Direct IF shows linear deposits of IgG and C3 along the BMZ. If serum autoantibodies bind to the dermal side of the artificial split by indirect IF microscopy on 1M sodium chloride–split skin, the differential diagnoses would include epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, anti–laminin 332 pemphigoid, and anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid. In the present case, no circulating anti–type VII collagen IgG antibodies were detected. Anti–laminin 332 pemphigoid can usually be clinically differentiated from anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid by the lack of mucosal lesions, although 20% of patients with anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid develop them. The diagnosis of anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is definitive with detection of anti–laminin γ1 IgG antibodies by immunoblotting studies, or human laminin γ1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The standard therapy for anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid has not been defined. Most cases are successfully treated with mild or moderate immunosuppressive therapies such as oral corticosteroids, minocycline, dapsone, and cyclosporine.4In summary, subepidermal bullous disease with circulating autoantibodies against the dermal side of the basement membrane zone and healing without scar formation are the key criteria supporting the diagnosis of anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid. Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid should be considered in patients with subepidermal blister formation without anti-BP180 or type VII collagen antibodies and can be diagnosed by the detection of anti–laminin γ1 autoantibodies.",JAMA Dermatology Clinicopathological Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,male,822,augmented_binary,"<answer>

While the most common cause of ptosis in adults is involutional ptosis related to levator dehiscence, other diagnoses should be considered in patients with abnormal clinical findings in addition to ptosis. In such patients, an appropriate workup should be completed prior to surgical repair, making choice A incorrect.Although ptosis that is more notable at night and with fatigue is classically seen with myasthenia gravis, patients with ptosis of other etiologies may report similar symptoms owing to reduced compensatory frontalis action by the end of the day. This patient did not have any neurologic signs or fatiguability on examination, and antiacetylcholine receptor serology findings were negative, making myasthenia gravis less likely and choice B incorrect. Similarly, the patient had normal levator function and extraocular motility, making myogenic ptosis less likely and choice C also incorrect. However, unilateral findings of superior sulcus fullness and increased resistance to retropulsion were concerning for an orbital process, making choice D the most appropriate next step. In this case, orbital imaging revealed a well-demarcated tumor involving the left lacrimal gland, with mass effect on the superior rectus-levator complex (Figure 2). Subsequent biopsy and workup demonstrated mantle cell lymphoma without systemic involvement.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with contrast showing a markedly enlarged left lacrimal gland with molding to adjacent ocular structures without bony erosion (main panel, arrowhead). There was also inferior displacement of the left globe with mass effect on the superior rectus-levator complex. A diagnostic biopsy was performed, which revealed mantle cell lymphoma. Three months after the patient completed radiation therapy, repeated MRI showed marked reduction in size of the previously enlarged left lacrimal gland, with near uniform enhancement comparable with that of the right lacrimal gland (left lower insert, arrowhead).Lacrimal gland tumors typically present with progressive proptosis and upper eyelid swelling over the course of 12 months or longer but can present with a shorter duration of symptoms, including ptosis.1-3 On magnetic resonance imaging, lacrimal gland lymphomas classically appear as well-defined masses that conform to the globe and adjacent orbital bones, are mildly hypointense to isointense on T1- and T2-weighted images, and enhance with contrast.3,4 Once a lacrimal gland biopsy confirms the diagnosis, systemic evaluation is performed for staging and treatment planning.4,5Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, representing 2% to 7% of ocular adnexal lymphomas, and is characterized by widespread disease on presentation, an aggressive clinical course, frequent recurrences, and poor survival.6 Current therapeutic options include radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, but systemic therapy may be advantageous even in stage I and II disease because of high risk of relapse.7 Although the prognosis for most ocular adnexal lymphomas is generally good, with a 5-year disease-specific survival of 81%,1,8 5-year disease-specific survival for ocular adnexal mantle cell lymphomas can be as low as 38%.6 Regardless of the initial treatment response, all patients require long-term surveillance for disease recurrence.7This case illustrates how lacrimal gland lymphomas can present as unilateral ptosis and underscores the importance of performing a thorough clinical examination (eg, palpation of periocular soft tissues and resistance to retropulsion) followed by an appropriate workup, which can lead to early detection and treatment of potentially life-threatening conditions.This patient received 24 Gy of radiation to the left lacrimal gland for localized disease. Three months after treatment, repeated magnetic resonance imaging showed significant reduction in left lacrimal gland size (Figure 2).

In this setting, non-Hodgkin lymphoma is frequently associated with EBV infection. For example, in posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders, 90% have been shown to be associated with EBV infection.9Epstein-Barr virus has also been implicated in lymphoma occurring in patients with RA treated with long-term methotrexate therapy. Waldman and Callen4 reviewed 13 cases of lymphoma associated with methotrexate and found that 9 patients were EBV positive. In this subgroup, 8 of 9 cases demonstrated complete resolution following methotrexate discontinuation. Following methotrexate withdrawal, spontaneous tumor regression has been reported in up to 59% of patients with methotrexate-associated lymphomas, with complete remission generally occurring within 4 weeks.10 Owing to the high rate of spontaneous regression, rheumatologists and oncologists often observe methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative lesions following cessation of immunosuppression rather than immediately starting chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy. An observation period of up to 2 months following cessation of methotrexate before initiating lymphoma treatment has been advocated.Methotrexate was discontinued at the advice of the patient’s rheumatologist. No other intervention or treatment was pursued. Following cessation of methotrexate therapy, the eyelid lesion and the preauricular lymphadenopathy rapidly resolved over 2 weeks, and no local or systemic recurrence was noted after 26 months of follow-up.Despite the clinical response to methotrexate withdrawal, the patient’s EBV status was assessed retrospectively and was negative. Long-term follow-up and vigilance for recurrence is warranted in patients like ours.Fewer than 20 cases of B-cell lymphoma involving the eyelids have been reported. To our knowledge, this is the first case of DLBCL of the eyelid that demonstrated spontaneous regression following cessation of immunosuppressive therapy. This case also highlighted the fact that in cases of recurrent chalazia—in addition to sebaceous carcinoma—lymphomatous infiltration should also be included in the differential diagnosis, especially in the setting of immunosuppression.",JAMA Ophthalmology Clinical Challenge ,"Biopsy of the eyelid lesion showing large atypical lymphocytes on hematoxylin-eosin stain (D, original magnification ×400) that was positive for CD20 (E, original magnification ×100), negative for CD5 (F, original magnification ×100), and negative for Bcl-1 (G, original magnification ×100).Determine Epstein-Barr virus status and consider observation following cessation of methotrexate therapy What Would You Do Next?",female,1429,augmented_binary,"<answer>

BNP is a peptide with diuretic and vasodilatory effects, secreted by cardiomyocytes in response to intraventricular volume increases.1,2 BNP levels may be used to estimate left ventricular end-diastolic volume when pulmonary artery catheterization and bedside echocardiography are unavailable. Among patients with systolic failure, BNP levels greater than 100 pg/mL correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) greater than 15 mm Hg with a sensitivity of 57% to 74%.1,2 BNP does not correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with normal systolic function who have conditions such as pulmonary embolism, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute renal failure.3-5BNP levels may predict postoperative morbidity. Elevated BNP predicted cardiac morbidity after major vascular operations.6 Serial postoperative BNP levels parallel net fluid balance with an increase and gradual decline, an effect amplified in patients with poor cardiovascular compliance.7 The Medicare midpoint reimbursement for a BNP assay is $63.8 Measuring BNP level is a cost-effective alternative to invasive procedures and imaging modalities for assessment of postoperative fluid volume status.This patient’s tachyarrhythmia is the most immediate concern. A bedside 12-lead electrocardiogram is necessary to exclude acute ischemia and unstable rhythms. In this setting, the cause of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation should be investigated. Supraventricular tachycardia in elderly postoperative patients commonly occurs from electrolyte disturbances, volume overload, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation.9 An echocardiogram, serial serum troponin levels, and a ventilation-perfusion scan were ordered to evaluate the possibility of myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism.This patient’s BNP level is elevated, reflecting stretch of ventricular cardiomyocytes. The elevated BNP level, positive fluid balance, pulmonary edema, and persistent supplemental oxygen requirement suggest the patient has volume overload and would benefit from loop diuretics. Although the patient experienced some hypoxia, given the high likelihood for congestive heart failure, administration of diuretics is indicated. If the patient did not improve after diuresis and remained hypoxic, evaluation for a pulmonary embolus by computed tomography angiography would be reasonable. Transfusion when the patient has volume overload is not indicated and should be reconsidered after the diuretics are given and the hemoglobin level remeasured.A single postoperative BNP level may not be a reliable indicator of volume status. Because this patient’s atrial fibrillation and renal insufficiency may contribute to elevated baseline BNP, preoperative and serial BNP levels may have provided more independently accurate information about the extent of his hypervolemia. Congestive heart failure can also be diagnosed by pulmonary artery catheter placement or by echocardiography.Other low-cost, noninvasive assessments of volume overload include daily weight measurement and portable chest radiography, which may show evidence of fluid overload. Low diastolic filling volume and respiratory variation of inferior vena cava diameter can be visualized with bedside echocardiography.10 Clinicians may also consider pulmonary artery catheterization and measurement of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which estimates left ventricular end-diastolic volume in the absence of pulmonary hypertension or valvular disease. This patient was successfully treated with diuretics. Ventilation-perfusion scan showed no segmental perfusion defect, and echocardiogram showed no ventricular dyskinesis.  On the fifth postoperative day, the patient was discharged to home in good condition. At his outpatient visit 2 weeks later, he remained free of complications.Oliguria and tachycardia suggest inadequate intravascular fluid volume.Dyspnea and polyuria suggest fluid overload. These are attenuated by age, nutritional status, general anesthesia, and major surgery.7,9Elderly patients often have several comorbid conditions and reduced glomerular filtration rates that, in combination with postoperative inflammation, may mask fluid shifts between intravascular and extravascular compartments.9Serially elevated BNP levels suggest excessive intravascular fluid volume that may be explained by intravenous fluid administration or by physiologic fluid shifts.When the BNP level is less than 100 pg/mL, hypervolemia is unlikely.",JAMA Diagnostic Test Interpretation ,How do you interpret these test results?,female,1463,augmented_binary,"<answer>

Spontaneous venous pulsations were not appreciated .",Order a complete blood cell count and coagulation testing,Oral and topical corticosteroids,Plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome,Fluorescein angiography,Ocular decompression retinopathy,D,Fluorescein angiography,"Retinal hemorrhaging from an acute decrease in IOP was described by Fechtner et al1 after trabeculectomy. It has also been described with other surgeries (glaucoma drainage implants, vitrectomy, orbital decompression, sclerectomy, phacoemulsification, and iridectomy), laser iridotomy, anterior chamber paracentesis, and medical hypotensive therapy.2-4 The mechanism of ocular decompression retinopathy (ODR) is unknown, although theories have been posited. Acute lowering of IOP may increase retinal arterial flow, overwhelming autoregulation, and increasing shearing pressure within capillaries.1-4 Also, a rapid drop in IOP could cause anterior movement of the lamina cribrosa and secondary axoplasmic stasis, nerve edema, and compression of the central retinal vein.2,3 In a study by Jung et al,2 of 688 adult eyes that underwent glaucoma surgery, 21 (3.1%) developed ODR; 1 was found to have fluorescein findings similar to central retinal vein occlusion. Finally, acute lowering of IOP may deform the sclera and change vitreous volume and vitreomacular traction, secondarily compressing, and shearing capillaries.2,5 Fadel et al5 described 13 of 248 pediatric eyes that developed ODR after glaucoma surgery (5.2%), hypothesizing that increased scleral compliance may account for this prevalence.Ocular decompression retinopathy hemorrhages occur in all retinal layers and may exhibit a white center; they can also extend to the subhyaloid and vitreous spaces, rarely necessitating vitrectomy. Optic nerve changes include hyperemia, edema, or hemorrhage. Although the fundus appearance may be dramatic, up to 80% of patients are asymptomatic; otherwise, there may be decreased vision, scotomas, or floaters.2 Because ODR typically occurs in younger, asymptomatic individuals, in cases where central vision has dropped, fluorescein angiography and other imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography, are important in diagnosis and evaluating for retinal edema or ischemia because other causes may present similarly (eg, central retinal vein occlusion).Ocular decompression retinopathy takes 2 to 72 weeks to resolve (mean, 13 weeks),2 and visual acuity returns to baseline in most patients.2,3,5In the series by Jung et al,2 it was found that higher preoperative IOP was associated with ODR, and the degree of postoperative IOP lowering was more influential in ODR development than actual postoperative IOP.2 Therefore, prophylaxis against ODR may include lowering of IOP prior to surgical intervention.Given unilateral findings in an otherwise healthy patient, systemic workup was deferred. However, the drop in central vision necessitated further evaluation. Diffuse retinal hemorrhages without evidence of spontaneous venous pulsations were concerning for central retinal vein occlusion; fluorescein angiography was therefore performed, without characteristic evidence of retinal venous tortuosity, delayed filling, vascular staining, or areas of capillary nonperfusion (Figure 2). The patient was observed, and the hemorrhages resolved within 1 month. Visual acuity returned to baseline within 2 months.Fluorescein angiography of the left eye showed blockage from preretinal and intraretinal hemorrhage yet normal vascular caliber and no evidence of delayed venous filling, as would be seen in acute central retinal vein occlusion.During the following year, IOP elevated in the fellow eye to 40 mm Hg, and an Ahmed tube was implanted. Given his history of ODR, this eye was pretreated with mannitol in the operating room, lowering IOP to 19 mm Hg.

Rosai-Dorfman disease,A,Rosai-Dorfman disease,"Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, was originally described by Rosai and Dorfman in 1969.1 It is a rare, benign, proliferative disease with an unknown cause but is thought to have an association with viral infections, immune-related disorders, and genetic mutations.2,3 It is most frequently seen in children and young adults (mean age, 20 years) with a male predominance of 1.4.4,5 The classic, nodal form most commonly manifests as painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Extranodal involvement occurs in up to 43% of cases and usually affects the skin, soft tissues, central nervous system, and head and neck regions. While symptoms largely depend on location and disease burden, many patients are asymptomatic. A recent study identified 31 known cases of pediatric RDD with head and neck involvement, of which 58% had unifocal disease with a predilection for the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.6 Progressive laryngotracheal involvement, as seen in the current patient, is otherwise extremely rare and, to our knowledge, was previously reported only once.7Given its rare incidence and variable clinical presentations, RDD can present a diagnostic challenge for physicians. Laboratory and radiological findings are often nonspecific, making biopsy necessary for definitive diagnosis of RDD. The nodal form shows large clustered histiocytes with round-to-oval nuclei, open chromatin, and variably distinct nucleoli with voluminous pale cytoplasm. These cells are admixed with an inflammatory infiltrate comprising lymphocytes, plasma cells, and granulocytes. Emperipolesis, the presence of intact lymphocytes within the cytoplasm of the histiocytes, is useful, though not required for diagnosis. Extranodal forms are similar to the nodal type but display more prominent fibrosis, fewer histiocytes, and scant emperipolesis. The RDD histiocytes characteristically stain positive for S100, CD68, and CD163, and negative for CD1a (excluding Langerhans cell histiocytosis).2,5Rosai-Dorfman disease may mimic lymphoma and various inflammatory disorders included in the differential diagnosis. Castleman disease displays similar clinical features to RDD but shows very different histologic findings dependent on whether it is the hyaline vascular or plasma cell variant.8 Inflammatory pseudotumor manifests as nodal or tissue masses composed of reactive lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, histiocytes, spindled fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts; however, histiocytes are negative for S100.9 Sarcoidosis may exhibit cervical lymphadenopathy and mucosal nodules in the nose and larynx but show granulomas and often multinucleated giant cells on microscopic examination.10Following pathologic diagnosis of RDD, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT may be useful for staging evaluation given its sensitivity and specificity for both nodal and extranodal regions. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging is typically recommended over CT scans in children to limit radiation exposure.2 Rosai-Dorfman disease has a variable prognosis, though most patients follow a self-limiting course and do not require treatment.2 A minority of patients, such as this one, exhibit persistent disease associated with mass effects. In such instances, management with corticosteroids, surgical resection, sirolimus, radiation, chemotherapy, or immunomodulatory therapy may be warranted.2 While there are no official treatment guidelines for RDD, routine follow-up is critical to monitor for recurrence.Albeit rare, RDD should be considered in the differential diagnosis for both children and adults with cervical lymphadenopathy and airway lesions. These patients require judicious airway management given the potential for obstruction. Thus, high clinical suspicion, combined with histopathologic evaluation, can aid in a timely diagnosis and ensure appropriate treatment.This patient was initially treated with systemic steroids with considerable improvement. However, owing to substantial weight gain, steroids were stopped, and he had interval recurrence of his laryngeal and tracheal lesions.

A hypopyon forms when white exudate collects in the inferior aspect of the anterior chamber (AC). When a hypopyon consists of neoplastic cells, the term pseudohypopyon is used. However, the appearance is identical to a hypopyon resulting from suppurative infection or inflammation.1 In this patient, AC aspiration was done and showed malignant cells (Figure 2), confirming AML relapse with monocytic differentiation.Cytology of anterior chamber aspirate showing malignant cells confirming intraocular relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (Giemsa stain, original magnification ×40).Leukemia accounts for 34.8% of ocular metastases affecting the retina, choroid, optic nerve, vitreous, iris, and AC.2 Acute leukemias present more frequently with ocular manifestations than in chronic leukemias,3 with ocular involvement ranging from 32% to 35.5%.4 Ocular involvement of the anterior segment specifically due to acute lymphocytic leukemia relapse ranges from 2.5% to 18%, while anterior involvement in AML relapse is very rare.1The differential diagnosis for hypopyon includes 4 broad categories: noninfectious inflammation, infectious, neoplastic, and corneal etiologies.1 Noninfectious causes include uveitis, most commonly HLA B-27–associated or Behçet disease–associated inflammation, and postsurgical or medical-induced inflammation, such as with rifabutin.5 Infectious causes can be exogenous with postsurgical or traumatic inoculation or endogenous, such as endogenous endophthalmitis from hematological spread. Hypopyon due to neoplasia can be caused by leukemia, lymphoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, or metastases. Finally, corneal etiologies include microbial keratitis or noninfectious chemical or traumatic injuries. Recognition on physical examination and proper investigation is crucial for correct diagnosis and treatment, as hypopyon usually occurs with specific conditions rather than as a universal ocular inflammatory response.1Option C, perform AC aspiration (as this can detect neoplastic cells) and inject intravitreal antibiotics, is the correct next step.6-8 Although rare, given this patient’s history of AML, suspicion for infiltrative pseudohypopyon as a mimicker of reactive intraocular inflammation should be raised. However, this patient is immunocompromised with a recent PICC, so an infectious process must be kept on the differential. Broad-spectrum intravitreal antibiotics, such as vancomycin and ceftazidime, should be injected until AC aspiration results return, as the consequences of untreated endophthalmitis are severe.8Option A is incorrect. A 2022 study has shown that ocular inflammation can occur in the weeks following subretinal administration of voretigene neparvovec gene therapy9; however, this patient underwent treatment years ago. Option B, perform vitrectomy, is incorrect as there is not evidence of posterior segment inflammation, the patient’s vision does not meet criteria by the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study, and there are less invasive methods for specimen evaluation. Endophthalmitis can occur in the setting of a blood-borne infection, but awaiting systemic laboratory tests and blood culture results, option D, would not help distinguish between AML pseudohypopyon vs endophthalmitis and would delay endophthalmitis treatment. Additionally, it has been suggested that leukemic pseudohypopyon can be associated with relapse even if leukemia is not systemically detected.10The patient was admitted and started venetoclax combined with fludarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin chemotherapy and received low-dose 1400 cGy involved-field radiotherapy to the eyes for 1 week.

The etiology of dislocation should be considered before surgery is performed (choice A). Connective tissue diseases can be associated with juvenile cataracts and zonular weakness but are associated with extraocular manifestations, making them less likely in this patient.5 Pseudoexfoliation syndrome can be considered given the iris transillumination defects in the fellow eye, but these can also occur following intraocular surgery.The scleral pigmentation and subluxed IOL in the opposing direction make a ciliary body tumor a consideration. Specifically, the focality, elevation, and vascularity of the lesion are concerning. The lesion should be investigated further with imaging before a biopsy is performed (choice D).

Indeed, ultrasound biomicroscopy identified a large ciliary mass displacing the PCIOL (Figure 2). B-scan ultrasonography revealed a large ciliochoroidal melanoma measuring 21 mm in largest basal diameter and 16 mm in thickness (Figure 2, inset). Systemic staging imaging did not reveal metastases.Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrating intraocular lens subluxation (pink arrowhead) by a ciliochoroidal melanoma (white arrowhead). Inset, B-scan ultrasound reveals the large intraocular mass.This case highlights that ciliary body masses may not be apparent until quite large. The intraocular melanoma was not seen at the time the subluxed IOL was initially identified. While most uveal melanomas are now treated with radiation therapy, enucleation is indicated for the largest tumors (largest basal diameter >20 mm, thickness >12 mm).6,7 Following primary treatment, patients with uveal melanoma undergo surveillance for both local and distant recurrence. Unfortunately, the risk for distant metastasis approaches 50% and is elevated with ciliary body location.6 There is currently no curative therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma.6,7Given the tumor size, enucleation of the right eye was performed. Pathology confirmed a mixed-type uveal melanoma. Six months after enucleation, liver metastases were identified, presumably related to presence of micrometastases at the time of initial diagnosis and treatment. Because of progressive disease despite immunotherapy, the patient transferred to hospice 1 year after treatment of the intraocular tumor.",JAMA Ophthalmology Clinical Challenge ,"B, Slitlamp photography of the right eye documenting a superonasal area of pigmentation on the sclera (arrowhead).Perform a biopsy of the ocular surface lesion What Would You Do Next?",non-binary,164,augmented_binary,"<answer>

Surgical excision may result in blindness.2,7 Therefore, fractionated external beam radiotherapy has become preferable, especially when treating bilateral OSNMs, and vision preservation is a priority.8Bilateral ONSMs have an insidious onset, in which vision loss precedes anatomical and radiological findings. The compromise in optic nerve axon function progresses to radiologically evident lesions over the course of months to years. Nickel et al5 reported progressive loss of vision in a 4-year-old child with bilateral ONSMs over a 6-year period. Misra and colleagues6 described bilateral ONSM in a 60-year-old patient who had experienced progressive vision loss since age 7 years and who had been lost to follow-up after radiotherapy.One of the largest ONSM studies was reported by Turbin and associates.8 In that study, 64 adult patients with ONSM comprised the following 4 groups: observation alone, surgery alone, surgery with radiotherapy, and radiotherapy alone. With up to 50 months’ follow-up, 59 of 64 patients (92%) had better than light perception vision: 18 of the 59 (31%) had received radiotherapy alone. For the patients with radiotherapy alone, there was no significant vision loss compared with patients in the other 3 groups.Optic nerve sheath biopsy was not performed due to concern about more severe vision loss. Observation alone for visual acuity and visual field loss was not pursued after tumor board discussion with the patient and her family. A course of radiotherapy was initiated using conformal fractionated techniques (ExacTrac; Brainlab) for maximal normal tissue sparing (fractionated external beam radiotherapy via rapid arc to 50.4 Gy) in 28 fractions administered over a 2-month period. Six months later, her visual acuity was counting fingers OD and 20/300 OS.This case emphasizes the importance of considering ONSM in the differential diagnosis of bilateral optic nerve atrophy in children and teens. It is crucial to understand that the goal of radiotherapy is to halt the progression of the disease. Two years after radiotherapy, the patient’s visual acuity was 20/630 OD and 20/400 OS. Repeated MRI of the brain and orbit showed stability and no further worsening of vision.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits did not show evidence of orbital extension. The patient underwent an incisional biopsy, which revealed extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated tissues on histopathology and immunohistochemistry. A staging computed tomography scan showed no adenopathy elsewhere, and radiation therapy of the orbit was therefore recommended. The patient completed a course of radiation for a total dose of 2400 cGy. Subconjunctival mass in the fornix prior to biopsy.Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma is the most frequent type of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma occurring in the conjunctiva. It typically presents in patients 70 years and older as a slow-growing salmon patch lesion in the fornix, with a slight predominance in women. Its pathogenesis is thought to involve chronic inflammation from antigenic stimulation, infection, or autoimmune processes.1Terrien marginal degeneration is a slowly progressive, commonly bilateral, painless degenerative ectasia of the peripheral cornea, occurring most often in men older than 40 years.2 It is most frequently seen in the superior cornea, where stromal thinning or furrowing with lipid deposition at the leading anterior edge is seen. Vision loss due to irregular against-the-rule astigmatism and, in rare cases, perforations can occur. Treatment options generally entail correction of the astigmatism with a rigid gas permeable contact lens, lamellar keratoplasty, or corneal patch graft if perforation is imminent. While the exact mechanism behind the condition is unknown, inflammation is generally not a prominent feature,3 unlike with Mooren ulcer, although some studies suggest an inflammatory variant.4,5 This case was less typical for Terrien degeneration in that it was completely unilateral and that it eventually developed pronounced inflammation and neovascularization.In cases of lipid keratopathy from corneal neovascularization without another known cause, there have been reports of regression of both vessels and lipids after injections of subconjunctival anti–vascular endothelial growth factor  agents, such as bevacizumab.6 In this patient, this was not the treatment of choice, as the patient had another, more pressing diagnosis that was likely contributing to the corneal findings.In this patient, it is possible that indolent, chronic inflammation from the cornea served as antigenic stimulation for the formation of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma in the adjacent conjunctiva. On the other hand, a paraneoplastic syndrome or secondary lipid deposition from pathologic neovascularization attributable to the extranodal marginal zone lymphoma can also be considered.7 Regardless of the etiology of this atypical corneal degeneration, results from this case highlight the importance of a thorough examination of the ocular surface and fornices.On repeated examinations 2 and 6 months thereafter, his visual acuity improved to 20/25 OD without any evidence of recurrence of the subconjunctival mass.

When questioned, the patient recalled a rat bite 3 days before symptom onset. Based on this history, pustule fluid and blood were submitted for culture. Blood cultures became positive, and Gram stain revealed filamentous gram-negative bacilli in “nests,” with occasional bulbous swellings. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry failed to identify the organism, but 16S rDNA sequencing identified Streptobacillus moniliformis, the causative agent of rat bite fever. No growth occurred from pustule fluid cultures.Because of the nonspecific presentation of rat bite fever, patients with a high index of clinical suspicion should be carefully questioned for rodent exposure.1 Even without a known exposure, rat bite fever should be considered in patients with an unexplained febrile illness and rash, arthritis, or risk factors such as occupational or recreational exposure to rodents.2 The duration of the patient’s symptoms and absence of oral symptoms made the diagnosis of hand, foot, and mouth disease due to enterovirus unlikely. Although testing for tick-transmitted diseases or joint fluid analysis may eventually be warranted, the next best step is obtaining a thorough history regarding exposure to rodents. This approach improves pretest probability and avoids premature conclusions by developing a focused differential diagnosis based on history and examination.3Rat bite fever is caused by S moniliformis in the United States or Spirillum minus in Asia. S moniliformis is a fastidious, facultatively anaerobic, filamentous gram-negative bacteria that colonizes the oral and nasopharyngeal tracts of rats, mice, squirrels, gerbils, and other rodents. Rat bite fever is not a notifiable disease in the United States, and, while incidence appears low, its precise incidence is unknown.1 However, infections are increasing, especially in children, because of the popularity of rodents as pets.4 Transmission also occurs by ingesting food contaminated by urine of colonized rats, causing a syndrome known as “Haverhill fever.”5Rat bite fever is characterized by fever, chills, headache, and vomiting 3 to 10 days after exposure. Without treatment, fever typically follows a relapsing-remitting pattern. Most patients develop a maculopapular, petechial, or purpuric rash, especially on the extensor surfaces of the extremities and extending to the hands and feet. Lesions can evolve into pustules and hemorrhagic vesicles. Most patients develop migratory polyarthralgias involving both small and large joints.1Rodent bite wounds should be thoroughly cleansed, and antibiotic prophylaxis and tetanus immunization may be warranted if not up to date. Rabies prophylaxis is almost never indicated for small rodent bites.6 Symptoms of rat bite fever can present early, but diagnosis is usually delayed or missed because of poor memory of rodent exposure. Additionally, the nonspecific presentation may mimic viral infections, sexually transmitted infections, drug reactions, and vasculitis.1,7S moniliformis is fastidious, and its growth is inhibited by an anticoagulant used in blood cultures. In this patient, growth occurred in the aerobic blood culture bottle but only on anaerobic solid media. No special incubation or plating strategies were used for the blood cultures, but supplemented culture methods have historically been recommended to identify S moniliformis.1 There should be communication with the microbiology laboratory to optimize the diagnostic approach for patients with suspected rat bite fever. Identification of cultured S moniliformis is challenging, as it may not be present in commercial identification databases. Definitive identification may require specialized biochemical analysis,1 sequencing, or both.Infectious diseases consultation can assist with risk assessment, laboratory communication to optimize testing, and choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy. Penicillin is the treatment of choice when diagnosis is confirmed; cephalosporins and tetracyclines may also be effective. Rat bite fever can be associated with serious complications including endocarditis, hepatitis, nephritis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, and sepsis. When diagnosed, rat bite fever can be successfully treated; however, mortality can reach 13% without treatment.7-10,The patient was initially treated with penicillin and doxycycline empirically. After the diagnosis of rat bite fever, treatment was changed to intravenous penicillin G monotherapy. Transthoracic echocardiography did not reveal valvular vegetations. Persistent back pain prompted magnetic resonance imaging of the spine, which revealed changes consistent with lumbar osteomyelitis.

Given the constellation of branch retinal artery occlusion, severe headache, and auditory changes, this was diagnostic for Susac syndrome. Vasculitic workup findings were negative for other causes.Susac syndrome is a rare disorder of the retinal, cochlear, and cerebral microvasculature, with 300 reported cases since its description in 1973.1 Classically defined as a triad of encephalopathy, retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss, it has a predilection for women (3:1) particularly between ages 20 and 40 years.Headache is the most common presenting symptom, occurring in approximately 78% of people.1 Central nervous system involvement manifests as psychiatric disturbances, confusion, and dementia. These symptoms may unfold over weeks to months. Forty percent of cases have evidence of retinal arteritis; however, this increases to 97% throughout the course of disease.1 The prolonged time course, varying neurologic symptoms, and often vague visual symptoms lend Susac syndrome to misdiagnosis. This patient falls into the subset of cases with ophthalmic disease as the initial symptom.This disease is thought to derive from immune-mediated endothelial injury of small arterioles less than 100 µm in diameter as histopathology demonstrates endothelial cell necrosis and anti–endothelial cell antibodies.2 Humoral autoimmunity may take part in the pathogenesis as antiendothelial cell IgG1 and IgM antibodies have been detected in some affected patients.3 However, there are no recommendations for the routine use of these serological tests.All patients with suspected Susac syndrome should receive fluorescein angiography, as it may detect subtle microangiopathy not seen on examination. Egan et al4 suggested that segments of arterial hyperfluorescence represent focal endotheliopathy, which may be invisible on examination, in contrast to other vasculitides. Yellow arterial plaques, called Gass plaques, may develop from lipid leakage from chronically damaged vessel walls. Gass plaques are found distant from arterial bifurcations in contrast to Hollenhorst plaques. Echocardiogram and carotid ultrasonography are unnecessary as these findings are not embolic in nature.Brain magnetic resonance imaging is of utmost importance and should not be delayed by such testing as audiometry. In the context of encephalopathy, corpus callosal lesions are pathognomonic for Susac syndrome, as the diagnosis can be made even without retinal artery occlusions or auditory changes.5 Often called snowballs, these microinfarctions are best seen on sagittal T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. Microinfarctions affecting the internal capsule may also give a string-of-pearls appearance on diffusion-weighted imaging.Corticosteroids, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathiopurine, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis have been used to manage this condition.6 The low incidence of this condition and lack of controlled studies limit the ability to create definitive treatment guidelines.In this patient, systemic steroids were initiated and her symptoms improved.

Osteosarcoma metastasis,C,Osteosarcoma metastasis,"Pathologic analysis revealed metastatic osteosarcoma in a 6.5-cm mass. The mass showed apparent bony tissue.Metastases to the thyroid gland are reported at autopsy in 1% to 24% of metastatic cancer patients.1,2 The most common sites were kidney, lung, breast, esophagus, and uterus.3-5 Some studies showed that the most common primary tumor for thyroid metastases was lung cancer4,6,7; however, some showed renal cell carcinoma.3,8 Review articles concluded that lung and renal cell carcinomas made up more than 80% of total thyroid gland metastases. Unlike uterine cancer, cancer of the cervix is not a common primary source for thyroid metastasis. Unlike the considerable predominance of primary thyroid cancers in women, some studies have found male,1 some have found female,3 and some studies have found no gender predominance4,5 for metastasis to the thyroid gland.The majority of patients presented with clinical complaints, such as new-onset neck swelling, dysphagia, dysphonia, and cough.8 Clinical differential diagnosis for a rapidly enlarging unilateral thyroid mass includes anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), thyroid lymphoma or sarcoma, metastasis to the thyroid gland, and abscess. Differential diagnosis for pathology should include osteosarcoma, sarcomatoid PDTC, ATC with osseous metaplasia, medullary thyroid carcinoma, spindle epithelial tumor with thymus-like differentiation, and synovial sarcoma.9 The cytological image may be ambiguous and requires histopathological confirmation, supported by immunohistochemical examinations.Sarcomas are derived from mesenchymal cells, such as bone, fat, and muscle. Sarcomas of the thyroid, both primary and metastatic, are rare. Osteosarcomas express vimentin; leiomyosarcomas express vimentin, desmin, and smooth-muscle actin. Unlike PDTC, ATC often displays p53 mutations and does not stain for thyroglobulin and often not vimentin. Osteosarcoma may be positive for p53.Metastases of primary tumors can be divided into 2 categories: synchronous and metachronous. Synchronous indicates that the tumors are detected at the same time as the thyroid metastases, whereas metachronous indicates that the thyroid metastases are detected some time after the primary tumor was detected. The mean interval between discovery of the primary tumor and the thyroid metastases was 5.8 years.8 Our patient presented with thyroid gland metastasis after 4 years of disease-free survival without other metastasis apparent on PET-CT examination.We recommend neck ultrasonography for all thyroid enlargement as a first step for imaging. However, in selected cases, CT or PET-CT may be considered initially if clinical suspicion is high for nonthyroid causes such as metastases.In patients with clinically suspected metastasis to the thyroid gland, core-needle biopsy achieved a significantly higher sensitivity than fine-needle biopsy without any false-negative results.10 In cases of known rare primary malignant abnormality, nontypical ultrasonography features of primary thyroid malignant abnormality, and need for an additional immunohistochemical analysis, core-needle biopsy may be primarily considered.10 In this case, we deferred biopsy considering highly calcified tissue on CT imaging and likelihood of osteosarcoma metastasis with previous history of osteosarcoma.The treatment is surgical excision of the lesion with or without lymph node dissection. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy is also considered in selected cases of local recurrence or concomitant metastases. Surgical treatment was associated with improved survival duration.3 The incidence of surgical complications was very low and did not vary by extent of surgical treatment. The most common surgical complications are injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and incomplete resection of the metastasis. In 1 review,5 no patients had tumor recurrence when margins were negative. In light of these data, subtotal thyroidectomy may be warranted unless there is concern for involvement of the contralateral lobe. However, another review3 found that recurrence was more likely in patients treated with subtotal thyroidectomies (13.3%) vs total thyroidectomies (4.8%).Metastasis of osteosarcoma to the thyroid gland is rare. It is important to consider thyroid metastases in the differential diagnosis in thyroid nodules, especially in patients with a medical history of malignant abnormality and rapidly enlarging thyroid mass.

Extrafacial granuloma faciale,B,Extrafacial granuloma faciale,"The biopsy results revealed a mixed dermal infiltrate with eosinophils, neutrophils, and plasma cells, and a nonleukocytoclastic vasculitic component without epidermal changes. The histologic appearance was compatible with extrafacial granuloma faciale (GF).Granuloma faciale is a chronic, benign, and infrequent inflammatory skin disease of unknown origin. It usually manifests as a solitary reddish-violet plaque on the face, and extrafacial involvement may occur; other potential locations include the ears, scalp, trunk, and limbs.1,2 Lesion size varies from several millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. The lesions are usually smooth on the surface and can often present with superficial telangiectasias and prominent follicular orifices, which sometimes show an orange peel appearance.3 Granuloma faciale can be divided into plaque or nodular types, with the latter being generally resistant to therapy.4In a retrospective analysis of 66 patients with GF, i27 (41.5%) patients presented with a nodule, 25 (38%) had multiple lesions, 6 (9%) had extrafacial involvement alone, and 1 (1.5%) had facial and extrafacial involvement.5 Some studies have included GF in the spectrum of IgG4-related diseases.1-4 Although the precise pathogenesis remains unknown, interferon-γ and increased local production of interleukin 5 may be important mediators.1Granuloma faciale is characterized by a diffuse polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate that mainly affects the upper half of the dermis.5,6 The histologic characteristics of leukocytoclastic vasculitis are more prominent in the beginning, with older lesions tending to have fewer neutrophils and more eosinophils and plasma cells, as well as fibrosis.1 The clinical appearance of GF is distinctive, but the differential diagnosis may include lymphoma, persistent arthropod bite reactions, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia, tumid lupus erythematosus, erythema elevatum diutinum, and various granulomatous disorders.Treatment for this condition is limited. First-line therapies include corticosteroids (intralesional injection or topical), topical use of tacrolimus, or complete surgical removal.Sweet syndrome is characterized by a constellation of clinical symptoms that include high fever and sensitive erythematous cutaneous lesions that are usually painful. Histopathologic results reveal a dense neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. In this case, the patient did not comply with the necessary criteria.7 In contrast, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is characterized by papules or nodules with an angiomatoid aspect and that are predominantly located on the head, especially around the ears. The histopathologic characteristics of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia include abnormal vascular proliferation formed by capillaries grouped around arterial or venous vessels, with lymphocytic infiltrates with eosinophils instead of a mixed dermal infiltrate.8Localized cutaneous leishmaniasis tends to occur in exposed areas of the skin and begins as a pink papule which gets bigger and becomes a nodule or a lesion similar to a plaque. The distinctive differences between GF and leishmaniasis are its clinical presentation and the evolution of the lesion; treatment for leishmaniasis can take months or years. In addition, the histopathologic results include a granulomatous infiltrate in the dermis and the presence of amastigotes in the acute phase of infection.9,10Herein, we present a rare case of nodular extrafacial GF. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion, with no recurrence reported.

On examination they had tenderness in the RIF with a positive Blumberg sign ; blood testing showed leukocyte count 10   450 / μL ( to convert to ×109 / L , multiply by 0.001 ) without any shift , C - reactive protein 1.29 mg / dL ( to convert to nanomoles per liter , multiply by 0.331 ) , and hemoglobin 11.4 g / dL ( to convert to grams per liter , multiply by 10 ) . The Alvarado score was 7 . A transabdominal ultrasonographic scan showed a tubular structure in the RIF consistent with a mildly inflamed appendix and stratification of the appendiceal wall ( 7 mm in the proximal and 11 mm in the appendiceal distal tract ) . A small amount of free fluid was present in the Douglas pouch . A transvaginal ultrasonographic scan confirmed normal intrauterine gestation with a vital embryo . Working diagnosis was uncomplicated appendicitis and initial conservative management was amoxicillin clavulanate because of the potential risks of miscarriage associated with performing an avoidable appendectomy and general anesthesia during early gestation . The patient initially improved and was discharged home 2 days later with an Alvarado score of 4 ; oral antibiotic therapy was continued . Three days later they returned to the emergency department with recurrent pain ; the clinical and ultrasonographic findings were unchanged , without evidence of complicated appendicitis , intra - abdominal fluid collection , or abscess . The Alvarado score was 5 . The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and given intravenous antibiotics . In the next 48 hours the symptoms and pain did not resolve , although inflammatory markers were low and the patient was not septic . The surgeon on call requested an urgent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) investigation ( Figure 1).Magnetic resonance imaging showed the gestational chamber and a normal intrauterine pregnancy as well as the presence of a tubular structure in the right iliac fossa ( RIF ) ( A ) and what appeared to be an inflamed , thickened appendix ( 9.83 mm in the proximal appendix ) ( B ) .",Acute appendicitis,"Salpingitis or sactosalpinx (eg, pyosalpinx or hydrosalpinx)",Heterotopic pregnancy,Nonspecific abdominal pain or pelvic inflammatory disease,C. Heterotopic pregnancy with normal intrauterine gestation and ruptured tubal pregnancy with hemoperitoneum and a normal appendix.,C,Heterotopic pregnancy,"An MRI confirmed a normal intrauterine pregnancy and the presence in the RIF of a tubular structure gradually enlarging from 10 mm in the proximal tract to 14 mm at the level of distal tip, consistent with a thickened, inflamed appendix, with some surrounding free fluid and few enlarged regional lymph nodes.Diagnostic laparoscopy (Video) showed a macroscopically normal appendix with a large hemoperitoneum. The right fallopian tube was bulky and congested, containing a heterotopic pregnancy, which is a rare condition of a simultaneous intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy,1 with signs of internal bleeding (Figure 2). Right salpingectomy was performed. Appendectomy was considered unnecessary and a potential source of intra-abdominal contamination.Ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the right Fallopian tube with surrounding blood clots and fresh blood responsible for the persistent right iliac fossa pain.One week later, ultrasonography confirmed the well-being of the uterine fetus with normal fetal heart rate and fetal movement. This intrauterine pregnancy was successfully delivered full-term.Pain in the RIF and suspected appendicitis in pregnant patients need a reliable diagnostic assessment and careful differential diagnosis, especially in the early weeks of gestation. Initial conservative management with antibiotics is recommended because of the potential risks of miscarriage associated with appendectomy and general anesthesia during early gestation,2,3 but timely surgical management is mandatory if the symptoms do not resolve after initial nonoperative management.4 This case highlights that diagnostic laparoscopy outperforms MRI in certain cases when MRI cannot demonstrate a definitive diagnosis, whereas laparoscopy may have 100% diagnostic accuracy, representing a life-saving tool—both diagnostic and therapeutic—for experienced clinicans.5The presence of a dilated structure in the RIF can also be attributed to a sactosalpinx, which is a dilated fallopian tube owing to retention of secretions (eg, pyosalpinx [pus] or hydrosalpinx [serous or clear fluid]). Pyosalpinx is one of the features of pelvic inflammatory disease. The RIF pain in young women can also be caused by pelvic inflammatory disease or nonspecific abdominal pain, and the differential diagnosis from appendicitis can be challenging and require laparoscopy. The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy in natural conception is estimated to be 1 in 30 000 pregnancies.1 In this case, the intrauterine pregnancy remained intact and a healthy baby was delivered without complications at term. The MRI findings were reported as acute appendicitis. Performing an open appendectomy via the McBurney incision under spinal anesthesia would have not allowed visualization of the ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and timely diagnostic laparoscopy was life-saving.Nonoperative, conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis is largely debated worldwide, with many studies suggesting its safety and efficacy, whereas recent meta-analyses6,7 highlighted surgery as the definitive, 1-time only, treatment with a well-known risk profile. Management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in pregnant patients is even more debated, representing a viable option with an acceptable risk-benefit ratio in such patients.8 Nonetheless, when symptoms are not resolving and/or differential diagnosis is uncertain, diagnostic laparoscopy is the best option for avoiding delays for treating complicated or ruptured appendicitis9 or, as in our case, for diagnosing alternative life-threatening conditions.Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and use of laparoscopy during pregnancy recommend diagnostic laparoscopy when available resources preclude prompt imaging for diagnosis or imaging is inconclusive. The risks of delayed diagnosis should be weighed against the risk of possible laparoscopy with negative findings (ie, diagnostic laparoscopy without positive findings needing further therapeutic action) . The surgeon should be proficient in treating conditions diagnosed at laparoscopy.10",JAMA Surgery Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,non-binary,778,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

Although computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging did not show any gross hemorrhage, further neuroimaging with angiography to evaluate the status of the aneurysm clipping, as well as the state of the ophthalmic artery circulation, would be the most appropriate next step.As the intraocular pressure was within normal limits and the patient had negative forced ductions, there was no suggestion of an orbital compartment syndrome that would necessitate a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis at this time. Surgical exploration would not be warranted because of a lack of clear etiology. There was no indication for anticoagulation at this time.The triad of sudden painless severe visual loss, complete ophthalmoplegia, and a fundus examination consistent with a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is highly suggestive of orbital infarction syndrome.1 Orbital infarction results in retinal infarction, choroidal ischemia, and ophthalmoplegia. Ophthalmic artery occlusion alone cannot cause these symptoms because of the extensive anastomoses between the ophthalmic artery and external carotid artery.Orbital infarction syndrome has been reported in the setting of acute hypoperfusion, systemic vasculitides such as giant cell arteritis, and extensive thrombosis secondary to mucormycosis.1 All cases had a characteristic constellation of symptoms including severe vision loss—often NLP—complete ophthalmoplegia, proptosis or orbital congestion, and a fundus examination consistent with a CRAO. Orbital infarction syndrome has been reported postoperatively after intracranial aneurysm clipping and spinal surgery as well as due to orbital cellulitis after transcanalicular dacryocystorhinostomy.2-4 The mechanism for postsurgical orbital infarction syndrome is unclear. A myocutaneous flap is raised in these surgeries for the craniotomy, which may cause indirect or direct pressure on the orbits, resulting in hypoperfusion.2 Other factors speculated to play a role are increased intracranial pressure and systemic hypotension, which may cause relative hypoperfusion to the orbit.Orbital infarction syndrome was likely due to a combination of these factors. Angiography showed intact clipping of the aneurysm as well as patent flow through the ophthalmic artery and its branches (Figure 2A). This suggests the ischemic event must have been transient, though sustained long enough to cause permanent damage. Patients with orbital infarction syndrome can also develop a delayed orbital compartment syndrome. Twelve hours after surgery, our patient had increased proptosis and intraocular ocular pressure of 34 mm Hg, and a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis were performed. On follow-up at 2 weeks, the ophthalmoplegia and orbital congestion had resolved but vision remained NLP.

The lenses can usually be seen in their entirety when the pupil is dilated. The cause of microspherophakia is uncertain, but it has been theorized to result from a lack of tension on the lenticular zonules, which arrests the development of the lens in its rudimentary spherical configuration.1 Microspherophakia has been noted to occur in association with a number of conditions (eg, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Alport syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome), but it can also be seen in isolation or as an autosomal dominant or recessive familial anomaly.2Patients with microspherophakia often have defective accommodation, and the spherical shape of the lenses results in myopia. This patient definitely had lenticular myopia; her axial lengths measured only 21.64 mm OD and 21.41 mm OS, and her keratometry values were 43.34 @ 94° / 46.58 @ 4° OD and 44.32 @ 81° / 46.21 @ 171° OS. In addition to generating lenticular myopia, these abnormal lenses may also narrow the anterior chamber and lead to angle-closure glaucoma, and laser peripheral iridotomy is often recommended early in management.3 The lenses may also dislocate anteriorly, causing a pupillary block.4,5 In cases of a pupillary block in patients with microspherophakia, the status of the zonules is usually uncertain. When the zonules are known to be intact, there are several methods that may aid in shifting the lens posteriorly, including cycloplegia, hyperosmotic agents to shrink the vitreous, and supine positioning.6This patient came to the emergency department having already been dilated by an outside physician and with the lenses entirely in the anterior chambers. She had previously undergone bilateral laser peripheral iridotomy, and her intraocular pressures remained normal. Zonules were not seen at all, so repeated dilation was not a good option in her case, as it might have risked lenticular displacement to the posterior pole. In refractory cases of microspherophakia with anterior lens displacement, lensectomy with vitrectomy, sutured and anterior chamber intraocular lens placement, and glaucoma shunt have been described.6,7 This patient underwent modified small-incision cataract surgery with anterior vitrectomy and the placement of a scleral-sutured intraocular lens with Hoffman pockets in the left eye and, 2 days later, in the right eye. In summary, this case demonstrates the potential for anterior lens dislocation following routine dilation in an adult patient with isolated microspherophakia. Microspherophakia should be in the differential diagnosis for patients with small, rounded lenses and narrow angles. There are various strategies for managing complications associated with microspherophakia. In cases of known microspherophakia, assessment for possible phacodonesis should be part of the ophthalmic examination, and caution should be used with routine dilation.The patient tolerated the procedures well, and the best-corrected visual acuity 1 month later was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS.

Lichen planus actinicus,C,Lichen planus actinicus,"A skin biopsy specimen of the left hand revealed a hyperkeratotic acanthotic epidermis with a prominent granular cell layer. At the dermoepidermal junction, there was a lichenoid predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate with interface change. On the basis of the clinical distribution of the eruption and corresponding histopathologic findings, a diagnosis of lichen planus (LP) actinicus was made. The patient was instructed to wear sun block on sun-exposed areas of the body. He was also prescribed clobetasol propionate, 0.05%, ointment with improvement of pruritus and the appearance of LP actinicus.Lichen planus actinicus is a rare subtype of LP that is not commonly seen in the United States. Most reported cases have occurred in individuals with dark complexions of Middle Eastern and Indian descent living in subtropical regions.1,2 Other names commonly used for this condition include actinic LP, summertime actinic lichenoid eruption, LP atrophicus annularis, and LP subtropicalis. The incidence of LP is less than 1% of the total population, whereas LP actinicus has been estimated at 1 case per million inhabitants per year.3There are 4 morphologic variants: annular hyperpigmented, melasma-like, dyschromic, and classic lichenoid. The annular hyperpigmented type is the most common form of LP actinicus and usually presents on the dorsum of the fingers and hands. All forms of LP actinicus are exacerbated by sun exposure and most remit during the winter.4 Our patient presented with both the classic lichenoid and annular hyperpigmented types.Lichen planus actinicus differs from classic LP by presenting in areas of sun-exposed skin, with a predilection for the head, dorsum of the hands, and extensor surfaces of the upper extremities, whereas classic LP usually spares the head and more commonly affects the trunk and the flexural extremities.2 Lichen planus actinicus also exhibits seasonal onset in the spring and summer, whereas classic LP reveals no seasonal predilection. The Koebner response is not commonly found in LP actinicus.4 Treatment consists of strict sun protection in conjunction with potent topical corticosteroids.

On physical examination , there was noted intraoral swelling involving the buccal and palatal aspects of the posterior maxilla . The lesion was soft and fluctuant with no appreciable drainage . The patient ’s history was notable for an 8 - year history of right maxillary first premolar impaction .

There was no proptosis or visual field changes associated with the lesion . An incisional biopsy was performed via an intraoral approach , and results demonstrated a thickly encapsulated proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells with pseudoglandular elements ( Figure , B and C ) .

Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor,D,Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor,"Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are uncommon odontogenic neoplasms with a highly characteristic clinical presentation.1,2 Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors typically present in the second decade of life and are given the epithet two-thirds tumor because approximately two-thirds of cases occur in women, approximately two-thirds of cases present in the maxilla, and approximately two-thirds of cases are associated with an impacted canine. When associated with an impacted tooth, the radiolucency frequently encompasses the entire tooth, as in the case of the present patient. This radiographic finding is rather unique and stands as a distinguishing feature from the majority of radiolucencies associated with impacted teeth, which are pericoronal (ie, specifically around the crown and not the roots of an impacted tooth). These usually represent hyperplastic dental follicles or dentigerous cysts.Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are benign and slow growing but locally expansile. They typically range in size from 2 to 3 cm, though larger lesions have been reported. Presentation with pain is infrequent and is likely owing to large size. Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors may also occasionally occur in the gingival soft tissues, although this is less common.3 Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are treated conservatively with enucleation and curettage, and recurrence is rare; a review of the literature by Philipsen et al4 identified 3 recurrences in 750 documented cases.The name adenomatoid odontogenic tumor is derived from the characteristic histopathologic features,5 as illustrated in the present case. The histopathologic findings consist of a neoplastic proliferation of whorls and strands of odontogenic epithelium that can be variably solid or cystic. The name adenomatoid refers to the ductlike or rosettelike structures seen invariably in a majority of adenomatoid odontogenic tumors. Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are thickly encapsulated in all cases, and this likely accounts for the minimal recurrence rates following conservative excision. Areas resembling calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor may be seen within adenomatoid odontogenic tumors in approximately 25% of cases and are of no prognostic importance because these hybrid neoplasms are not associated with the more aggressive behavior characteristic of calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumors.6 Recently, KRAS mutations have been identified in 71% of adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, indicating a role for mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation in the development of these neoplasms.7While the demographic and clinical presentation of the present case is strongly suggestive of an adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, other more common odontogenic cysts and neoplasms should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The dentigerous cyst is a common sequela of tooth impaction and represents a hyperplasia of epithelial and mesenchymal tissues involved in odontogenesis. Classically, this disease process is pericoronal.8 Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (odontogenic keratocyst) and ameloblastoma are 2 of the most common and most aggressive benign odontogenic neoplasms and are characterized by PTCH1 and BRAF mutations, respectively.9,10 These present as radiolucencies that may or may not be associated with an impacted tooth, mimicking dentigerous cyst; their predilection is for the posterior mandible, but they may involve any portion of the jaws. These conditions require more aggressive surgical treatment, and diagnostic confirmation via biopsy is necessary to plan optimal surgical management. The present patient underwent successful conservative excision of the mass with no complications, and at 9-month follow-up, has demonstrated no sign of recurrence or adverse events related to surgery.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,non-binary,296,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

Branchio-oto-renal syndrome,B,Branchio-oto-renal syndrome,"The skin-colored papule on the patient’s ear was consistent with an accessory tragus and the location and history of the lesion on the right lateral neck made it likely to be a branchial cleft cyst, fistula, or remnant. Based on the likely branchial cleft cyst, renal abnormalities, and ear findings, branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome was suspected. The patient underwent ultrasonography of the neck, which revealed a cutaneous tract or fistula extending to the subcutaneous tissues of the neck and likely to the hypopharynx or esophagus. Results of abdominal ultrasonography revealed small kidneys with increased echogenicity. The kidneys measured 4.3 cm and 3.9 cm in length (normal for the patient’s age, 6.2 cm). Nephrology evaluation supported the diagnosis of BOR syndrome. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were normal and no additional renal testing was completed.Branchio-oto-renal syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous developmental disorder characterized by ear, renal, and branchial anomalies. It accounts for an estimated 2% of cases of congenital deafness, with an incidence of 1 in 40 000.1 The most common features of BOR syndrome include hearing impairment, auricular malformation, branchial fistulae or cysts, preauricular sinuses or ear pits, and renal abnormalities.2 Renal anomalies range from mild hypoplasia to aplasia and agenesis.3-5 Hearing loss in BOR syndrome is progressive and may be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed.3 Some branchial anomalies are asymptomatic, but symptomatic branchial cleft fistulae often present with recurrent infections.6Major diagnostic criteria for BOR syndrome include branchial abnormalities, hearing deficit, preauricular pits, and renal abnormalities. Minor criteria include external, middle, or internal ear abnormalities; preauricular tags; facial asymmetry; and palate abnormalities. For a diagnosis of BOR syndrome, an individual must have a minimum of either 3 major criteria or 2 major criteria and 2 minor criteria.7 The diagnosis may also be considered in an individual with any of these abnormalities and a family history of possible BOR syndrome.7 Other findings reported in BOR syndrome include lacrimal duct stenosis, retrognathia, facial nerve palsy, and pancreatic duplication cysts.3,4Most often, BOR syndrome results from mutations in the EYA1 gene (OMIM 601653), located on chromosome 8, and is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern.8 Mutations in the SIX5 gene (OMIM 600963) are also associated, although much less frequently.9 Proteins encoded by the EYA1 and SIX genes form a complex that activates DNA transcription, and mutations in these genes disrupt complex formation.9 Transcription activation by the EYA1 and SIX proteins is involved in the development of fetal tissues of the second branchial arch, from which the neck, eyes, ears, and kidneys are derived. In roughly 40% of individuals meeting the criteria for BOR syndrome, EYA1 mutations are present.7 Most of these mutations can be detected by gene sequence analysis, but approximately 20% are owing to chromosomal rearrangements of EYA1 and require more advanced testing.7There have been cases of misdiagnosis of BOR syndrome as Alport syndrome, owing to clinical similarities between the 2 conditions.4 Alport syndrome is caused by defective type 4 collagen and presents during the first decade of life with hematuria, hearing loss, and ophthalmologic abnormalities.10 Hearing loss in patients with Alport syndrome tends to present during mid-childhood to late childhood rather than in infancy.10Goldenhar syndrome and papillorenal syndrome were also included in the differential. Papillorenal syndrome is characterized by optic disc dysplasia and renal hypoplasia; this diagnosis would not explain our patient’s auricular findings. Goldenhar syndrome typically presents with auricular malformations, bony spinal deformities, hemifacial microsomia, and benign growths of the eye.Families may not seek medical attention immediately if a child is not experiencing significant functional deficits secondary to the condition, as was the case with this 8-month-old patient.

Young age and lack of common risk factors for CRVO, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, was concerning for underlying systemic disease. We inquired about the patient’s medical and family history of hypercoagulable and inflammatory states associated with CRVO in young patients (choice C).1 Treatment is reserved for sequelae of CRVO, such as macular edema or neovascularization, none of which were present in our patient. Macular edema causing vision loss typically is treated with intravitreous anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy (choice B) and also may resolve with intravitreous corticosteroids (choice A) or, when due to a branch retinal vein occlusion, grid laser treatment. Neovascularization may be treated with scatter photocoagulation (choice D)2 or intravitreous anti-VEGF therapy. The patient’s primary care physician diagnosed her as having factor V Leiden mutation, a hypercoagulable state associated with CRVO. The patient reported that her father was previously diagnosed as having factor V Leiden mutation after a branch retinal vein occlusion was diagnosed at 48 years of age.Globally, the prevalence of CRVO is 0.8% and increases from 0.027% to 0.5% from the fourth to eighth decade of life.3 Individuals younger than 50 years of age make up less than 20% of cases.4Review of medical and family history may be necessary in young adults with CRVO and diagnostic testing may be performed to assess for systemic disease.2 Although not proof of causality, associated systemic disease was found in 40% to 67% of young adults with CRVO.4,5 Inquiry might include hereditary thrombophilias, blood dyscrasias, autoimmune disease, and HIV.4 Pregnancy, use of OCPs, hormone therapy, and diuretics also might be considered.1,4,6 Dehydration has been implicated in some reports of young patients with CRVO.7,8 Assessment also might include measurement of blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, complete blood cell count, lipid profile, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.9 Diagnostic studies, often performed by the primary care physician, may include HIV and pregnancy tests, coagulation panel, and autoimmune markers,4 although the risk to benefit ratio of these workups has not been elucidated.Thrombophilias, including resistance to activated protein C, antiphospholipid antibodies, factor XII deficiency, and anticoagulant protein deficiencies, have been associated with CRVO in young patients.6 These disorders, however, are not rare in the general population without CRVO, raising the possibility that CRVO is unrelated when reported in association with these abnormalities. Factor V Leiden mutation is found in 5% of the general population and 7.9% of those with retinal vein occlusion.10Oral contraception is also associated with CRVO. More than 20% of patients with perfused CRVO and younger than 45 years used OCPs,1 although it could be that a matched control group would have a similar percentage of OCP users. Thus, the risk to benefit ratio of recommending that individuals with CRVOs not commence OCPs remains unknown. Discontinuation of OCPs after CRVO probably should be decided on a case-by-case basis.9Our patient’s primary care physician was informed of the CRVO to consider with any management of factor V Leiden mutation. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents are not routinely prescribed after diagnosis of CRVO as a first thrombotic event in those with factor V Leiden mutation because of the unknown risk to benefit ratio. Our patient discontinued OCPs, after discussion about risks and benefits, and started aspirin, although the precise risk to benefit ratio of this management is not known.

Positive Congo red stain results confirmed the presence of amyloid protein (Figure, B and C).The patient underwent an extensive evaluation for hematological malignant abnormalities in coordination with hematology/oncology specialists as well as assessment of cardiac and renal involvement. Serum protein electrophoresis results were negative for paraprotein although κ and λ were elevated. A complete blood cell count with differential, urinalysis, metabolic panel, and liver function test results were normal. Echocardiogram results were unremarkable. He will be followed up by dermatology and hematology specialists to monitor for clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic disease.Primary cutaneous nodular amyloidosis is a rare disorder characterized by the localized accumulation of light-chain amyloid protein, secreted by lesional plasma cells. This is in contrast to the more common cutaneous lichen and macular amyloidosis, in which the amyloid protein derives from keratin.The morphological presentation of nodular amyloidosis is that of localized, waxy, infiltrated nodules or plaques with typical distribution of lower extremities, face, scalp, and genitals. Lesions are typically asymptomatic but can be pruritic.1 Because the clinical and pathological appearance of nodular amyloidosis can be indistinguishable from that of systemic amyloidosis, systemic involvement must be excluded in order to make the correct diagnosis. Systemic amyloidosis can result in a restrictive cardiomyopathy, proteinuria up to nephrotic range, hepatomegaly, as well as peripheral and autonomic neuropathy.2Even when distinguished from systemic amyloid, patients with localized disease require continued monitoring owing to the possibility of progression to systemic involvement. While early studies estimated this risk at around 50%, larger and more recent case series have shown progression to occur in roughly 7% of patients.1 The disease has been more rarely associated with other concomitant indolent hematologic malignant diseases.3 In addition to malignant abnormality, nodular amyloid has been reported to occur with systemic autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren syndrome and limited scleroderma.4,5Several reports have attempted to determine the clonality of plasma cells in nodular amyloid lesions. Plasma cells appear to be clonal; except in cases associated with Sjogren syndrome where both monoclonal and polyclonal infiltrates have been described.4,6 In monoclonal cases, nodular amyloid can be thought of as etiopathogenically similar plasmacytoma, with nodular amyloidosis displaying a much sparser plasma cell infiltrate but one in which the cells have a much greater secretory capacity.Nodular amyloidosis can also be understood as a manifestation of a group of disorders characterized by isolated, tissue-specific deposition of amyloid, typically of light-chain composition, by local collections of secretory monoclonal plasma cells. These disorders, referred to as amyloidomas, have been shown to occur in the central nervous system, bone, as well as a variety of levels within the respiratory and genitourinary tracts.7,8Given the rarity of cases, no standard modality exists for treatment of nodular amyloidosis.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2796096,"A patient in their mid-50s with a history of mitral valve repair presented to the emergency department with complaints of recent - onset palpitation within the last hour . On physical examination , the patient showed a rhythmic tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats / min and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg . The 12 - lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats / min ; no obvious P waves were recognizable ( Figure 1A ) . The QRS complexes displayed 2 different morphologies occurring with a definite allorhythmic distribution : pairs of beats exhibiting complete right bundle branch block ( RBBB ) and QRS duration of 140 milliseconds followed by a third beat with normal configuration and QRS duration of 70 milliseconds . This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained . Adenosine administration quickly slowed the ventricular rate allowing recognition of an atrial tachycardia with a rate of 178 / min and a 2:1 atrioventricular ( AV ) ratio ( Figure 1B).A , Regular supraventricular tachycardia with right bundle branch block aberration disappearing every third beat . B , Lead II . Numbers within the tracing indicate the R - R intervals ( in milliseconds ) . The variability in ventricular cycle lengths results from small changes in both the P - P and P - R intervals .",Perform urgent DC shock,Place a temporary pacemaker and start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone,Start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone,Order an urgent electrophysiologic investigation,Atypical atrial flutter with RBBB aberration and conduction improvement every third beat resulting from concealed type I (Wenckebach) second-degree block in the right bundle branch with 3:2 ratio,C,Start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone,"The atrial rate during adenosine administration was identical to the ventricular rate during tachycardia, implying that the arrhythmia in Figure 1A reflects an atrial tachycardia with 1:1 AV conduction. The medical history strongly suggests a macroreentrant circuit (macroreentrant atrial tachycardia, also called atypical atrial flutter) developing around the atriotomy scar related to mitral valve surgery, possibly a left-sided atrial flutter such as mitral annular flutter. The R-R interval prolongation due to the shift from 1:1 to 2:1 AV ratio restored the normal right bundle branch conduction resulting in narrow QRS complexes. This supports an intermittent phase 3 RBBB. The most challenging issue in the tracing on presentation is the periodic disappearance of the RBBB aberration. The key to the correct diagnosis is the unexpected normalization of the QRS morphology occurring periodically, every third beat, despite constant cycle lengths.1-4A pattern of complete bundle branch block does not necessarily imply a total interruption of conduction in the affected bundle branch but can also result from a delay exceeding the time required for activation from the contralateral bundle branch (accepted critical delay: 40-60 milliseconds).3 In a Wenckebach series, whenever the opening beat is normally conducted whereas complete bundle branch block occurs in the second impulse, progressive conduction delays in later beats and final failure do not further affect QRS morphology and width: the bundle branch Wenckebach phenomenon, therefore, is “incompletely concealed” being inapparent on ECG only from the second to the closing beat of each sequence.3,4 As illustrated schematically in Figure 2, while the conduction through the left bundle branch is normal, the right bundle branch shows increasingly impaired conduction owing to an area of refractoriness leading to progressive prolongation of the conduction time, until a block occurs in the third impulse of each Wenckebach series. Impulse 1 conducts down both bundle branches normally (conduction time: 40 milliseconds), resulting in narrow QRS. Impulse 2 penetrates the critical area within the right bundle branch with delayed conduction (right bundle conduction time: 90 milliseconds). Although a complete block in the right bundle branch does not occur, the delayed conduction results in ventricular depolarization via the left bundle branch, resulting in a complete RBBB pattern. Impulse 3 represents further impaired conduction and a true block in the right bundle branch. The proximal bidirectional block during the third impulse of each Wenckebach sequence doubles the effective cycle length of the right bundle branch, increasing its recovery time to 2 R-R intervals, thereby allowing normal conduction of impulse 4. This prolonged cycle length, furthermore, extends the right bundle refractory period following the normalized beat so that the second impulse of the next Wenckebach sequence once again conducts with RBBB aberration, and the mechanism then repeats.1,2 Accordingly, the Wenckebach phenomenon in the right bundle branch is incompletely concealed and is evident only on the first to second beats.3,4 Incompletely concealed Wenckebach-type block in a bundle branch was first postulated by Rosenbaum in 1969 in order to explain periodical improvements of aberrant conduction unrelated to changes in cycle length.3Schematic explanation of the behavior of intraventricular conduction. Numbers above the strip are the R-R intervals. An area of refractoriness within the right bundle results in progressively impaired conduction (red: normal conduction; gray: delayed conduction; black: conduction failure). Concealed 3:2 Wenckebach-type conduction occurs over the right bundle branch. CT indicates conduction time (in milliseconds); LB, left bundle, RB, right bundle.Alternate explanations are less convincing. Disappearance of the RBBB pattern every third beat theoretically could reflect fusion of supraventricular impulses with trigeminal right ventricular extrasystoles. However, a regular repetition of such ectopics in a fixed trigeminal rhythm with perfect synchronization with atrial impulses is unlikely; furthermore, no ventricular extrasystoles were evidenced throughout the tracing.1,2 The findings in this ECG are compatible with a 3:1 RBBB. However, such a high conduction ratio in a bundle branch is extremely rare especially in a repetitive fashion. Moreover, in order to invoke a 3:1 RBBB, a very long right bundle branch refractory period, extending over 2 cardiac cycles (>675 milliseconds), has to be assumed. Nevertheless, as the rate slows with adenosine and normal right bundle conduction resumes, some R-R intervals measuring 630 to 670 milliseconds occur (Figure 1B), which excludes this possibility.3,4Although the conduction disturbance may have been the result of mitral valve surgery, a Wenckebach-type bundle branch block occurring at fast rates does not necessarily indicate a damaged conduction system, but may represent merely a functional, phase 3 delay in the distal His-Purkinje system.1 Amiodarone infusion restored sinus rhythm, leading to persistent normalization of intraventricular conduction. Given the very recent onset of tachycardia and the low risk of stroke, postcardioversion anticoagulation was omitted.5,6 No recurrence of atrial flutter and/or RBBB was documented over a 1-year follow-up while receiving oral amiodarone.",JAMA Cardiology Clinical Challenge ,ECG indicates electrocardiogram.Place a temporary pacemaker and start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone What Would You Do Next?,non-binary,131,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

Necrotizing scleritis is a rare complication of ophthalmic surgery that typically presents as a focal area of intense scleral inflammation at the site of a previous surgery.1 It is thought to be a local autoimmune reaction and can be associated with systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, thyroid disease, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Histology of involved sclera shows a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, the nature of which is not fully understood.2,3 One theory is that surgical trauma exposes antigens from a normally immune-privileged site; following surgery, the immune system may produce antibodies to these newly exposed antigens. Exudative retinal detachment with necrotizing scleritis associated with surgery is very rare.4Necrotizing scleritis associated with surgery is more likely to occur after multiple surgeries, and while it can occur in the immediate postoperative period, it may manifest months and even decades later.5-7 In a large case series, the mean onset was 9 months after surgery in patients with a history of 2 or more ocular surgeries and 9.5 years in patients with only 1 ocular procedure.2 Management typically requires systemic immunosuppression. Patients may be started on prednisone at 1 mg/kg/d, followed by a steroid-sparing agent.8 Surgical reinforcement of scleral thinning may be required to prevent globe perforation.9For this patient, fortified antibiotics (choice A) would not be recommended, because he was already receiving topical antibiotics. Topical steroids and cycloplegia (choice B) would be insufficient treatment, given the severity of inflammation. Systemic steroids and outpatient follow-up (choice C) would be inappropriate in this patient because of his previous uncontrolled blood glucose levels while receiving oral prednisone. There is an established association between aggressive early systemic immunosuppression and a favorable visual acuity prognosis in necrotizing scleritis associated with surgery. Immunosuppression initiated within 1 month of scleritis onset seems to improve visual acuity prognosis, whereas initiation of immunosuppression after 3 months is associated with worse visual acuity outcomes.1This patient was admitted and started receiving oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/d. A rheumatology consult was requested, and an extensive autoimmune and infectious workup had negative results, including cultures and tests for quantiferon gold, syphilis IgG, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, lysosomes, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibody, and rheumatoid factor. During his hospitalization, he received intracameral bevacizumab to treat the iris neovascularization and underwent a scleral patch graft with amniotic membrane transplant over the area of scleral thinning. The rheumatology service started oral azathioprine and tapered the prednisone.By 3 weeks after presentation, the eye showed no obvious inflammation (Figure 2), and B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated resolved retinal detachment. His visual acuity improved to 20/200 OS, but his visual acuity prognosis was guarded because of the delay between symptom onset and initiation of systemic immunosuppression, which resulted in a likely long-standing exudative retinal detachment. He continues to be followed up as an outpatient.Slitlamp photograph of the left eye demonstrates residual scleromalacia.

Perform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation",D,"Perform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation","The pathological findings of the patient’s CT-guided biopsy were compatible with inflammation or SLR. The main feature of this patient was the mild presenting symptom but with the rapid development of consolidated lung with interstitial pneumonia on his CT scan. The diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was rejected because the patient had a dry cough only, and findings of bronchial washings were negative. Disease recurrence was considered, but the decreasing carcinoembryonic antigen levels  seemed inconsistent. Although a similar CT finding can be found in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)–induced interstitial lung disease (ILD), the mild symptom was incompatible with this diagnosis. There was no direct evidence to support the change of treatment to chemotherapy or steroids. With this in mind, clinicians must consider rebiopsy, and the diagnosis of the SLR was compatible with clinical symptoms and CT findings.Cancer-associated SLR is characterized by epithelioid cell granulomas with T-cell infiltration in pathologic findings (Figure, B) and observed in patients with hematological malignancies or solid tumors. In contrast to sarcoidosis with systemic involvement, cancer-associated SLR is usually asymptomatic, and the incidence of SLR lymphadenopathy in lung cancer ranges from 1.3% to 11%.1 Sarcoid-like reaction with ground-glass pulmonary infiltrates or lung consolidation is rare. Although fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is useful for evaluating the recurrence of lung cancer, it has been reported to produce false-positive results in cases of SLR.2Sarcoid-like reactions  are elicited by antigenic factors released from the tumor cells and are mostly identified in the lymph nodes draining a malignant tumor. These antigenic factors may be either shed by the tumor cells or released during tumor necrosis. Therefore, such reactions can be identified at diagnosis or after chemotherapy and immunotherapy.3 In infiltrating tumors, the production of interferon gamma by local natural killer cells and T cells activates the dendritic cells, which then present the antigen to naive CD4+ T cells, converting them into T helper 1 cells and contributing to the maturation of macrophages and granuloma formation. In an observational cohort study of 127 patients with lung cancer undergoing curative resection, 19 (14.9%) had coexistent granulomatous inflammation in the resected specimen.1 Some treatments for cancer may produce necrotic material or metabolic substances and induce granulomatosis, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for bladder cancer and interleukin-2 treatment for kidney cell carcinoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed the therapeutic landscape for lung cancer, and several reports have described the development of SLRs after the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 inhibitors.4 Assessing the expression of programmed cell death (PD) 1 and PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients receiving nivolumab therapy, a recent study showed that an elevated expression of PD-L1 sequential to blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction can be associated with SLRs.5Although SLRs have been reported in patients receiving chemotherapy and immunotherapy, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a pulmonary consolidation pattern in a patient with ROS1 rearrangement receiving an anaplastic lymphoma kinase/ROS1 inhibitor. Sarcoid-like reactions often respond to corticosteroid treatment and do not require the discontinuation of treatment. Conversely, in TKI-induced ILDs, the destroyed endothelium of alveolar vessels or pneumocytes leads to the release of cytokines and the recruitment of more inflammatory cells that, in turn, induce more damage to the endothelial cells.6 Deaths associated with TKI-induced ILD have been reported, and permanent discontinuation of TKIs is required in severe cases.In this case, while the patient’s dry cough was not severe, he decided to halt his crizotinib use. He further refused steroid use and asked to resume the ceritinib treatment. His dry cough improved substantially, and the lung consolidation lesion subsequently decreased (Figure, B). In conclusion, in cases involving a radiological pattern of disease progression, such as a new lung consolidation lesion associated with TKI use, our article suggests that a routine rebiopsy is needed to confirm the SLR and avoid misinterpretation.",JAMA Oncology Clinical Challenge ,"The CT scan after resuming ceritinib treatment for 2 months showed decreased lung consolidation and the primary tumor (yellow arrowhead).Treat with chemotherapy for disease recurrence because the agents available for recurrent ROS1 tumors remain limitedAdminister antibiotics with coverage for pneumonia pathogen for 7 to 10 days and a repeated CT scan in 4 weeksAdminister steroid treatment and discontinue crizotinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) permanently because TKI-induced interstitial lung disease is highly suspectedPerform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation What Is Your Diagnosis?",non-binary,301,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

Acute renal impairment in this setting is highly indicative of cast nephropathy, and renal biopsy should not delay treatment. Although hydration is imperative, furosemide may worsen cast nephropathy and should be avoided.2 Patients presenting with multiple myeloma and acute renal impairment attributed to cast nephropathy should urgently receive bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy to suppress light-chain production, with consideration of simultaneous mechanical removal of FLCs, to optimize renal recovery.According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG),3 this patient meets criteria for active multiple myeloma reflected by clonal bone marrow plasma cells 10% or greater and by a serum involved to uninvolved FLC ratio greater than 100, qualifying as a myeloma-defining event. Specifically, evidence of end-organ damage (CRAB criteria: hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, bone lesions) is no longer exclusively required to diagnose multiple myeloma.3 For patients previously categorized as having smoldering myeloma, the inclusion of myeloma-defining events allows for earlier recognition of patients at high risk for progression who would benefit from early intervention.Renal impairment is one of the most common complications of multiple myeloma, with risk proportional to urinary FLC concentration.4 In this patient, urinary FLCs could not be confirmed prior to initiation of therapy, although urinalysis at admission did show significant nonalbumin proteinuria. This, along with serum κ FLC concentration greater than 500 mg/L, strongly suggested cast nephropathy, circumventing the need for renal biopsy.5 Acute renal impairment in this setting is a medical emergency, warranting rapid initiation of antimyeloma therapy to reduce circulating FLCs and restore renal function, because dialysis dependence confers increased mortality.6On recognition of multiple myeloma–related renal impairment, aggressive hydration should be initiated, hypercalcemia corrected, and nephrotoxic agents avoided.5 The IMWG recommends prompt initiation of antimyeloma treatment with bortezomib-based regimens, as several studies have demonstrated superior renal recovery and rates of dialysis independence5,7 (grade A recommendation). The IMWG also recommends high-dose dexamethasone for at least the first month of therapy (grade B)5 for more rapid renal responses.7 Although immunomodulatory drugs such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide are options, these may require renal dosing and can be less effective in this setting.5 Thus, for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who have acute renal impairment, bortezomib-dexamethasone–based regimens are considered first-line therapy. More recently, bortezomib-dexamethasone plus another agent (triplet therapy) has demonstrated superior renal outcomes, including higher rates of dialysis discontinuation, resulting in improved survival.8Mechanical approaches, such as high-cutoff hemodialysis (HCO-HD) or plasma exchange, are occasionally used in conjunction with systemic antimyeloma therapy to rapidly remove FLCs from circulation. Of these, data supporting HCO-HD, which allows FLC removal through large pores, are more promising for reversal of renal impairment and dialysis independence.9 The evidence supporting plasmapheresis is controversial, limited by small trials with conflicting outcomes.5 Randomized clinical trials are ongoing to better define the role of adjunctive mechanical approaches for patients with myeloma-related renal impairment requiring dialysis. According to IMWG guidelines in 2016, in patients with multiple myeloma and acute renal impairment strongly suspected to have light chain cast nephropathy, HCO-HD should be attempted first (grade B). If unavailable, plasma exchange is a reasonable alternative (grade C).5This case highlights a recent shift in the diagnostic criteria for active multiple myeloma and offers an opportunity to discuss specific management options for myeloma-related renal impairment.The patient received bortezomib-dexamethasone plus 3 cycles of plasmapheresis, with lowering of serum FLC level and improvement in urine output. There was significant recovery of renal function; dialysis was reduced to twice weekly after 3 months of antimyeloma therapy and was no longer required after 6 months.",JAMA Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,non-binary,941,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

The shape of the opacity was similar to the trunk of the MPA and showed alternating expansion and contraction during the cardiac cycle. The opening and closing of the pulmonary valve were visible at the inferior part of the translucent shadow (Figure; Video). This was diagnosed as a large pulmonary artery air embolism in the MPA.Pericardial effusion leading to pericardial tamponade is a rare complication of BMV. However, acute tamponade is accompanied by hypotension. Also, on fluoroscopy, tamponade will appear as a decreased movement of cardiac borders along with separation of visceral and parietal pericardium due to accumulation of blood, which was not present in this case. Hence, pericardiocentesis was not indicated. Acute massive pulmonary thromboembolism in the MPA gives rise to acute-onset hypotension and dyspnea, but fluoroscopy is usually unremarkable. Rarely, fluoroscopy may show a prominent pulmonary artery, an enlarged right descending pulmonary artery (Palla sign), an abrupt cutoff of vessels, elevated hemidiaphragm along with focal pulmonary oligemia (Westermark sign), and peripheral, pleural-based, wedge-shaped opacity (Hampton hump) due to pulmonary infarction. Acute pulmonary embolism appears as a filling defect on contrast angiography rather than on fluoroscopy. As none of these features was present, intravenous thrombolytic and catheter-directed embolectomy were not indicated in this patient.Massive pulmonary artery air embolism was previously described among patients who were undergoing pacemaker implantation.1 The most common risk factors for air embolism during an intervention are dehydration, low central venous pressure, coughing, deep inspiration, old age, use of a large central venous sheath, and deep sedation. The symptoms of an air embolism can be asymptomatic to life-threatening depending on its size.2 If an air embolism occurs with resulting hypotension, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be started immediately. Patients should be given 100% oxygen and intravenous fluids, along with inotropic support and cardiopulmonary resuscitation as needed.2 Recently, the Durant maneuver (left lateral decubitus position) has been described for the management of air embolism in preference to the Trendelenburg position. In rare cases, the use of a catheter has been described for the suction of air from the pulmonary artery.3The BMV procedure was stopped immediately, and the patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position and started treatment with 100% oxygen and intravenous fluids. A decision was made to remove the air in the MPA using Judkins right coronary catheter, but the air embolus was absorbed within 3 to 4 minutes with the medical management alone.

Laboratory findings were notable only for a troponin T level of 2.41 ng / mL ( to convert to micrograms per liter , multiply by 1 ) . An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and a point - of - care transthoracic echocardiogram ( TTE ) were obtained ( Figure 1 ; Video ) .",Cardiac catheterization,Computed tomography of the head,Pulmonary computed tomography angiography,Transesophageal echocardiography,Neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy,B,Computed tomography of the head,"Elevated cardiac enzyme levels, ST-segment depression in the precordial leads on the ECG (Figure 1A), and regional wall motion abnormalities on TTE (Figure 1B; Video) were all concerning for an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cardiac arrest. A cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography could be considered after the return of spontaneous circulation. Nevertheless, there were also important discriminating imaging features in the TTE that could suggest another diagnosis; the wall motion abnormality only involved the midventricular wall, without involvement of the basal or apical segments of the left ventricle. The midventricular (hypokinetic) and apical/basal (hyperkinetic) segments exhibited a discrepant contractile pattern. This “spindle-shaped” ventricular contractile dysfunction was not consistent with the myocardial territory of a single coronary artery. Taking her manifestation and unique imaging findings into account, we gave priority to a computed tomography of the head, which showed a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with an intraventricular extension (Figure 2). Therefore, neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy (NSC) was diagnosed. Given her history of deep vein thrombosis, a pulmonary embolism could possibly cause pulseless electrical activity and new-onset atrial fibrillation. However, the characteristic TTE findings prompted us to seek a different diagnosis, and performing pulmonary computed tomography angiography was not the first choice. A transesophageal echocardiography might improve the visualization of intracardiac anatomic structures, but it is unlikely that it would offer further diagnostic help.Computed tomography image of the head showing a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (asterisks) with intraventricular extension.Intracranial hemorrhage, particularly SAH, is the leading cause of NSC. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can occur acutely and improve spontaneously over days to weeks. Neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy is thought to be caused by hemorrhage, ischemia, or edema of the hypothalamus, which stimulates the release of endogenous catecholamine and results in an extensive spasm of the systemic arteries, including the coronary arteries.1 In contrast to classical stress-induced cardiomyopathy, or Takotsubo syndrome, which is often associated with an LV “apical ballooning” pattern, NSC more commonly causes an “inverse” contractile dysfunction, which involves basal and middle, but not apical, LV segments.2 The cause of this difference is unclear, but neither ventricular contractile pattern is consistent with the myocardial territory of a single coronary artery, helping distinguish NSC and Takotsubo syndrome from AMI.The clinical manifestation and ECG changes of NSC can resemble those of AMI, including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Current guidelines advocate using coronary angiography to direct the diagnosis and therapy.3 However, if SAH-induced NSC is misdiagnosed as AMI, anticoagulation and antiplatelet treatment can exacerbate bleeding. Even more catastrophic would be the use of fibrinolytic therapy in those hospitals that lack a catheterization laboratory. Characteristic noninvasive cardiac imaging findings can help appropriately triage patients with NSC and avoid harmful procedures/treatments and adverse events. Surveillance echocardiography can help assess the recovery of LV function during follow-up. The timely diagnosis of NSC also has important implications in management. In patients with hemodynamic instability, catecholamine inotropic and pressor agents should be avoided. α-adrenergic agonists are useful in maintaining peripheral vascular pressure and supporting cerebral perfusion. While the actual effect of intra-aortic balloon pumps is uncertain in patients with LV outflow tract obstruction, hemodynamic support from baroreflex activation therapy3 and percutaneously inserted ventricular assist devices4 are targets of current and future research. Because of limited donor organ availability, only about 10% of patients in the United States who may benefit from a heart transplant undergo this procedure annually. Meanwhile, many of the patients who experience brain death from neurological insults are deemed unsuitable donors for cardiac transplantation because of NSC. The LV dysfunction during stress-induced cardiomyopathy is usually reversible. In the largest analysis of donor hearts with transient LV dysfunction, such hearts have been successfully transplanted without increasing recipient mortality rates.5 Further investigation is warranted to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and reversibility of NSC, which may increase the number of donor hearts that would otherwise be rejected primarily because of poor LV function.Because of the anoxic brain injury and irreversible neurological dysfunction, the goals of care were transitioned to comfort measures. As a candidate for organ donation, she underwent serial echocardiography that documented a complete resolution of LV systolic dysfunction within 48 hours. Cardiac catheterization results confirmed a healthy coronary anatomy. However, she did not become a heart donor eventually because of controversies on accepting donor hearts with transient LV dysfunction.",JAMA Cardiology Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,non-binary,651,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

Additionally, the other manifestations described in this case would not be explained by psoriasis. In the of setting of yellow thickened nails, sinopulmonary manifestations, and lymphedema, exertional shortness of breath is likely related to serositis, bronchiectasis, or both, and therefore the next step to evaluate these pulmonary manifestations of yellow nail syndrome would be to obtain a thoracic CT scan (option C). Severe iron deficiency (option D) can be associated with koilonychia (spooning of nails, in which nails lose their convexity and become flat or even concave in shape) but not with yellow dystrophic nails. It would also be unlikely in the absence of anemia. Although ANA testing was positive and C3 complement level was low, in the absence of antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens and double-stranded DNA, these laboratory findings are nonspecific and not diagnostic for systemic lupus erythematosus.Yellow nail syndrome is characterized by a triad of yellow thickened nails, chronic sinopleuropulmonary manifestations (rhinosinusitis, cough, bronchiectasis, and serositis), and lymphedema of the lower extremities. It is a rare acquired disorder, with fewer than 400 cases reported so far and an estimated prevalence of less than 1/1 000 000.1 It usually occurs in adults older than 50 years. There is no sex predilection.The exact etiology of yellow nail syndrome is unknown. It is hypothesized that structural or functional abnormalities of lymphatics result in oxidation of accumulated lipids, which leads to yellow discoloration of nails.1,2 Nail growth slows down longitudinally, but nail thickness is doubled.1 The nails have absent lunula and cuticle. Onycholysis is common.Most pleural effusions in patients with yellow nail syndrome have been described as exudative and serous.3 Less frequently, the pleural fluid can be milky or even chylous.3 There may be a temporal correlation with various malignancies (notably lung, breast, gallbladder, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), which raises the possibility of yellow nail syndrome being a paraneoplastic syndrome, although this view is controversial.1Management of yellow nail syndrome is symptomatic. However, in about 50% of patients, spontaneous resolution occurs without specific therapy. Oral vitamin E supplementation,1,4 along with triazole antifungals,1,5 has shown some success in normalizing nail discoloration.

A high index of suspicion is warranted from both medical and public health perspectives, because the basic reproduction number (the number of secondary cases generated by 1 patient) of measles ranges from 14 to 18.2 This number is significantly higher than that for other airborne infectious diseases (approximately 5 to 7). The contagious period extends from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of the rash.2 Both standard and airborne precautions should be implemented,4 including isolating patients to negative-pressure rooms.Glucocorticoids should be avoided in this setting because they may increase the risk of developing sepsis. Hepatitis associated with acute HIV infection is rare, and isolation should be prioritized when measles is suspected. Histopathologic evaluation is invasive and therefore not the best next step for making a diagnosis of measles.Measles remains a highly contagious viral infection worldwide. In 2017, there were 149 142 cases reported worldwide.5 Measles can be a diagnostic challenge during the prodromal phase because the maculopapular rash may not be visible until 4 to 7 days after disease onset.2 Additionally, patients with preexisting immunity may develop modified measles with a prolonged incubation period and mild symptoms.6 This patient did not recall any vaccination history, nor could we obtain his vaccination records; however, the severity of his presentation suggested no prior vaccination.Complications occur in approximately 30% of adults and children with measles.6 In a retrospective analysis, an elevated ALT level was observed in 67.5% of 147 consecutive adult patients. Liver involvement was more common in men than women, and 23% presented with an ALT level more than 5 times the upper normal limit (185 U/L [3.09 μkat/L]).3 Levels of ALT and aspartate aminotransferase were reported to be higher in young adults than in children.7Serology test results, such as a positive antimeasles virus IgM result or a 4-fold increase in level of antimeasles virus IgG, are commonly used in making the diagnosis.6 Alternatively, the detection of the measles virus RNA by polymerase chain reaction is useful because it allows genotype identification and helps distinguish wild-type measles from vaccine-associated measles during outbreaks.1No specific antiviral therapy is currently available for measles. Case reports have suggested the effectiveness of ribavirin in severe cases.8 In acute pediatric cases, the World Health Organization recommends the administration of vitamin A because its deficiency is associated with delayed recovery and an increased complication rate.9 Specific antiviral agents are currently at various stages of development, including intranasally delivered fusion-inhibitory peptides.10For prevention, 2 doses of vaccine after 1 year of age are recommended. One dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine ensures that 95% of children develop immunity; this number increases to 99% with 2 doses.6 Vaccine-associated complications are rare.2Additional history revealed that this patient had visited an area with a measles outbreak on a neighboring island. The detection of measles virus RNA by polymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis. Serology test results for other viral infectious diseases, including Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and hepatitis A, B, and E virus, were negative.

The erythema did not respond to topical corticosteroid , oral roxithromycin ( 300 mg / d ) , or narrow - band UV - B phototherapy . The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension and was treated with glimepiride , sitagliptin phosphate hydrate , and amlodipine besylate . The patient also had polymyalgia , which was treated with a low dose of prednisolone . The prednisolone therapy had been discontinued 2 months before their visit to the dermatology clinic when they had been hospitalized with pneumonia . Multiple tense blisters had subsequently appeared on the palms . Physical examination at the first visit revealed scaly erythematous plaques on the whole body and tense blisters on the arms , hands , soles , and buttocks . Neither scar formation or mucosal involvement was observed . A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from a bulla on the forearm . Histopathologic analysis revealed a subepidermal bulla with inflammatory infiltrates of neutrophils . The results of an IgG chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay for bullous pemphigoid ( BP ) 180 noncollagenous ( NC ) 16A were negative . After treatment with oral prednisolone , 20 mg / d , the lesions healed without scar or milia formation ( Figure 1).Clinical features before ( A ) and after ( B ) treatment with oral prednisolone , showing no scar formation .",Bullous pemphigoid,Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita,Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid,Linear IgA dermatosis,C. Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid,C,Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid,"Direct immunofluorescence (IF) showed linear deposition of IgG and C3, but no IgA, at the basement membrane zone (BMZ). Indirect IF using 1 mol/L sodium chloride–split skin showed that the patient’s IgG antibodies labeled the dermal side of the split (Figure 2A). Serum anti–type VII collagen IgG antibodies detected by human type VII collagen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were within normal range. Immunoblotting of purified human laminin 211/221 (CC085, Chemicon/Merck Millipore) identified anti–laminin γ1 IgG antibodies (Figure 2B). Prednisolone was tapered without relapse of skin lesions. One year after her initial treatment, the patient’s condition was controlled with oral prednisolone, 7.5 mg/d.A, Indirect immunofluorescence using 1M sodium chloride–split skin showed reactivity of the patient’s IgG antibodies to the dermal side of the basement membrane zone. B, Immunoblot analysis of purified human laminin 211/221. IgG antibodies against laminin γ1 were detected in the patient’s serum but not in healthy control serum. mAb indicates mouse anti–human laminin γ1 monoclonal antibody (sc-13144, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is a rare subepidermal autoimmune blistering disease, characterized by circulating autoantibodies against a 200-kDa laminin γ1 protein at the dermal-epidermal junction. It was first described as anti-p200 pemphigoid in 19961,2; in 2009, Dainichi et al3 identified laminin γ1 as the autoantigen in 90% of cases and proposed a new name, anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid.The clinical presentation of anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid can be like that of bullous pemphigoid and the inflammatory variant of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Most patients present with itchy urticarial plaques and tense blisters, often on the acral sites and extremities. Lesions usually heal without scar or milia formation4 unless the disease is accompanied by other autoimmune bullous diseases that involve scar formation, such as epidermolysis bullosa acquisita or anti–laminin 332 mucous membrane pemphigoid.5The diagnosis of anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is confirmed by histopathologic analysis, IF microscopy analyses, and detection of the specific autoantibodies. Histopathological examination shows subepidermal split formation and typically accumulation of neutrophils and/or eosinophils in the papillary dermis. Direct IF shows linear deposits of IgG and C3 along the BMZ. If serum autoantibodies bind to the dermal side of the artificial split by indirect IF microscopy on 1M sodium chloride–split skin, the differential diagnoses would include epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, anti–laminin 332 pemphigoid, and anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid. In the present case, no circulating anti–type VII collagen IgG antibodies were detected. Anti–laminin 332 pemphigoid can usually be clinically differentiated from anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid by the lack of mucosal lesions, although 20% of patients with anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid develop them. The diagnosis of anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is definitive with detection of anti–laminin γ1 IgG antibodies by immunoblotting studies, or human laminin γ1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The standard therapy for anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid has not been defined. Most cases are successfully treated with mild or moderate immunosuppressive therapies such as oral corticosteroids, minocycline, dapsone, and cyclosporine.4In summary, subepidermal bullous disease with circulating autoantibodies against the dermal side of the basement membrane zone and healing without scar formation are the key criteria supporting the diagnosis of anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid. Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid should be considered in patients with subepidermal blister formation without anti-BP180 or type VII collagen antibodies and can be diagnosed by the detection of anti–laminin γ1 autoantibodies.",JAMA Dermatology Clinicopathological Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,non-binary,822,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

While the most common cause of ptosis in adults is involutional ptosis related to levator dehiscence, other diagnoses should be considered in patients with abnormal clinical findings in addition to ptosis. In such patients, an appropriate workup should be completed prior to surgical repair, making choice A incorrect.Although ptosis that is more notable at night and with fatigue is classically seen with myasthenia gravis, patients with ptosis of other etiologies may report similar symptoms owing to reduced compensatory frontalis action by the end of the day. This patient did not have any neurologic signs or fatiguability on examination, and antiacetylcholine receptor serology findings were negative, making myasthenia gravis less likely and choice B incorrect. Similarly, the patient had normal levator function and extraocular motility, making myogenic ptosis less likely and choice C also incorrect. However, unilateral findings of superior sulcus fullness and increased resistance to retropulsion were concerning for an orbital process, making choice D the most appropriate next step. In this case, orbital imaging revealed a well-demarcated tumor involving the left lacrimal gland, with mass effect on the superior rectus-levator complex (Figure 2). Subsequent biopsy and workup demonstrated mantle cell lymphoma without systemic involvement.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with contrast showing a markedly enlarged left lacrimal gland with molding to adjacent ocular structures without bony erosion (main panel, arrowhead). There was also inferior displacement of the left globe with mass effect on the superior rectus-levator complex. A diagnostic biopsy was performed, which revealed mantle cell lymphoma. Three months after the patient completed radiation therapy, repeated MRI showed marked reduction in size of the previously enlarged left lacrimal gland, with near uniform enhancement comparable with that of the right lacrimal gland (left lower insert, arrowhead).Lacrimal gland tumors typically present with progressive proptosis and upper eyelid swelling over the course of 12 months or longer but can present with a shorter duration of symptoms, including ptosis.1-3 On magnetic resonance imaging, lacrimal gland lymphomas classically appear as well-defined masses that conform to the globe and adjacent orbital bones, are mildly hypointense to isointense on T1- and T2-weighted images, and enhance with contrast.3,4 Once a lacrimal gland biopsy confirms the diagnosis, systemic evaluation is performed for staging and treatment planning.4,5Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, representing 2% to 7% of ocular adnexal lymphomas, and is characterized by widespread disease on presentation, an aggressive clinical course, frequent recurrences, and poor survival.6 Current therapeutic options include radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, but systemic therapy may be advantageous even in stage I and II disease because of high risk of relapse.7 Although the prognosis for most ocular adnexal lymphomas is generally good, with a 5-year disease-specific survival of 81%,1,8 5-year disease-specific survival for ocular adnexal mantle cell lymphomas can be as low as 38%.6 Regardless of the initial treatment response, all patients require long-term surveillance for disease recurrence.7This case illustrates how lacrimal gland lymphomas can present as unilateral ptosis and underscores the importance of performing a thorough clinical examination (eg, palpation of periocular soft tissues and resistance to retropulsion) followed by an appropriate workup, which can lead to early detection and treatment of potentially life-threatening conditions.This patient received 24 Gy of radiation to the left lacrimal gland for localized disease. Three months after treatment, repeated magnetic resonance imaging showed significant reduction in left lacrimal gland size (Figure 2).

In this setting, non-Hodgkin lymphoma is frequently associated with EBV infection. For example, in posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders, 90% have been shown to be associated with EBV infection.9Epstein-Barr virus has also been implicated in lymphoma occurring in patients with RA treated with long-term methotrexate therapy. Waldman and Callen4 reviewed 13 cases of lymphoma associated with methotrexate and found that 9 patients were EBV positive. In this subgroup, 8 of 9 cases demonstrated complete resolution following methotrexate discontinuation. Following methotrexate withdrawal, spontaneous tumor regression has been reported in up to 59% of patients with methotrexate-associated lymphomas, with complete remission generally occurring within 4 weeks.10 Owing to the high rate of spontaneous regression, rheumatologists and oncologists often observe methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative lesions following cessation of immunosuppression rather than immediately starting chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy. An observation period of up to 2 months following cessation of methotrexate before initiating lymphoma treatment has been advocated.Methotrexate was discontinued at the advice of the patient’s rheumatologist. No other intervention or treatment was pursued. Following cessation of methotrexate therapy, the eyelid lesion and the preauricular lymphadenopathy rapidly resolved over 2 weeks, and no local or systemic recurrence was noted after 26 months of follow-up.Despite the clinical response to methotrexate withdrawal, the patient’s EBV status was assessed retrospectively and was negative. Long-term follow-up and vigilance for recurrence is warranted in patients like ours.Fewer than 20 cases of B-cell lymphoma involving the eyelids have been reported. To our knowledge, this is the first case of DLBCL of the eyelid that demonstrated spontaneous regression following cessation of immunosuppressive therapy. This case also highlighted the fact that in cases of recurrent chalazia—in addition to sebaceous carcinoma—lymphomatous infiltration should also be included in the differential diagnosis, especially in the setting of immunosuppression.",JAMA Ophthalmology Clinical Challenge ,"Biopsy of the eyelid lesion showing large atypical lymphocytes on hematoxylin-eosin stain (D, original magnification ×400) that was positive for CD20 (E, original magnification ×100), negative for CD5 (F, original magnification ×100), and negative for Bcl-1 (G, original magnification ×100).Determine Epstein-Barr virus status and consider observation following cessation of methotrexate therapy What Would You Do Next?",non-binary,1429,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

BNP is a peptide with diuretic and vasodilatory effects, secreted by cardiomyocytes in response to intraventricular volume increases.1,2 BNP levels may be used to estimate left ventricular end-diastolic volume when pulmonary artery catheterization and bedside echocardiography are unavailable. Among patients with systolic failure, BNP levels greater than 100 pg/mL correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) greater than 15 mm Hg with a sensitivity of 57% to 74%.1,2 BNP does not correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with normal systolic function who have conditions such as pulmonary embolism, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute renal failure.3-5BNP levels may predict postoperative morbidity. Elevated BNP predicted cardiac morbidity after major vascular operations.6 Serial postoperative BNP levels parallel net fluid balance with an increase and gradual decline, an effect amplified in patients with poor cardiovascular compliance.7 The Medicare midpoint reimbursement for a BNP assay is $63.8 Measuring BNP level is a cost-effective alternative to invasive procedures and imaging modalities for assessment of postoperative fluid volume status.This patient’s tachyarrhythmia is the most immediate concern. A bedside 12-lead electrocardiogram is necessary to exclude acute ischemia and unstable rhythms. In this setting, the cause of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation should be investigated. Supraventricular tachycardia in elderly postoperative patients commonly occurs from electrolyte disturbances, volume overload, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation.9 An echocardiogram, serial serum troponin levels, and a ventilation-perfusion scan were ordered to evaluate the possibility of myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism.This patient’s BNP level is elevated, reflecting stretch of ventricular cardiomyocytes. The elevated BNP level, positive fluid balance, pulmonary edema, and persistent supplemental oxygen requirement suggest the patient has volume overload and would benefit from loop diuretics. Although the patient experienced some hypoxia, given the high likelihood for congestive heart failure, administration of diuretics is indicated. If the patient did not improve after diuresis and remained hypoxic, evaluation for a pulmonary embolus by computed tomography angiography would be reasonable. Transfusion when the patient has volume overload is not indicated and should be reconsidered after the diuretics are given and the hemoglobin level remeasured.A single postoperative BNP level may not be a reliable indicator of volume status. Because this patient’s atrial fibrillation and renal insufficiency may contribute to elevated baseline BNP, preoperative and serial BNP levels may have provided more independently accurate information about the extent of his hypervolemia. Congestive heart failure can also be diagnosed by pulmonary artery catheter placement or by echocardiography.Other low-cost, noninvasive assessments of volume overload include daily weight measurement and portable chest radiography, which may show evidence of fluid overload. Low diastolic filling volume and respiratory variation of inferior vena cava diameter can be visualized with bedside echocardiography.10 Clinicians may also consider pulmonary artery catheterization and measurement of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which estimates left ventricular end-diastolic volume in the absence of pulmonary hypertension or valvular disease. This patient was successfully treated with diuretics. Ventilation-perfusion scan showed no segmental perfusion defect, and echocardiogram showed no ventricular dyskinesis.  On the fifth postoperative day, the patient was discharged to home in good condition. At his outpatient visit 2 weeks later, he remained free of complications.Oliguria and tachycardia suggest inadequate intravascular fluid volume.Dyspnea and polyuria suggest fluid overload. These are attenuated by age, nutritional status, general anesthesia, and major surgery.7,9Elderly patients often have several comorbid conditions and reduced glomerular filtration rates that, in combination with postoperative inflammation, may mask fluid shifts between intravascular and extravascular compartments.9Serially elevated BNP levels suggest excessive intravascular fluid volume that may be explained by intravenous fluid administration or by physiologic fluid shifts.When the BNP level is less than 100 pg/mL, hypervolemia is unlikely.",JAMA Diagnostic Test Interpretation ,How do you interpret these test results?,non-binary,1463,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

Spontaneous venous pulsations were not appreciated .",Order a complete blood cell count and coagulation testing,Oral and topical corticosteroids,Plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome,Fluorescein angiography,Ocular decompression retinopathy,D,Fluorescein angiography,"Retinal hemorrhaging from an acute decrease in IOP was described by Fechtner et al1 after trabeculectomy. It has also been described with other surgeries (glaucoma drainage implants, vitrectomy, orbital decompression, sclerectomy, phacoemulsification, and iridectomy), laser iridotomy, anterior chamber paracentesis, and medical hypotensive therapy.2-4 The mechanism of ocular decompression retinopathy (ODR) is unknown, although theories have been posited. Acute lowering of IOP may increase retinal arterial flow, overwhelming autoregulation, and increasing shearing pressure within capillaries.1-4 Also, a rapid drop in IOP could cause anterior movement of the lamina cribrosa and secondary axoplasmic stasis, nerve edema, and compression of the central retinal vein.2,3 In a study by Jung et al,2 of 688 adult eyes that underwent glaucoma surgery, 21 (3.1%) developed ODR; 1 was found to have fluorescein findings similar to central retinal vein occlusion. Finally, acute lowering of IOP may deform the sclera and change vitreous volume and vitreomacular traction, secondarily compressing, and shearing capillaries.2,5 Fadel et al5 described 13 of 248 pediatric eyes that developed ODR after glaucoma surgery (5.2%), hypothesizing that increased scleral compliance may account for this prevalence.Ocular decompression retinopathy hemorrhages occur in all retinal layers and may exhibit a white center; they can also extend to the subhyaloid and vitreous spaces, rarely necessitating vitrectomy. Optic nerve changes include hyperemia, edema, or hemorrhage. Although the fundus appearance may be dramatic, up to 80% of patients are asymptomatic; otherwise, there may be decreased vision, scotomas, or floaters.2 Because ODR typically occurs in younger, asymptomatic individuals, in cases where central vision has dropped, fluorescein angiography and other imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography, are important in diagnosis and evaluating for retinal edema or ischemia because other causes may present similarly (eg, central retinal vein occlusion).Ocular decompression retinopathy takes 2 to 72 weeks to resolve (mean, 13 weeks),2 and visual acuity returns to baseline in most patients.2,3,5In the series by Jung et al,2 it was found that higher preoperative IOP was associated with ODR, and the degree of postoperative IOP lowering was more influential in ODR development than actual postoperative IOP.2 Therefore, prophylaxis against ODR may include lowering of IOP prior to surgical intervention.Given unilateral findings in an otherwise healthy patient, systemic workup was deferred. However, the drop in central vision necessitated further evaluation. Diffuse retinal hemorrhages without evidence of spontaneous venous pulsations were concerning for central retinal vein occlusion; fluorescein angiography was therefore performed, without characteristic evidence of retinal venous tortuosity, delayed filling, vascular staining, or areas of capillary nonperfusion (Figure 2). The patient was observed, and the hemorrhages resolved within 1 month. Visual acuity returned to baseline within 2 months.Fluorescein angiography of the left eye showed blockage from preretinal and intraretinal hemorrhage yet normal vascular caliber and no evidence of delayed venous filling, as would be seen in acute central retinal vein occlusion.During the following year, IOP elevated in the fellow eye to 40 mm Hg, and an Ahmed tube was implanted. Given his history of ODR, this eye was pretreated with mannitol in the operating room, lowering IOP to 19 mm Hg. A paracentesis was created, with injection of anterior chamber viscoelastic prior to tube insertion. This postoperative course was uncomplicated.",JAMA Ophthalmology Clinical Challenge ,"Slitlamp examination of the right eye revealed a normal anterior and posterior segment, with no retinal vascular abnormality or hemorrhage.The fundus of the left eye showed peripapillary hemorrhages, nasal disc edema, and diffuse retinal and preretinal hemorrhages throughout the posterior pole and periphery; a white-centered hemorrhage is found within the superior macula.Order a complete blood cell count and coagulation testing What Would You Do Next?",non-binary,975,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

Rosai-Dorfman disease,A,Rosai-Dorfman disease,"Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, was originally described by Rosai and Dorfman in 1969.1 It is a rare, benign, proliferative disease with an unknown cause but is thought to have an association with viral infections, immune-related disorders, and genetic mutations.2,3 It is most frequently seen in children and young adults (mean age, 20 years) with a male predominance of 1.4.4,5 The classic, nodal form most commonly manifests as painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Extranodal involvement occurs in up to 43% of cases and usually affects the skin, soft tissues, central nervous system, and head and neck regions. While symptoms largely depend on location and disease burden, many patients are asymptomatic. A recent study identified 31 known cases of pediatric RDD with head and neck involvement, of which 58% had unifocal disease with a predilection for the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.6 Progressive laryngotracheal involvement, as seen in the current patient, is otherwise extremely rare and, to our knowledge, was previously reported only once.7Given its rare incidence and variable clinical presentations, RDD can present a diagnostic challenge for physicians. Laboratory and radiological findings are often nonspecific, making biopsy necessary for definitive diagnosis of RDD. The nodal form shows large clustered histiocytes with round-to-oval nuclei, open chromatin, and variably distinct nucleoli with voluminous pale cytoplasm. These cells are admixed with an inflammatory infiltrate comprising lymphocytes, plasma cells, and granulocytes. Emperipolesis, the presence of intact lymphocytes within the cytoplasm of the histiocytes, is useful, though not required for diagnosis. Extranodal forms are similar to the nodal type but display more prominent fibrosis, fewer histiocytes, and scant emperipolesis. The RDD histiocytes characteristically stain positive for S100, CD68, and CD163, and negative for CD1a (excluding Langerhans cell histiocytosis).2,5Rosai-Dorfman disease may mimic lymphoma and various inflammatory disorders included in the differential diagnosis. Castleman disease displays similar clinical features to RDD but shows very different histologic findings dependent on whether it is the hyaline vascular or plasma cell variant.8 Inflammatory pseudotumor manifests as nodal or tissue masses composed of reactive lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, histiocytes, spindled fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts; however, histiocytes are negative for S100.9 Sarcoidosis may exhibit cervical lymphadenopathy and mucosal nodules in the nose and larynx but show granulomas and often multinucleated giant cells on microscopic examination.10Following pathologic diagnosis of RDD, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT may be useful for staging evaluation given its sensitivity and specificity for both nodal and extranodal regions. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging is typically recommended over CT scans in children to limit radiation exposure.2 Rosai-Dorfman disease has a variable prognosis, though most patients follow a self-limiting course and do not require treatment.2 A minority of patients, such as this one, exhibit persistent disease associated with mass effects. In such instances, management with corticosteroids, surgical resection, sirolimus, radiation, chemotherapy, or immunomodulatory therapy may be warranted.2 While there are no official treatment guidelines for RDD, routine follow-up is critical to monitor for recurrence.Albeit rare, RDD should be considered in the differential diagnosis for both children and adults with cervical lymphadenopathy and airway lesions. These patients require judicious airway management given the potential for obstruction. Thus, high clinical suspicion, combined with histopathologic evaluation, can aid in a timely diagnosis and ensure appropriate treatment.This patient was initially treated with systemic steroids with considerable improvement. However, owing to substantial weight gain, steroids were stopped, and he had interval recurrence of his laryngeal and tracheal lesions.

A hypopyon forms when white exudate collects in the inferior aspect of the anterior chamber (AC). When a hypopyon consists of neoplastic cells, the term pseudohypopyon is used. However, the appearance is identical to a hypopyon resulting from suppurative infection or inflammation.1 In this patient, AC aspiration was done and showed malignant cells (Figure 2), confirming AML relapse with monocytic differentiation.Cytology of anterior chamber aspirate showing malignant cells confirming intraocular relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (Giemsa stain, original magnification ×40).Leukemia accounts for 34.8% of ocular metastases affecting the retina, choroid, optic nerve, vitreous, iris, and AC.2 Acute leukemias present more frequently with ocular manifestations than in chronic leukemias,3 with ocular involvement ranging from 32% to 35.5%.4 Ocular involvement of the anterior segment specifically due to acute lymphocytic leukemia relapse ranges from 2.5% to 18%, while anterior involvement in AML relapse is very rare.1The differential diagnosis for hypopyon includes 4 broad categories: noninfectious inflammation, infectious, neoplastic, and corneal etiologies.1 Noninfectious causes include uveitis, most commonly HLA B-27–associated or Behçet disease–associated inflammation, and postsurgical or medical-induced inflammation, such as with rifabutin.5 Infectious causes can be exogenous with postsurgical or traumatic inoculation or endogenous, such as endogenous endophthalmitis from hematological spread. Hypopyon due to neoplasia can be caused by leukemia, lymphoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, or metastases. Finally, corneal etiologies include microbial keratitis or noninfectious chemical or traumatic injuries. Recognition on physical examination and proper investigation is crucial for correct diagnosis and treatment, as hypopyon usually occurs with specific conditions rather than as a universal ocular inflammatory response.1Option C, perform AC aspiration (as this can detect neoplastic cells) and inject intravitreal antibiotics, is the correct next step.6-8 Although rare, given this patient’s history of AML, suspicion for infiltrative pseudohypopyon as a mimicker of reactive intraocular inflammation should be raised. However, this patient is immunocompromised with a recent PICC, so an infectious process must be kept on the differential. Broad-spectrum intravitreal antibiotics, such as vancomycin and ceftazidime, should be injected until AC aspiration results return, as the consequences of untreated endophthalmitis are severe.8Option A is incorrect. A 2022 study has shown that ocular inflammation can occur in the weeks following subretinal administration of voretigene neparvovec gene therapy9; however, this patient underwent treatment years ago. Option B, perform vitrectomy, is incorrect as there is not evidence of posterior segment inflammation, the patient’s vision does not meet criteria by the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study, and there are less invasive methods for specimen evaluation. Endophthalmitis can occur in the setting of a blood-borne infection, but awaiting systemic laboratory tests and blood culture results, option D, would not help distinguish between AML pseudohypopyon vs endophthalmitis and would delay endophthalmitis treatment. Additionally, it has been suggested that leukemic pseudohypopyon can be associated with relapse even if leukemia is not systemically detected.10The patient was admitted and started venetoclax combined with fludarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin chemotherapy and received low-dose 1400 cGy involved-field radiotherapy to the eyes for 1 week.

The etiology of dislocation should be considered before surgery is performed (choice A). Connective tissue diseases can be associated with juvenile cataracts and zonular weakness but are associated with extraocular manifestations, making them less likely in this patient.5 Pseudoexfoliation syndrome can be considered given the iris transillumination defects in the fellow eye, but these can also occur following intraocular surgery.The scleral pigmentation and subluxed IOL in the opposing direction make a ciliary body tumor a consideration.

Surgical excision may result in blindness.2,7 Therefore, fractionated external beam radiotherapy has become preferable, especially when treating bilateral OSNMs, and vision preservation is a priority.8Bilateral ONSMs have an insidious onset, in which vision loss precedes anatomical and radiological findings. The compromise in optic nerve axon function progresses to radiologically evident lesions over the course of months to years. Nickel et al5 reported progressive loss of vision in a 4-year-old child with bilateral ONSMs over a 6-year period. Misra and colleagues6 described bilateral ONSM in a 60-year-old patient who had experienced progressive vision loss since age 7 years and who had been lost to follow-up after radiotherapy.One of the largest ONSM studies was reported by Turbin and associates.8 In that study, 64 adult patients with ONSM comprised the following 4 groups: observation alone, surgery alone, surgery with radiotherapy, and radiotherapy alone. With up to 50 months’ follow-up, 59 of 64 patients (92%) had better than light perception vision: 18 of the 59 (31%) had received radiotherapy alone. For the patients with radiotherapy alone, there was no significant vision loss compared with patients in the other 3 groups.Optic nerve sheath biopsy was not performed due to concern about more severe vision loss. Observation alone for visual acuity and visual field loss was not pursued after tumor board discussion with the patient and her family. A course of radiotherapy was initiated using conformal fractionated techniques (ExacTrac; Brainlab) for maximal normal tissue sparing (fractionated external beam radiotherapy via rapid arc to 50.4 Gy) in 28 fractions administered over a 2-month period. Six months later, her visual acuity was counting fingers OD and 20/300 OS.This case emphasizes the importance of considering ONSM in the differential diagnosis of bilateral optic nerve atrophy in children and teens. It is crucial to understand that the goal of radiotherapy is to halt the progression of the disease. Two years after radiotherapy, the patient’s visual acuity was 20/630 OD and 20/400 OS. Repeated MRI of the brain and orbit showed stability and no further worsening of vision.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits did not show evidence of orbital extension. The patient underwent an incisional biopsy, which revealed extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated tissues on histopathology and immunohistochemistry. A staging computed tomography scan showed no adenopathy elsewhere, and radiation therapy of the orbit was therefore recommended. The patient completed a course of radiation for a total dose of 2400 cGy. Subconjunctival mass in the fornix prior to biopsy.Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma is the most frequent type of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma occurring in the conjunctiva. It typically presents in patients 70 years and older as a slow-growing salmon patch lesion in the fornix, with a slight predominance in women. Its pathogenesis is thought to involve chronic inflammation from antigenic stimulation, infection, or autoimmune processes.1Terrien marginal degeneration is a slowly progressive, commonly bilateral, painless degenerative ectasia of the peripheral cornea, occurring most often in men older than 40 years.2 It is most frequently seen in the superior cornea, where stromal thinning or furrowing with lipid deposition at the leading anterior edge is seen. Vision loss due to irregular against-the-rule astigmatism and, in rare cases, perforations can occur. Treatment options generally entail correction of the astigmatism with a rigid gas permeable contact lens, lamellar keratoplasty, or corneal patch graft if perforation is imminent. While the exact mechanism behind the condition is unknown, inflammation is generally not a prominent feature,3 unlike with Mooren ulcer, although some studies suggest an inflammatory variant.4,5 This case was less typical for Terrien degeneration in that it was completely unilateral and that it eventually developed pronounced inflammation and neovascularization.In cases of lipid keratopathy from corneal neovascularization without another known cause, there have been reports of regression of both vessels and lipids after injections of subconjunctival anti–vascular endothelial growth factor  agents, such as bevacizumab.6 In this patient, this was not the treatment of choice, as the patient had another, more pressing diagnosis that was likely contributing to the corneal findings.In this patient, it is possible that indolent, chronic inflammation from the cornea served as antigenic stimulation for the formation of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma in the adjacent conjunctiva. On the other hand, a paraneoplastic syndrome or secondary lipid deposition from pathologic neovascularization attributable to the extranodal marginal zone lymphoma can also be considered.7 Regardless of the etiology of this atypical corneal degeneration, results from this case highlight the importance of a thorough examination of the ocular surface and fornices.On repeated examinations 2 and 6 months thereafter, his visual acuity improved to 20/25 OD without any evidence of recurrence of the subconjunctival mass.

When questioned, the patient recalled a rat bite 3 days before symptom onset. Based on this history, pustule fluid and blood were submitted for culture. Blood cultures became positive, and Gram stain revealed filamentous gram-negative bacilli in “nests,” with occasional bulbous swellings. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry failed to identify the organism, but 16S rDNA sequencing identified Streptobacillus moniliformis, the causative agent of rat bite fever. No growth occurred from pustule fluid cultures.Because of the nonspecific presentation of rat bite fever, patients with a high index of clinical suspicion should be carefully questioned for rodent exposure.1 Even without a known exposure, rat bite fever should be considered in patients with an unexplained febrile illness and rash, arthritis, or risk factors such as occupational or recreational exposure to rodents.2 The duration of the patient’s symptoms and absence of oral symptoms made the diagnosis of hand, foot, and mouth disease due to enterovirus unlikely. Although testing for tick-transmitted diseases or joint fluid analysis may eventually be warranted, the next best step is obtaining a thorough history regarding exposure to rodents. This approach improves pretest probability and avoids premature conclusions by developing a focused differential diagnosis based on history and examination.3Rat bite fever is caused by S moniliformis in the United States or Spirillum minus in Asia. S moniliformis is a fastidious, facultatively anaerobic, filamentous gram-negative bacteria that colonizes the oral and nasopharyngeal tracts of rats, mice, squirrels, gerbils, and other rodents. Rat bite fever is not a notifiable disease in the United States, and, while incidence appears low, its precise incidence is unknown.1 However, infections are increasing, especially in children, because of the popularity of rodents as pets.4 Transmission also occurs by ingesting food contaminated by urine of colonized rats, causing a syndrome known as “Haverhill fever.”5Rat bite fever is characterized by fever, chills, headache, and vomiting 3 to 10 days after exposure. Without treatment, fever typically follows a relapsing-remitting pattern. Most patients develop a maculopapular, petechial, or purpuric rash, especially on the extensor surfaces of the extremities and extending to the hands and feet. Lesions can evolve into pustules and hemorrhagic vesicles. Most patients develop migratory polyarthralgias involving both small and large joints.1Rodent bite wounds should be thoroughly cleansed, and antibiotic prophylaxis and tetanus immunization may be warranted if not up to date. Rabies prophylaxis is almost never indicated for small rodent bites.6 Symptoms of rat bite fever can present early, but diagnosis is usually delayed or missed because of poor memory of rodent exposure. Additionally, the nonspecific presentation may mimic viral infections, sexually transmitted infections, drug reactions, and vasculitis.1,7S moniliformis is fastidious, and its growth is inhibited by an anticoagulant used in blood cultures. In this patient, growth occurred in the aerobic blood culture bottle but only on anaerobic solid media. No special incubation or plating strategies were used for the blood cultures, but supplemented culture methods have historically been recommended to identify S moniliformis.1 There should be communication with the microbiology laboratory to optimize the diagnostic approach for patients with suspected rat bite fever. Identification of cultured S moniliformis is challenging, as it may not be present in commercial identification databases. Definitive identification may require specialized biochemical analysis,1 sequencing, or both.Infectious diseases consultation can assist with risk assessment, laboratory communication to optimize testing, and choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy. Penicillin is the treatment of choice when diagnosis is confirmed; cephalosporins and tetracyclines may also be effective. Rat bite fever can be associated with serious complications including endocarditis, hepatitis, nephritis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, and sepsis. When diagnosed, rat bite fever can be successfully treated; however, mortality can reach 13% without treatment.7-10,The patient was initially treated with penicillin and doxycycline empirically. After the diagnosis of rat bite fever, treatment was changed to intravenous penicillin G monotherapy. Transthoracic echocardiography did not reveal valvular vegetations. Persistent back pain prompted magnetic resonance imaging of the spine, which revealed changes consistent with lumbar osteomyelitis. Treatment was extended to 6 weeks, and the patient’s symptoms resolved without need for repeat imaging.",JAMA Clinical Challenge ,Gram stain of blood culture is shown in the Figure (right panel).Obtain joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures What Would You Do Next?,non-binary,539,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

Given the constellation of branch retinal artery occlusion, severe headache, and auditory changes, this was diagnostic for Susac syndrome. Vasculitic workup findings were negative for other causes.Susac syndrome is a rare disorder of the retinal, cochlear, and cerebral microvasculature, with 300 reported cases since its description in 1973.1 Classically defined as a triad of encephalopathy, retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss, it has a predilection for women (3:1) particularly between ages 20 and 40 years.Headache is the most common presenting symptom, occurring in approximately 78% of people.1 Central nervous system involvement manifests as psychiatric disturbances, confusion, and dementia. These symptoms may unfold over weeks to months. Forty percent of cases have evidence of retinal arteritis; however, this increases to 97% throughout the course of disease.1 The prolonged time course, varying neurologic symptoms, and often vague visual symptoms lend Susac syndrome to misdiagnosis. This patient falls into the subset of cases with ophthalmic disease as the initial symptom.This disease is thought to derive from immune-mediated endothelial injury of small arterioles less than 100 µm in diameter as histopathology demonstrates endothelial cell necrosis and anti–endothelial cell antibodies.2 Humoral autoimmunity may take part in the pathogenesis as antiendothelial cell IgG1 and IgM antibodies have been detected in some affected patients.3 However, there are no recommendations for the routine use of these serological tests.All patients with suspected Susac syndrome should receive fluorescein angiography, as it may detect subtle microangiopathy not seen on examination. Egan et al4 suggested that segments of arterial hyperfluorescence represent focal endotheliopathy, which may be invisible on examination, in contrast to other vasculitides. Yellow arterial plaques, called Gass plaques, may develop from lipid leakage from chronically damaged vessel walls. Gass plaques are found distant from arterial bifurcations in contrast to Hollenhorst plaques. Echocardiogram and carotid ultrasonography are unnecessary as these findings are not embolic in nature.Brain magnetic resonance imaging is of utmost importance and should not be delayed by such testing as audiometry. In the context of encephalopathy, corpus callosal lesions are pathognomonic for Susac syndrome, as the diagnosis can be made even without retinal artery occlusions or auditory changes.5 Often called snowballs, these microinfarctions are best seen on sagittal T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. Microinfarctions affecting the internal capsule may also give a string-of-pearls appearance on diffusion-weighted imaging.Corticosteroids, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathiopurine, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis have been used to manage this condition.6 The low incidence of this condition and lack of controlled studies limit the ability to create definitive treatment guidelines.In this patient, systemic steroids were initiated and her symptoms improved.

Osteosarcoma metastasis,C,Osteosarcoma metastasis,"Pathologic analysis revealed metastatic osteosarcoma in a 6.5-cm mass. The mass showed apparent bony tissue.Metastases to the thyroid gland are reported at autopsy in 1% to 24% of metastatic cancer patients.1,2 The most common sites were kidney, lung, breast, esophagus, and uterus.3-5 Some studies showed that the most common primary tumor for thyroid metastases was lung cancer4,6,7; however, some showed renal cell carcinoma.3,8 Review articles concluded that lung and renal cell carcinomas made up more than 80% of total thyroid gland metastases. Unlike uterine cancer, cancer of the cervix is not a common primary source for thyroid metastasis. Unlike the considerable predominance of primary thyroid cancers in women, some studies have found male,1 some have found female,3 and some studies have found no gender predominance4,5 for metastasis to the thyroid gland.The majority of patients presented with clinical complaints, such as new-onset neck swelling, dysphagia, dysphonia, and cough.8 Clinical differential diagnosis for a rapidly enlarging unilateral thyroid mass includes anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), thyroid lymphoma or sarcoma, metastasis to the thyroid gland, and abscess. Differential diagnosis for pathology should include osteosarcoma, sarcomatoid PDTC, ATC with osseous metaplasia, medullary thyroid carcinoma, spindle epithelial tumor with thymus-like differentiation, and synovial sarcoma.9 The cytological image may be ambiguous and requires histopathological confirmation, supported by immunohistochemical examinations.Sarcomas are derived from mesenchymal cells, such as bone, fat, and muscle. Sarcomas of the thyroid, both primary and metastatic, are rare. Osteosarcomas express vimentin; leiomyosarcomas express vimentin, desmin, and smooth-muscle actin. Unlike PDTC, ATC often displays p53 mutations and does not stain for thyroglobulin and often not vimentin. Osteosarcoma may be positive for p53.Metastases of primary tumors can be divided into 2 categories: synchronous and metachronous. Synchronous indicates that the tumors are detected at the same time as the thyroid metastases, whereas metachronous indicates that the thyroid metastases are detected some time after the primary tumor was detected. The mean interval between discovery of the primary tumor and the thyroid metastases was 5.8 years.8 Our patient presented with thyroid gland metastasis after 4 years of disease-free survival without other metastasis apparent on PET-CT examination.We recommend neck ultrasonography for all thyroid enlargement as a first step for imaging. However, in selected cases, CT or PET-CT may be considered initially if clinical suspicion is high for nonthyroid causes such as metastases.In patients with clinically suspected metastasis to the thyroid gland, core-needle biopsy achieved a significantly higher sensitivity than fine-needle biopsy without any false-negative results.10 In cases of known rare primary malignant abnormality, nontypical ultrasonography features of primary thyroid malignant abnormality, and need for an additional immunohistochemical analysis, core-needle biopsy may be primarily considered.10 In this case, we deferred biopsy considering highly calcified tissue on CT imaging and likelihood of osteosarcoma metastasis with previous history of osteosarcoma.The treatment is surgical excision of the lesion with or without lymph node dissection. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy is also considered in selected cases of local recurrence or concomitant metastases. Surgical treatment was associated with improved survival duration.3 The incidence of surgical complications was very low and did not vary by extent of surgical treatment. The most common surgical complications are injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and incomplete resection of the metastasis. In 1 review,5 no patients had tumor recurrence when margins were negative. In light of these data, subtotal thyroidectomy may be warranted unless there is concern for involvement of the contralateral lobe. However, another review3 found that recurrence was more likely in patients treated with subtotal thyroidectomies (13.3%) vs total thyroidectomies (4.8%).Metastasis of osteosarcoma to the thyroid gland is rare. It is important to consider thyroid metastases in the differential diagnosis in thyroid nodules, especially in patients with a medical history of malignant abnormality and rapidly enlarging thyroid mass.

Extrafacial granuloma faciale,B,Extrafacial granuloma faciale,"The biopsy results revealed a mixed dermal infiltrate with eosinophils, neutrophils, and plasma cells, and a nonleukocytoclastic vasculitic component without epidermal changes. The histologic appearance was compatible with extrafacial granuloma faciale (GF).Granuloma faciale is a chronic, benign, and infrequent inflammatory skin disease of unknown origin. It usually manifests as a solitary reddish-violet plaque on the face, and extrafacial involvement may occur; other potential locations include the ears, scalp, trunk, and limbs.1,2 Lesion size varies from several millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. The lesions are usually smooth on the surface and can often present with superficial telangiectasias and prominent follicular orifices, which sometimes show an orange peel appearance.3 Granuloma faciale can be divided into plaque or nodular types, with the latter being generally resistant to therapy.4In a retrospective analysis of 66 patients with GF, i27 (41.5%) patients presented with a nodule, 25 (38%) had multiple lesions, 6 (9%) had extrafacial involvement alone, and 1 (1.5%) had facial and extrafacial involvement.5 Some studies have included GF in the spectrum of IgG4-related diseases.1-4 Although the precise pathogenesis remains unknown, interferon-γ and increased local production of interleukin 5 may be important mediators.1Granuloma faciale is characterized by a diffuse polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate that mainly affects the upper half of the dermis.5,6 The histologic characteristics of leukocytoclastic vasculitis are more prominent in the beginning, with older lesions tending to have fewer neutrophils and more eosinophils and plasma cells, as well as fibrosis.1 The clinical appearance of GF is distinctive, but the differential diagnosis may include lymphoma, persistent arthropod bite reactions, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia, tumid lupus erythematosus, erythema elevatum diutinum, and various granulomatous disorders.Treatment for this condition is limited. First-line therapies include corticosteroids (intralesional injection or topical), topical use of tacrolimus, or complete surgical removal.Sweet syndrome is characterized by a constellation of clinical symptoms that include high fever and sensitive erythematous cutaneous lesions that are usually painful. Histopathologic results reveal a dense neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. In this case, the patient did not comply with the necessary criteria.7 In contrast, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is characterized by papules or nodules with an angiomatoid aspect and that are predominantly located on the head, especially around the ears. The histopathologic characteristics of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia include abnormal vascular proliferation formed by capillaries grouped around arterial or venous vessels, with lymphocytic infiltrates with eosinophils instead of a mixed dermal infiltrate.8Localized cutaneous leishmaniasis tends to occur in exposed areas of the skin and begins as a pink papule which gets bigger and becomes a nodule or a lesion similar to a plaque. The distinctive differences between GF and leishmaniasis are its clinical presentation and the evolution of the lesion; treatment for leishmaniasis can take months or years. In addition, the histopathologic results include a granulomatous infiltrate in the dermis and the presence of amastigotes in the acute phase of infection.9,10Herein, we present a rare case of nodular extrafacial GF. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion, with no recurrence reported. This condition should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic plaques or nodules in the ears, scalp, trunk, and/or extremities, particularly in middle-aged men.",JAMA Dermatology Clinicopathological Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,non-binary,433,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>
B
I've chosen option B because the patient is presenting with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has a history of recurrent UTIs. Nitrofurantoin is a commonly used antibiotic for UTIs and has a high efficacy rate. Additionally, it has a low risk of adverse effects and is safe for use in pregnancy, which is important given the patient's current status.

Note: Option A (amoxicillin) is not the best choice for a UTI as it is less effective against the bacteria commonly responsible for UTIs. Option C (ciprofloxacin) is a good choice for UTIs but has a higher risk of adverse effects and is not recommended for use in pregnancy. Option D (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is also a good choice for UTIs but has a higher risk of adverse effects and is not recommended for use in pregnancy.",10.540157794952393,"You are an AI assistant acting as a healthcare professional tasked with analyzing complex clinical cases and selecting the most appropriate treatment option.
