On current presentation, she had erythematous annular and indurated plaques on her face, trunk, and extremities (Supplement). Laboratory testing revealed positive cardiolipin IgM (150 U/mL [reference, <13 U/mL]) and cardiolipin IgG (40 U/mL [reference, <15 U/mL]) antibodies. RPR titer was 1:1024. Skin biopsy revealed a dense perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells. The patient was not taking any new prescriptions or over-the-counter medications and did not use herbal supplements. She had no history of sexually transmitted infections and was sexually active with 1 male partner for the past 12 months \\n *How Do You Interpret These Test Results?* \\n A.

      "The question is: A white man in his 50s initially presented in the fall of 2015 with “macular changes” noticed by his referring optometrist. The patient was asymptomatic at the time. He had a history of hypertension and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which was last treated in 2012 without evidence of recurrence. His visual acuity was 20/25 OU, and neither fundus was seen to be abnormal. The vitreous was clear in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed vitreomacular adhesion in the right eye and a macular posterior vitreous detachment in the left. The patient was told to follow-up as needed.About 2 months later, the patient called on the telephone to say that he had a new onset of blurry vision and photopsias in the right eye that started about 2 days prior. He denied any recent viral-type illness. An examination revealed that his visual acuity was still 20/25 OU. The anterior segment and the anterior vitreous of his right eye were still clear. However, an examination of the posterior pole of the right eye revealed a light white, deep subretinal/choroidal ring surrounding the optic nerve, with smaller rings around the edge of the larger ring (Figure, A). The left eye still appeared normal. Optical coherence tomography of the right eye revealed loss of the outer retina (more nasal than temporal to the fovea), whereas OCT of the left eye revealed that it was normal (Figure, B). The results of fluorescein angiography and fundus autofluorescence were both unremarkable (data not shown).A, Fundus photograph of the right eye at the time of presentation shows a white-gray ring centered on the optic nerve. B, Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the right eye reveals significant loss of the outer retina, especially nasal to the fovea. What Would You Do Next?\n",

      "The question is: A young adult nonsmoker patient with a history of asthma presented with a palpable mass on the left side of the neck that had been present for several months, reportedly unchanged. The patient had been treated presumptively for infection with antibiotics, with no improvement. No fever, odynophagia, dysphagia, otalgia, or other constitutional symptoms were reported. Physical examination findings demonstrated a palpable, soft, nontender left level II/III neck mass. Clinical examination findings of the thyroid and upper aerodigestive tract were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) showed a large avidly enhancing mass centered at the left carotid bifurcation splaying the internal and external carotid arteries and extending cranially along the cervical internal carotid artery. The left internal jugular vein was displaced posteriorly. There was also a smaller mass with similar appearance at the right carotid bifurcation (Figure 1A). Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed several enhancing masses in the liver (not shown). Based on CT findings, gallium Ga 68 (68Ga) dotatate positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed; results demonstrated intense radiotracer avidity in bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions (Figure 1B).A, Axial contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) demonstrates large left (black asterisk) and small right (white arrowhead) avidly enhancing bilateral carotid space masses. The left tumor circumferentially encases the left external carotid artery (black arrowhead) and partially encases the left internal carotid artery (yellow arrowhead). B, Coronal gallium 68 dotatate positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) demonstrates intense radiotracer uptake of bilateral carotid space masses (left, black asterisk; right, white arrowhead), hepatic masses (black arrowhead), and CT occult osseous lesions as seen in the right femoral neck (yellow arrowhead).

      "The question is: A woman in her 40s had experienced dizziness and headache to the vertex with left retro-orbital irradiation for 1 year. She referred only to minor head trauma 15 years earlier. Findings from a physical examination were negative, while nasal endoscopy showed diffuse mucous rhinorrhea. A CT scan of the paranasal sinuses showed complete opacification of the left sphenoid sinus, a double-lined appearance of the sinus walls (an inner bony sclerotic layer and a thin external one) (Figure, A), and 2 bony defects of the sphenoid sinus walls next to the cavernous sinus along the floor (Figure, B). An MRI scan showed a concentric multistratified appearance of the sinus content. On T2-weighted images (Figure, C), a hyperintense line peripheral layer consistent with fluid retention, an irregularly thick hypointense line, consistent with the sclerotic bone visible on CT, a crescent-shaped heterogeneous material in the lower part, and a black oval area in the upper part of the sinus were identified. After gadolinium administration, volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) sequences revealed very intense enhancement of the oval black area in the upper part of the sinus, with no contrast enhancement of the remainder of the sinus (Figure, D). On paracoronal images, there was no cleavage plane between the hyperenhancing area in the sphenoid sinus and the bright signal of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in the cavernous sinus.Intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery  What Is Your Diagnosis?\n",

      "The question is: A 58-year-old woman with a history of intravenous heroin use and chronic inactive hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with a low serum HBV DNA value, normal liver enzyme values, and no evidence of cirrhosis presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of painless jaundice and 8 days of malaise. Her last intravenous heroin use occurred 9 days prior to presentation. She was not taking any prescription or herbal medications and had not been prescribed suppressive antiviral medication for chronic HBV infection. She reported no history of travel outside the US and no raw meat ingestion. Her vital signs, mentation, and physical examination were normal except for scleral icterus (Figure). Results of blood testing were negative for hepatitis C virus RNA, anti–hepatitis A IgM, and HIV antibody. Other selected laboratory values are shown in the Table. A liver ultrasound performed 6 months prior to presentation and a repeat liver ultrasound with Doppler revealed no abnormalities.Order testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibodyOrder testing for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, test for HDV RNA What Would You Do Next?\n",

      "The question is: A man in his 60s presented to a tertiary care center after several months of having right-sided lateral neck pain. He described the pain as “electric” and “stabbing.” He reported no numbness of the region and had not experienced any other symptoms, including new neck masses. His medical history was significant for obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, a right ear skin cancer excised by a dermatologist, and coronary artery disease with angina on stress test. His physical examination revealed a well-healed excision site of the right ear without new skin lesions. His facial nerve was fully intact. He had full strength of the shoulder and no numbness of the right ear or cheek. Palpation of the lateral neck demonstrated a mass running along the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an elongated enhancing tubular structure along the lateral surface of the right SCM muscle (Figure 1).A and B, Anterior to posterior coronal fat-saturated T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with an enhancing tubular mass of the right side of the neck (yellow arrowhead) that extends posterior and deep to sternocleidomastoid (SCM) (blue arrowheads).

      "The question is: A woman in her 30s presented with a 3-month history of painful swelling of the left hard palate and cheek. The growth also caused malocclusion and ipsilateral upper lip numbness. She reported no recent trauma; no difficulty speaking, breathing, or swallowing; no epistaxis, nasal congestion or nasal drainage; and no recent fevers. She did have a history of recent pericoronitis, but several courses of antibiotics were unhelpful. Physical examination revealed a submucosal growth centered on the mesial aspect of the left maxillary alveolus. Transnasal endoscopy was unremarkable. Contrasted computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneously ossified lesion filling the left maxillary sinus, with local destruction of hard palate and alveolar bone (Figure, A and B). Positron emission tomographic scans highlighted the fluorodeoxyglucose-avid nature of both the tumor and associated cervical lymphadenopathy. A biopsy showed a tumor with lobular architecture, an incomplete peripheral ossified rim (Figure, C), and focal areas of osteoid matrix. Higher power showed atypical cells with increased mitotic activity in a myxoid stroma (Figure, D). Immunostains were negative for S100, pankeratin AE1/AE3, SMSA, and GFAP.A, Computed tomographic (CT) image of the head, coronal view.

      "The question is: A 69-year-old man with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the left parotid gland had undergone left parotidectomy and modified neck dissection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy 12 years previously. Ten years later, he developed a second primary tumor in the hypopharynx requiring total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection. He presented with new-onset headaches, left ear pain, and persistent unsteadiness during the previous month. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy, neurological deficits, or mastoid tenderness, and otoscopic examination results of the tympanic membrane appeared normal.Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed an enhancing lesion in the left infratemporal fossa (3.4 × 3.4 × 2.8 cm) abutting the cerebellum, and subsequent computed tomographic imaging of the head demonstrated osseous destruction of the left temporal bone extending along the left internal jugular vein (Figure, A). Fine-needle aspiration of the left mastoid showed atypical spindle cells. The patient underwent tumor excision with a left infratemporal approach. A large mass with rubbery texture was noted, extending into the jugular foramen and adherent to the dura mater without evidence of intradural invasion. The lower cranial nerves were identified, and the mass was resected to the external wall of the jugular bulb. The patient tolerated the procedure without complications or neurological deficits. Histopathologic assessment demonstrated myogenin-positive spindle cells with no tumor necrosis (Figure, B and C). In addition, the tumor expressed desmin-positive and CD34-positive cells. The tumor focally infiltrated into the fibrous tissue, skeletal muscle, and bone.A, Axial computed tomography of the head and neck demonstrating osseous destruction of the left temporal bone.

      "The question is: A 47-year-old woman, with dyslipidemia, presented to the emergency department with sudden vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior segment, tonometry, and pupillary light reflex were unremarkable. Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye showed discretely blurred optic disc margins, tortuous and dilated retinal veins, and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants; the left eye was unremarkable. An optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan showed a cystoid macular edema (CME) in the right eye; the left was unremarkable. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was 133 μm OD and 82 μm OS (reference value, 95.4 ± 10.48 μm).1 A fluorescein angiography was scheduled. One week later, the patient returned to our department due to multiple episodes of amaurosis fugax in left eye. By that time, ophthalmoscopy disclosed a mild optic disc swelling, tortuous venous vessels, and retinal hemorrhages bilaterally (Figure 1). The OCT scan showed a CME spontaneous resolution in the right eye while the left eye was unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography revealed a slight delay in venous filling but no capillary nonperfusion areas. These features were compatible with bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye.Fundus photography of the right and left eyes showing slightly elevated and blurred optic disc margins (asterisk), mildly tortuous and dilated retinal vessels (black arrowheads), and intraretinal hemorrhages (pink arrowheads) in all quadrants in both eyes. In the left eye, a superficial optic nerve drusen (white arrowhead) was noted.A hypercoagulability and autoimmune workup—including peripheral blood smear, complete blood cell count, serum hyperviscosity, total protein level, protein electrophoresis, factor V Leiden, prothrombin, protein C and S, antithrombin, anticardiolipin, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies—gave normal results. A brain angiomagnetic resonance imaging scan was performed, which excluded central thrombosis. What Would You Do Next?\n",

      "The question is: A  man in his late 70s presented with a 1-month history of blurry vision in his left eye. He reported fatigue, muscle stiffness, joint pain, and a 10-lb unintentional weight loss. On ocular examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/60 OS. Anterior segment examination findings were unremarkable.Fundus examination revealed bilateral microaneurysms and dot hemorrhages throughout the posterior pole, along with bilateral macular edema and serous neurosensory detachment in the left eye (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography of the right eye revealed severe cystoid macular edema, and fluorescein angiography showed normal filling with multiple microaneurysms. An optical coherence tomographic image of the left eye showed a large neurosensory detachment with overlying and surrounding cystoid macular edema. Fluorescein angiography of the left eye demonstrated hypofluorescence without pooling or leakage of fluorescein dye over the area of neurosensory detachment, which was persistent in later frames (Figure 1B).A, Fundus photograph of left eye showing neurosensory detachment.

      "The question is: A man in his 30s presented with a 5-day history of vomiting, followed by lethargy and confusion. Two years prior, he was hospitalized with coma with no identifiable precipitant and an extensive workup done at that time only revealed an elevated ammonia level of 233 µg/dL (to convert to µmol/L, multiply by 0.714); etiology remained unclear but he improved with lactulose. Prior to this admission, he was working in a restaurant, did not ingest any drugs or mushrooms, and had no operations and no family history of similar problems. He was found to have hyperammonemia to 239.5 µg/dL and respiratory alkalosis (pH level, 7.482; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 27.3 mm Hg, and partial pressure of oxygen, 109 mm Hg [to convert to kPa, multiply by 0.133]; and bicarbonate, 20.2 mEq/L [to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1]). Liver and kidney function were normal (protein, 6.4 g/dL, and albumin, 3.4 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10]; direct bilirubin, 0.1 mg/dL, and indirect bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL [to convert to µmol/L, multiply by 17.104]; alkaline phosphatase, 38 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase, 22 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase, 42 U/L [to convert to µkat/L, mutiply by 0.0167]). His mental status rapidly declined despite treatment with lactulose, necessitating intubation. Head computed tomography and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were unrevealing. Ammonia levels progressively increased to 1120.5 µg/dL, requiring hemodialysis and sodium phenylbutyrate, which did not lead to significant clinical improvement. On hospital day 6, he developed continuous myoclonus due to status epilepticus (Figure 1A), which was refractory to treatment with lorazepam and levetiracetam as well as continuous midazolam, lorazepam, and propofol infusions. Plasma amino acids and urine organic acids were requested. Continuous venovenous filtration hemodialysis and carnitine treatment were started because of concern for inborn errors of metabolism. Within a few hours of transfer, his ammonia level peaked to 1960 µg/dL and he lost all brainstem activity due to diffuse cerebral edema (Figure 1B).A, Electroencephalography (EEG) showing diffuse polyspike complexes consistent with myoclonic seizures. B, Head computed tomography showing diffuse cerebral edema, obliteration of basal cisterns, and transtentorial and tonsillar herniation. What Is Your Diagnosis?\n",
