Examination was notable for a superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye. Results of the fundus examination were reported to be normal in both eyes and the anterior examination of the left eye was notable for only a well-positioned PCIOL.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic , specialty evaluation occurred 10 weeks later at which time the woman complained of progressive vision loss in the right eye . Visual acuity measured hand motion in the right eye with normal intraocular pressure . The PCIOL was subluxed inferotemporally with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber ( Figure 1A ) . A 4 mm   ×   3.1 - mm superonasal pigmented scleral lesion was also noted ( Figure 1B ) . The examination of the left eye was remarkable only for a well - centered PCIOL and iris transillumination defects . A , Slitlamp photography of the right eye showing the inferotemporal intraocular lens implant subluxation ( arrowhead ) .\n",
