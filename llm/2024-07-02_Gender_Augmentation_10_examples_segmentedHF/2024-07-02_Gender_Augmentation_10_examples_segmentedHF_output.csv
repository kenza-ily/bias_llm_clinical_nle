https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2734819,"A man in his late 30s with a history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy presented for evaluation of sudden-onset painless blurry vision of the right eye. His ocular history included nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye requiring pars plana vitrectomy, panretinal photocoagulation, multiple treatments with intravitreous bevacizumab, and cataract extraction with placement of an intraocular lens (IOL) into the capsular bag approximately 4 years ago. At his routine follow-up visit 2 weeks prior, the proliferative diabetic retinopathy was quiescent, and his Snellen visual acuity was 20/20 OD with manifest refraction of −1.50 + 0.25 × 180. Examination of the anterior segment at that time was unremarkable.At his current visit, visual acuity with the previous correction had been reduced to 20/150. Repeated manifest refraction of the right eye was −4.00 + 1.50 × 166, resulting in a visual acuity of 20/25. Intraocular pressure of the right eye was 10 mm Hg by Goldmann applanation tonometry. Evaluation of the posterior segment, including dilated fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula, showed stability compared with previous results. Imaging of the anterior segment with OCT is shown in Figure 1.",Perform posterior capsulotomy as part of pars plana vitrectomy,Perform posterior capsulotomy with Nd:YAG laser,Exchange the IOL,Observe the patient,Capsular bag distention syndrome,B,Perform posterior capsulotomy with Nd:YAG laser,"The key to diagnosis is recognizing hyperdistention of the capsular bag with a turbid milieu posterior to the IOL (Figure 1) along with a myopic shift. Anterior segment OCT confirmed the diagnosis. Performing a posterior capsulotomy would allow egress of the turbid material into the vitreous cavity and provide immediate resolution of the refractive change with minimal risk. If this was not successful, we would then perform a posterior capsulotomy during pars plana vitrectomy (choice A). Exchanging the IOL (choice C) is not preferred because decreasing the new lens power to compensate for the myopic shift would result in a hyperopic surprise, as the procedure itself would resolve the capsular bag distention syndrome (CBDS). Observation (choice D) is preferable when the patient does not want intervention; however, the myopic shift needs to be corrected with an updated manifest refraction.Capsular bag distention syndrome, also known as capsular block syndrome, is a rare complication after phacoemulsification and placement of an IOL into the capsular bag.1,2 It is characterized by the accumulation of opaque fluid within the potential space between the posterior aspect of the IOL and the intact posterior capsule. Capsular bag distention syndrome is classified as intraoperative, early-onset, or late-onset on the basis of time of onset.3 Intraoperative CBDS occurs with lens luxation following hydrodissection. Early-onset CBDS is associated with retained viscoelastic materials. Late-onset CBDS is caused by residual cortical cells secreting alpha-crystallin proteins, which creates a turbid milieu that slowly accumulates and distends the posterior capsule.4 Patients with diabetes are not at increased risk for this syndrome. Although intraoperative and early-onset forms of CBDS are often associated with high intraocular pressure and shallowing of the anterior chamber, these features may be absent in the late-onset form.5 This patient presented with late-onset CBDS, demonstrating symptomatic visual acuity decline approximately 4 years after cataract surgery.Although CBDS can be diagnosed clinically, the value of using anterior segment OCT has been previously reported.6 The combination of increased refractive index of the turbid milieu along with convex configuration of the hyperdistended capsular bag forms a plus lens effect that causes a myopic shift, as experienced by this patient.Capsular bag distention syndrome can often be treated with Nd:YAG laser–assisted posterior capsulotomy, as this quick in-office procedure evacuates the turbid milieu from the capsular bag and resolves symptoms almost immediately.5,7 When an infectious etiology, in particular Propionibacterium acnes, is suspected, use of pars plana vitrectomy is necessary to surgically remove the contents of the bag, along with possible IOL exchange and/or injection of intraocular antibiotics.8,9 In this patient, there were no clinical findings of intraocular inflammation or capsular plaques to suggest infection.This patient underwent uneventful Nd:YAG laser–assisted posterior capsulotomy of the right eye; 1 hour after the procedure, the intraocular pressure was 11 mm Hg by applanation. Within 10 minutes after the procedure, the patient reported noticeably improved distance vision in the right eye. Repeated manifest refraction showed resolution of the myopic shift. Clinical examination revealed absence of the hyperdistended capsular bag or turbid fluid, which was confirmed on repeated anterior segment OCT (Figure 2).Anterior segment optical coherence tomography image showing the lens capsule complex after Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy.",JAMA Ophthalmology Clinical Challenge ,"The anterior chamber did not appear shallow, and there was no cell or flare.Slitlamp photograph of the anterior segment (A) and optical coherence tomographic imaging of the lens–capsular bag complex (B) obtained at initial presentation (arrowheads show hyperdistention of the capsular bag with turbid fluid).Perform posterior capsulotomy as part of pars plana vitrectomy What Would You Do Next?",male,506,original,"<answer>

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2496495,"A young woman presented with a 4-month history of a 2.0-cm mass in her right supraclavicular region. She had a cough and fatigue at the time, but no other symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection at onset. She attributed her fatigue to staying up late studying and had not tried any treatments, including antibiotics. She denied any trauma, night sweats, fever, chills, weight loss, generalized pruritus or lymphadenopathy in other areas of her body, any voice change, dysphagia, odynophagia, hoarseness, hemoptysis, hematemesis, or weight loss. Her family history was positive for breast cancer in her mother, and the patient was a lifelong nonsmoker. Physical examination revealed palpable nontender, freely movable mass in the right supraclavicular region. Palpation of the parotid, submandibular glands, and thyroid gland did not reveal any suspicious masses or tenderness. No mucosal lesions, scars, or masses were found on intraoral examination, with clear oropharynx. Computed tomography revealed a 2.0-cm, right-sided supraclavicular mass just anterior and superior to the right subclavian vein with central patches of hypoattenuation (Figure, A). Results from initial ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration were nondiagnostic. Subsequent ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy on supraclavicular aspirate showed a benign spindle cell proliferation arranged in a tissue-culture–like pattern with a myxoid to collagenous stroma (Figures, B and C). Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated the cells to be positive for actin and negative for cytokeratin and S100 protein.",Proliferative myositis,Myositis ossificans,Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma,Nodular fasciitis,D. Nodular fasciitis,D,Nodular fasciitis,"First described in 1955 by Konwaler et al,1 nodular fasciitis is a rapidly growing benign soft-tissue mass characterized by abundant cellularity, rapid growth, and high mitotic activity. Located in either the deep subcutaneous tissues or superficial fascia, nodular fasciitis is a nonneoplastic proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Although the pathological and clinical presentation resembles that of malignant soft-tissue sarcomas, often leading to misdiagnosis, the condition is benign. The etiology of nodular fasciitis is uncertain, with some proposing that it is a reactive process associated with trauma, while others describe it as a self-limiting clonal process with neoplastic origins.2 Originally called pseudosarcomatous fibromatosis, other terms, such as nodular pseudosarcomatous fasciitis, pseudosarcomatous fasciitis, infiltrative fasciitis, or proliferative fasciitis may be used to refer to the same disease process.Nodular fasciitis preferentially affects adults (in 80% of cases), usually within the first 2 to 4 decades of life with a slight male predominance.3 Although rare in children, it can present as a chest wall tumor in children (it constitutes 1.8% of all childhood solid chest wall tumors),4 and should considered as a diagnosis. After surgical excision, local recurrence has been documented but is rare.5Most lesions are subcutaneous and circumscribed, lending them amenable to biopsy or excision. Patients notice a rapidly growing, subcutaneous painless mass over the course of 3 to 6 weeks. Masses are solid, nodular, firm, or rubbery and usually plateau at 2.0 to 3.0 cm, rarely exceeding 4.0 cm. The upper extremities are the most common area of presentation, especially the flexor aspect of the forearm. They are less frequently found on the trunk (20%), head and neck (20%), and lower extremities (13%),3 and may have an associated history of trauma.6 In the head and neck region, lesions are often found on the neck or face and less rarely on the forehead and/or scalp or around the eyes.3Histologically, nodular fasciitis demonstrates nonneoplastic proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, although there is a vast array of presentation pattern. The cellular composition of the mass can further divide nodular fasciitis into 3 subtypes: type 1 (myxoid), type 2 (cellular), and type 3 (fibrotic).6 The subtype of nodular fasciitis diagnosed may be dependent on the duration the lesion has been present, because fibrotic type may represent the most mature and longest-lasting lesions.6Type 1 has fibroblast-like cells within a stroma rich in collagen and/or myxoid ground substance. This type tends to form a large tumor, occurs more frequently in older patients, and appears similar to the myxoid variant of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Type 2 has significantly less ground substance and stroma, with large, plump, fibroblast-like spindle cells that have vesicular nuclei. The high cellular proliferation and mitotic activity most closely resembles sarcomatous lesions. Type 3 most closely resembles other benign lesions and has more spindle-shaped, slender fibroblast-like cells and increased collagen production.6The tumor’s rapid presentation and histological profile closely resembles that of sarcomas, often leading to misdiagnosis. Beyond sarcomas, other pathological processes to consider include neurofibromas, palmer fibromatosis, extra-abdominal desmoid tumors, and early presentation of myositis ossificans if intramuscular.The diagnosis can be confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a probe to the USP6 17p13 locus.7USP6 rearrangements in 10% or greater lesional cells are considered positive with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 100%, respectively. Our patient showed a USP6 rearrangement in 44% of lesional cells, confirming the diagnosis.Imaging with ultrasonography may show ill-defined hypoechoic nodules in the deep or superficial fascial layers, whereas imaging with magnetic resonance imaging showed T1-isointense nodules and T2-hyperintense nodules.8 However, this utility is limited, and fine-needle biopsy or core biopsy may reveal more detailed histological findings. An initial observation period of several weeks may be warranted, especially considering the self-limiting and/or spontaneous regression course of the disease. Steroid injections have also been found to aid lesion regression. However, surgical excision still remains the mainstay treatment of choice.

According to her mother, new lesions had appeared during the past weeks on the shoulders. Physical examination revealed coarse facial features, hepatomegaly (7 cm below the costal arch), distinctive lumbar kyphosis, and muscular hypotonia compared with her twin brother. Dermoscopy showed faint clouds of nonhomogeneously distributed light brown pigment.A, Polycyclic, brown, partly livid shimmering macules covered large areas of the back, neck, buttocks, and lower extremities. B, Fusiform and dendritic cells were found scattered in the dermis (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×100). C, Immunohistological staining of the same specimen (original magnification ×200).

GM1 gangliosidosis,C,GM1 gangliosidosis,"Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy specimen revealed a slightly hyperpigmented epidermis with a moderate increase in melanocytes on S-100 protein and Melan-A staining. In the dermis, multiple S-100 protein–positive fusiform and dendritic cells were found (Figure, B and C), which were also positive on Fontana-Masson staining. Therefore, the histopathological pattern was consistent with a mongolian spot (nevus fuscoceruleus).However, the kyphosis, coarse facial features, muscular hypotonia, and hepatomegaly were consistent with a lysosomal storage disease. Further investigations revealed a cardiomyopathy (left ventricular hypertrophy and mitral insufficiency), as well as ultrasonographic abnormalities in the brain (voluminous hyperechoic basal ganglia). Fundoscopic examination demonstrated a cherry-red spot on the retina. Spot urine analysis was negative for glycosaminoglycans. A chest radiograph showed paddle-shaped ribs, as well as a triangle-shaped body of the first lumbar vertebra (Figure, D), favoring the diagnosis of a lysosomal storage disease.β-Galactosidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes was also significantly reduced, which is indicative of type I (infantile) GM1 gangliosidosis. Subsequent genetic analysis identified a homozygous mutation in exon 2 of the GLB1 gene (c.176G>A p.R59H) (OMIM 611458), confirming the diagnosis. The OMIM accession number of the phenotype (type I GM1 gangliosidosis) is 230500.Nevi fuscocerulei are benign melanocytic congenital birthmarks with a diameter of 3 to 10 cm. They localize in the lumbosacral region, usually resolve during childhood, and predominate in Asian (ie, mongolian spots), American Indian, and African populations.Widespread mongolian spots can be indicative of inborn errors of metabolism, in particular lysosomal storage diseases. Most frequently, these errors include GM1 gangliosidosis (15 cases reported)1-8 and Hurler-Scheie syndrome, followed by Niemann-Pick disease, Hunter syndrome, and α-mannosidosis.9GM1 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive disease. More than 165 mutations in the GLB1 gene (3p22.3), encoding β-galactosidase, have been described. The missense mutation p.R59H (c.176G>A) is the most common mutation found in European patients with GM1 gangliosidosis.10 Enzyme deficiency results in toxic accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in many tissues. In the most severe form (type I), symptoms become apparent by age 6 months. Patients develop hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disability, loss of vision, distinctive facial features, and gingival hypertrophy. They die within the first 2 to 3 years of life. In type II (onset, 1½ to 5 years), there is delayed motor and cognitive development. Life expectancy is shortened.In the adult form (onset, 3-30 years), patients develop dystonia and vertebral abnormalities. Life expectancy correlates with the level of β-galactosidase activity.GM1, one of the major gangliosides, is known to increase nerve growth factor (NGF) activity, mediated by the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptor. In melanocytes, NGF-activated Trk receptor promotes proliferation and is speculated to inhibit transdermal migration. Therefore, mongolian spots in GM1 gangliosidosis are thought to be caused by arrested transdermal migration of melanocytes from the neural crest into the epidermis, leading to their entrapment and proliferation in the dermis.5,6,8,9Multiple and extensive nevi fuscocerulei merit special attention. In some lysosomal storage diseases (eg, Hurler-Scheie syndrome and Hunter syndrome), early diagnosis allows treatment with recombinant enzyme therapy or stem cell transplantation.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2688027,"A 4-week-old male infant presented to the pediatric ophthalmology clinic with bilateral congenital corneal opacities. The pregnancy was full-term and uncomplicated, and he was delivered spontaneously without the use of forceps. His corneal abnormalities were noted by the neonatologists on the first day of life. A systemic survey revealed no other dysmorphic findings. He was referred to the clinic for further evaluation and management. Examination under anesthesia revealed bilateral corneal opacities with peripheral clearing and absent red reflexes. The white-to-white corneal diameters were 10 mm horizontally and vertically in both eyes, and B-scan ultrasonography revealed unremarkable posterior segments. Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the diagnosis of Peters anomaly type I with iridocorneal adhesions and no apparent lens involvement. At the same session, a large iridectomy with lysis of iridocorneal adhesions was performed in both eyes to establish a clear, noncentral optical axis.Shallowing of the anterior chamber was observed immediately after the iridectomy. However, the patient’s corneal opacity precluded an accurate assessment of the chamber depth and stability (Figure 1).A temporal iridectomy was present, but the anterior chamber depth could not be assessed accurately owing to corneal opacity.Inflate the anterior chamber with ophthalmic viscosurgical device.Tilt the microscope for better visualization of the anterior chamber.",Apply fibrin glue to all surgical wounds.,Inflate the anterior chamber with ophthalmic viscosurgical device.,Inject a sterile air bubble.,Tilt the microscope for better visualization of the anterior chamber.,Peters anomaly type I,C,Inject a sterile air bubble.,"Congenital corneal opacities may induce dense amblyopia, resulting in poor visual outcomes. In patients with an incompletely opacified cornea, a clear visual axis can sometimes be established by either optical dilation with pharmacological agents or with an optical sector iridectomy.1-3 The use of sterile air bubble as a space-occupying agent in ophthalmic surgery has largely been replaced by the use of various ophthalmic viscosurgical devices, with indications for sterile air limited to the tamponade of retinal breaks or in support of a graft during endothelial keratoplasty.4,5In this patient, the corneal opacity precluded the adequate assessment of anterior chamber depth and stability during wound closure. A sterile intracameral air bubble allows the visualization of the interface between the bubble and the lens capsule (Figure 2) and thus the assessment of the chamber depth. The shape and size of the bubble footprint make monitoring chamber stability possible: A small, round footprint suggests a deep and stable chamber, whereas a collapsing chamber results in a broadening and ovalization of the bubble footprint. The injection of intracameral sterile air bubble is an easy intraoperative maneuver to gauge chamber stability when the cornea is not sufficiently clear to allow direct assessment.With the injection of a balanced salt solution, the bubble footprint became small and round, suggesting a stable and deep anterior chamber.Applying fibrin glue (choice A) in this case is unnecessary, because there was no evidence that watertight wound closure could not be achieved with suturing. Filling the chamber with an ophthalmic viscosurgical device (choice B) will maintain its depth temporarily, although collapse is still possible during the washout, and retained ophthalmic viscosurgical device will result in intraocular pressure spikes that may damage the remaining clear cornea. Tilting the microscope (choice D) is unlikely to improve the assessment of chamber depth and stability without the use of a slit beam.Approximately 6 months after bilateral optical iridectomy, the patient had bright red reflexes in both eyes and was able to fixate and pursue small fixation targets.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2766241,"A man in his 30s was incidentally found to have an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) result. Two years prior to presentation, the patient was presumptively diagnosed with viral myocarditis at an outside hospital after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was subsequently scheduled to undergo endomyocardial biopsy but was lost to follow-up. Two weeks prior to the date of the presenting ECG, he was admitted to the hospital for symptomatic bradycardia and found to be in sinus rhythm with complete atrioventricular block. A dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted, with active fixation leads placed in the right atrium and right ventricular apex. An ECG obtained immediately after the procedure showed an atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm. The postimplantation course was uncomplicated, and he was subsequently discharged. He presented for routine postprocedure outpatient follow-up, at which time this ECG (Figure 1) was obtained. His vital signs were documented as a blood pressure of 119/69 mm Hg, a heart rate of 51 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. He was asymptomatic.",Place a transvenous pacing device,Begin transcutaneous pacing,Obtain chest radiographs,Place a magnet on the pulse generator,"Atrial lead dislodgment and migration, resulting in ventricular capture",C,Obtain chest radiographs,"The atrial and ventricular rates were approximately 75 and 50 beats per minute, respectively. Atrioventricular dissociation was present, indicating complete heart block. Two pacing stimuli were seen bracketing each QRS complex. These are indicated by the ECG machine with inverted triangles along the top of Figure 2. The QRS morphology was typical of left bundle branch block, consistent with right ventricular pacing. The first stimulus did not precede visible P waves, indicating atrial noncapture; however, this stimulus did result in ventricular depolarization (capture). The second pacing stimulus did not result in either atrial or ventricular capture, which is likely explained by delivery of the pacing stimulus during the ventricular myocardial refractory period. Based on this pattern and the duration between the stimuli (about 180 milliseconds), atrial lead dislodgment with ventricular capture by the atrial lead was the leading differential diagnosis. Lead reversal at the pulse generator could not be excluded using only the surface ECG but was implausible in this case because the postimplantation ECG showed a normal atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm. Additionally, if this patient experienced lead reversal, it would be expected for P waves to be seen following the second pacing stimulus. It is also possible that a second pacing stimulus would not be delivered if the ventricular lead were to sense the atrial stimulus (ie, crosstalk) or, in the case of intact ventriculoatrial conduction, a retrograde P wave.A, Representative leads from presenting electrocardiogram annotated to highlight pacemaker stimuli. B and C, Posteroanterior (B) and lateral (C) chest radiographs demonstrating right atrial lead dislodgment. The right atrial lead has migrated to the right ventricular apex (yellow arrowheads), while the right ventricular lead appears to be affixed to the right ventricular septum (black arrowheads).Chest radiographs (choice C) are the most expeditious means by which to evaluate suspected lead migration. Posteroanterior and lateral films were obtained (Figure 2), confirming right atrial lead dislodgment with migration to the right ventricular apex. The patient was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic, and thus neither transcutaneous pacing (choice B) nor transvenous pacing (choice A) were indicated.1 Medical therapy for bradycardia (eg, atropine) would also not be indicated in absence of symptoms or hemodynamic derangement.1 Placement of a magnet (choice D) would result in asynchronous pacing at the magnet rate.2 This would not be unreasonable, but in this case, this would result in the same pacemaker-stimulus-bracketed QRS pattern but at a higher rate.In this case, the chest radiograph was essential. It would be possible, albeit more challenging, to use the pacemaker itself to differentiate between lead reversal at the pulse generator and lead migration. One strategy would be to reprogram the device to the ventricular demand pacing (VVI) mode of function, which would eliminate atrial pacing output. The first pacing stimulus would then not occur, and stimuli delivered at the right ventricular lead would continue to result in ventricular depolarization. If the atrial demand–inhibited (AAI) mode of function were programmed, the second pacing stimulus would not be delivered and the dislodged atrial stimuli would result in continued ventricular depolarization. With lead reversal, in contrast, programming VVI mode would result in atrial depolarization by stimuli delivered from the ventricular lead, while AAI mode would result in ventricular depolarization by stimuli delivered through the atrial lead. Since VVI pacing would result in only atrial depolarization, it is important to remember that this maneuver could produce ventricular asystole in the setting of absence of atrioventricular conduction.The patient underwent right atrial lead repositioning under fluoroscopic guidance. An ECG obtained after the procedure revealed atrial-ventricular dual-paced rhythm with occasional atrial inhibition by native complexes at a rate of 61 beats per minute, indicating appropriate positions of the atrial and ventricular leads.",JAMA Cardiology Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,male,368,original,"<answer>

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2648267,"A 51-year-old woman presented to our institution’s emergency department with an ocular surface lesion in the left eye. She had an 11-mm pigmented conjunctival lesion that was suspicious for melanoma with significant involvement of the caruncle, bulbar conjunctiva, and palpebral conjunctiva. The patient subsequently underwent a complete excision of the tumor and supplemental cryotherapy to the resection bed. Pathological results confirmed the diagnosis of conjunctival melanoma. The tumor had invaded the medial canthus and medial rectus insertion; however, no scleral invasion was observed during the intraoperative examination. Three months later, she had a new pigment deposition adjacent to the limbus in the area of the prior resection, for which she underwent additional excision and cryotherapy. Pathology specimens from this excision were negative for atypia. The patient was given mitomycin C as adjuvant therapy.Two months later, the patient presented for follow-up. Her visual acuity and intraocular pressure were at baseline and within normal limits, respectively. On slitlamp examination, a peaked pupil was noted (Figure 1). No new pigment was noted on the ocular surface. She also stated that she had pain to the eye.A, Slitlamp photography of the left eye demonstrating the pupil peaked toward the 9:30 area.",Continue administering mitomycin C and schedule a follow-up visit in 6 to 8 weeks,Obtain an ultrasonographic biomicroscopy,Biopsy the limbal area around 9:30,Delay mitomycin C therapy for a few weeks,Peripheral anterior synechiae secondary to cryotherapy.,B,Obtain an ultrasonographic biomicroscopy,"Conjunctival melanoma has a 10-year mortality rate of approximately 15% to 25%.1 Treatment usually consists of a complete excisional biopsy with adjuvant cryotherapy. Patients often undergo topical chemotherapy after surgical intervention with mitomycin C.Given this patient’s history of an extensive conjunctival melanoma requiring a large dissection and excision, it was necessary to evaluate the new peaked pupil with ultrasonographic biomicroscopy (UBM). Continuing or delaying mitomycin C therapy would not assess the etiology of the peaked pupil. A biopsy of the area would represent an overly aggressive intervention, having not completed the diagnostic UBM testing first.Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy would evaluate the ciliary body to exclude the possibility of intraocular extension, with the tumor potentially pushing forward and inducing focal peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS). The incidence of conjunctival melanoma with intraocular extension is extremely rare, but has been reported by multiple groups. One report2 describes an association between intraocular extension of conjunctival melanoma and a limbal location, with intraocular invasion likely because of breach of the Bowman membrane. Another report1 describes a patient who had a large recurrent conjunctival melanoma after undergoing multiple excisions who also had a history of penetrating keratoplasty; the melanoma had invaded the ciliary body, trabecular meshwork, and iris. Another case3 described intraocular extension several years after trabeculectomy surgery. One similarity shared among these cases was the need for multiple surgical procedures for a complete tumor excision, as well as a history of penetrating intraocular surgery, suggesting an iatrogenic role for intraocular spread. Notably, the inverse clinical presentation has been previously reported as well in a rare case of primary uveal melanoma metastasizing to the conjunctiva.4 In this case, no intraocular surgery had been completed before or after the melanoma resection.Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy results of the suspicious area showed no ciliary body tumor extension, but rather a focal PAS formation (Figure 2). The PAS noted on gonioscopy that caused the peaked pupil was attributed to inflammatory cicatricial changes from multiple applications of cryotherapy to the limbus. This finding has been observed among several patients with ocular surface squamous neoplasia and melanoma who were treated with cryotherapy. We have also observed microhyphemas on the first postoperative day in rare occasions. The patient continued to undergo topical mitomycin C therapy and was monitored without evidence of local recurrence. Unfortunately, a systemic workup has suggested a potential axillary lymph node metastasis, for which she is being followed up by an oncology service.Ultrasound biomicroscopy (longitudinal probe orientation at 9:30) demonstrating a focal area of peripheral anterior synechiae.

A fine-needle biopsy of an enlarged left-sided cervical lymph node yielded benign results. One month later, he presented to a local emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain. Symptoms began 6 weeks earlier and had been intermittent in nature. He had also experienced fatigue, night sweats, decreased appetite, and weight loss for 6 weeks. He otherwise denied having fevers, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or easy bruising. Physical examination revealed bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy in addition to mild diffuse abdominal pain. Laboratory results revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), a white blood cell count of 6.4 × 103/μL, and a platelet count of 404 × 103/μL  (to convert to × 109/L, multiply by 1) in addition to negative results for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C assays. Additional workup results were notable for elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 10 (1091 pg/mL), IL-6 (3.1 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (4.9 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (79 mm/h). A computed tomography scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis further revealed extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, with extensive inflammation and fat stranding adjacent to these enlarged nodes.

The patient then underwent excisional biopsy of an enlarged right cervical lymph node (Figure).A, Proliferation of slitlike blood vessels (hematoxylin-eosin).

Multicentric Castleman disease,B,Multicentric Castleman disease,"A microscopic analysis of the biopsy revealed focal concentric mantle cell zone architecture (or onion-skin morphology; Figure). Further, the capsule was noted to be focally thickened, with the presence of vascular proliferation in addition to substantial intermedullary plasmacytosis. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated human herpes virus–8 (HHV8) positivity in the spindle cells in areas of vascular proliferation (diagnostic of Kaposi sarcoma; Figure) and the round large lymphoid cells in the follicles (diagnostic of coexisting multicentric Castleman disease [MCD]).1 A peripheral blood sample also demonstrated HHV8 positivity, and a diagnosis of MCD was made. There were no granulomas or necrosis seen, making granulomatous diseases, including tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, unlikely. Moreover, the preserved nodal architecture was not consistent with lymphoma.Castleman disease (CD) was first described in the mid-1950s and is currently regarded as a group of at least 4 disorders with a wide range of presentations and overlapping histopathologic patterns.2 Multicentric CD represents a subcategory of CD that involves lymphadenopathy across multiple lymph node stations in which a morphological triad has been described that comprises (1) diffuse marked plasmacytosis, (2) prominent germinal centers that often have hyaline vascular changes, and (3) preserved nodal architecture.3 In particular, HHV8-associated MCD (HHV8-MCD) comprises most MCD cases.1 Its pathogenesis is associated with uncontrolled HHV8 infection and thought to involve viral infection of B cells and plasmablasts with dysregulation of cytokines and a resultant increase in IL-6 that then is followed by the symptoms, signs, and lymph node pathology associated with this condition.4 Human herpes virus 8 MCD is most commonly seen in HIV-positive patients, although HHV8-MCD has also been reported in HIV-negative patients.3 Human herpes virus 8 MCD tends to present during the seventh decade of life in HIV-negative patients (as opposed to the fifth decade in HIV-positive patients), and includes systemic signs and symptoms, including fevers, night sweats, fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly, and liver and kidney dysfunction.2 Diagnosis is established by testing for HHV8 in the biopsied lymph node tissue or circulation in a patient with multicentric lymphadenopathy with the previously noted CD histopathological features.2 Notably, HHV8-MCD not only confers an elevated risk of Kaposi sarcoma (in up to 50% of cases) but also large B-cell and primary effusion lymphomas (about 15%).1Unlike unicentric CD, which involves lymphadenopathy in a single nodal station and for which complete surgical excision is usually curative, MCD has a poorer prognosis and requires systemic treatment.1 The mainstay of systemic therapy for HHV8-MCD involves rituximab-based (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) approaches, which have improved overall survival for this patient population from 33% to 90%, with many achieving clinical remission.2 Although most of the case series have examined HHV8-MCD in HIV-positive patients,5 rituximab-based therapies with or without treatment with etoposide have also demonstrated success in HIV-negative patients.2,6,7 While to our knowledge there are currently no consensus guidelines on HHV8-MCD treatment in HIV-negative patients, many experts recommend an individualized approach and treatment based on duration of symptoms and trends in the relevant inflammatory markers.This patient ultimately received a diagnosis of HHV8-MCD and was connected with a hematology-oncology specialist for further treatment. Rituximab-based therapy was offered as a treatment option in addition to referral to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease for further assessment. This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis, including Castleman disease, in the workup of cervical lymphadenopathy in elderly patients. In particular, cervical lymphadenopathy is a common presenting problem for which referrals are commonly made to otolaryngologists for further evaluation and possible surgical excision. It also underscores the importance of prompt referral to a hematology-oncology expert given the potentially treatable nature of this disease, in addition to the elevated risk for secondary cancer.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,male,156,original,"<answer>

Her medical history was unremarkable. Her immunizations were up to date, and she had had an uncomplicated prenatal and delivery course. Her ocular history and family history were unremarkable. On examination, the patient’s visual acuity was 20/25 OU and pupillary responses and intraocular pressures were normal. The anterior segments were normal, the lenses were clear, and there was no inflammation in either eye. On a dilated fundus examination, the vitreous was clear bilaterally. A single, superonasal, white retinal mass with no visible calcification or subretinal fluid was present in the right eye (approximately 2.5 disc diameters away from the optic nerve), with associated retinal pigment epithelium changes at the edge of the lesion (Figure 1) and a normal optic disc and posterior pole. The left posterior segment was normal.Right eye fundus photograph at presentation: ultra-widefield image obtained in the clinic.

Retinoblastoma must be ruled out in any child with leukocoria or a posterior segment mass. An examination under anesthesia (choice B) is needed for a scleral depressed examination, ultrasonography (because a calcified retinal tumor is pathognomonic), and MRI with contrast to assess the eyes, optic nerves, orbits, and brain. A uveitis workup (choice A) is inappropriate because the patient had no intraocular inflammation, and this approach does not further investigate the mass. Imaging for tuberous sclerosis (choice C) is not indicated, because the lesion is more concerning for retinoblastoma than astrocytic hamartoma, which in young patients usually presents with gray-white or translucent, noncalcified retinal lesions. Clinical observation (choice D) is inappropriate for a potentially neoplastic posterior segment mass.During the examination under anesthesia, B-scan ultrasonography showed a single intraretinal lesion (basal dimensions, 5 × 12 mm; thickness, 1 mm) with trace calcification without extraocular extension. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the intraretinal tumor location (Figure 2). The MRI had results notable for a plaquelike lesion along the posterior-medial right globe without enhancement. The patient was diagnosed with unilateral group B retinoblastoma (per the International Intraocular Classification of Retinoblastoma). The tumor was successfully treated with focal laser consolidation monthly, 3 times, under anesthesia.Optical coherence tomography from the patient’s examination showing the intraretinal tumor.Germline retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB1) testing from saliva revealed a variant in exon 20 (c.1978_1996del, p.Leu660Valfs*11), resulting in a premature stop codon and disrupted protein. This variant is not included in the Genome Aggregation Database and has not been reported in RB1-associated disease. The variant was detected in 14% of the 337 sequencing reads, suggesting mosaicism, which means that the sequence variation occurred after conception and is present in only a subset of the patient’s cells.1 Subsequent lymphocyte DNA sequencing confirmed the same sequence variation in 50% of the sequencing reads, further supporting mosaicism. Recent studies demonstrated mosaicism in retinoblastoma is more common than previously recognized.2-5 Since it is unknown what proportion of retinal cells and other tissues harbor the sequence variation, the patient must be screened and her family counseled that a patient with germline RB1 sequence variation is at risk for new ocular tumors, retinoblastoma-associated malignant conditions, and potential transmission of the RB1 sequence variation to her future children.Retinoblastoma can present with unilateral, bilateral, or trilateral (tumors in both eyes and a pineal or suprasellar tumor) disease. Patients with somatic variants of both RB1 alleles in a retinal cell present with unilateral disease and do not carry a pathogenic RB1 variant in every cell (they are germline negative). Germline RB1 variants are associated with bilateral disease (although 10%-15% of patients with this pathogenic variant have unilateral disease), and patients are at risk for additional ocular tumors and trilateral retinoblastoma. Approximately 2% of retinoblastomas do not harbor RB1 alterations and instead are driven by high-level N-myc (MYCN) oncogene amplification.6The family elected laser therapy. However, we discussed the possibility that the lesion may be a retinocytoma, a rare, benign retinoblastoma variant often associated with calcification, retinal pigment epithelial disturbance, chorioretinal atrophy, and absence of growth.7,8 Retinocytomas, which result from RB1 sequence variations, carry an approximate 5% risk of malignant transformation7 and require close observation and treatment for any growth or change.8",JAMA Ophthalmology Clinical Challenge ,"The retinal mass is denoted with arrowheads.Initiate a uveitis workup for infectious and inflammatory conditionsPlan an urgent examination under anesthesia, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)Obtain chest and abdomen MRI to evaluate for cardiac rhabdomyoma and kidney cysts or tumors associated with neurocutaneous syndromes What Would You Do Next?",female,323,original,"<answer>

She was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at 35 weeks’ gestation, and 1 week later she underwent cesarean delivery. At 3 weeks’ postpartum, she began chemotherapy (cycle 1, day 1) with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). On day 15 of cycle 1, she presented with linear, hyperpigmented streaks and welts on her arms, back, and legs. Intense, diffuse pruritus had developed within 24 hours of the patient’s first day of treatment, and her symptoms were poorly responsive to antihistamines and topical steroids. Pruritus was followed by the appearance of dark scratch marks as demonstrated in the Figure. Laboratory test results revealed a white blood cell count of 1.6 ×103 cells/mm3, with an absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/mm3 and a total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104), which was unchanged from the baseline total bilirubin.Clinical photograph of the patient’s back shows scratch marks that appeared after diffuse pruritus.Prior to the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, she was receiving routine prenatal care, and the only complication was pruritus without a rash that developed during the first trimester. She was evaluated for right supraclavicular adenopathy that was unresponsive to antibiotics during the third trimester. Findings from a lymph node biopsy were consistent with classic Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis subtype. Staging imaging revealed bilateral supraclavicular jugular chain, paratracheal and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 67 mm/h. She was diagnosed with stage II, unfavorable-risk Hodgkin lymphoma.",Bleomycin toxic effects,Paraneoplastic skin disease,Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy,Vinblastine toxic effects,A. Bleomycin toxic effects,A,Bleomycin toxic effects,"This patient developed bleomycin flagellate dermatitis, a cutaneous reaction to bleomycin characterized by the appearance of pruritic, whiplike streaks of hyperpigmentation, predominantly affecting the trunk and extremities. Bleomycin is a sulfur-containing, antineoplastic agent that blocks the G2 phase of the cell cycle through inhibition of thymidine integration into replicating DNA, degradation of single- and double-stranded DNA, and cleavage of cellular RNA.1 Bleomycin distributes widely throughout the body and is inactivated in every organ except the skin and lungs owing to the absence of the hydrolase enzyme responsible for the drug’s metabolism.2 Absence of this enzyme permits drug accumulation, which can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and various adverse cutaneous manifestations associated with bleomycin.1Flagellate dermatitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis because there are no pathognomonic histologic features. Early histologic findings are consistent with a fixed-drug reaction, and in later stages, reflect a postinflammatory reaction.3 Time of onset varies, occurring within hours or up to 9 weeks following exposure, and the reported incidence of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis is between 8% and 22%.4 Symptoms are generally well controlled with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and withdrawal of bleomycin. Early descriptions of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis documented an apparent dose-dependent occurrence in 8% to 66% of patients; however, the flagellate exanthem has since been reported with bleomycin doses as low as 5 mg with no predictable patient demographic.2-4 Nonetheless, Ziemer et al4 observed in a meta-analysis that women receiving bleomycin specifically for lymphoproliferative disorders might be most susceptible to developing acute-onset flagellate dermatitis at lower doses of exposure.This patient initially discontinued bleomycin for 1 cycle, but she tolerated successful reintroduction of bleomycin with an adjuvant steroid regimen. She remained in remission more than 2 years after chemotherapy completion and had no evidence of bleomycin pulmonary toxic effects. Until recently, there have been no definitive guidelines regarding whether to withdraw bleomycin or rechallenge following an eruption of flagellate dermatitis. The Response Adapted Therapy for Advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma (RATHL) trial randomized patients with negative findings on positron-emission tomography after 2 cycles of ABVD to continue ABVD or deescalate treatment to adriamycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD).5 The absolute difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate between the 2 groups was 1.6% (95% CI, −3.2% to 5.3%) and there was a lower incidence of pulmonary toxic effects when bleomycin was omitted.5 Another important phase 3 clinical trial (ECHELON-1)6 compared brentuximab vedotin plus AVD (A+AVD) with standard ABVD in previously untreated patients with stage III or IV Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin plus AVD was superior, with a 4.9% lower combined risk of disease progression, death, or incomplete disease response at 2 years, and pulmonary toxic effects were documented in less than 1% of patients receiving A+AVD compared with 3% in those receiving ABVD.6 Although these studies do not specifically address flagellate dermatitis, the data suggest an impending transition in the standard of care favoring withdrawal of bleomycin treatment in patients with complications associated with the toxic effects of the drug, especially if they demonstrate favorable initial clinical response to treatment.Cutaneous toxic effects are a common reaction among chemotherapies in general, and bleomycin is associated with a variety of cutaneous manifestations, including inflammatory nodules, plaques, blistering, nail changes, and alopecia.3 Flagellate dermatitis, however, is considered a classic presentation for the toxic effects of bleomycin.4 Paraneoplastic skin involvement related to Hodgkin disease is well documented but typically encompasses nonspecific occurrence of severe pruritus with or without prurigo, acquired ichthyosis, alopecia or other eruptions that do not reflect tumor invasion. Rarely, cutaneous dissemination of malignant cells can cause more skin changes, which classically develop as painless papules, nodules, plaques, and ulcerations, that are histologically comparable to their affected lymph node counterparts and generally portend a poor prognosis.7,8 Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy could be considered as a differential diagnosis because it occurs in the immediate postpartum period; however, variable pruritic papules and plaques are the defining features of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy.9",JAMA Oncology Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,female,534,original,"<answer>

The patient remained asymptomatic for 10 months but had a recurrence in the same area with extension into the parotid gland without involvement of the masseter. He subsequently underwent wide local excision. Cultures returned positive for Mycobacterium abscessus.Right preauricular cutaneous lesion demonstrating the violaceous hue.The differential diagnosis of this condition should include mycobacterium TB adenitis, viral lymphadenitis, hematologic cancer, aerobic abscess, and bartonella henselae.1 While a branchial cleft cyst and chronic sialadenitis with abscess could present similarly, the skin changes and indolent course without systemic symptoms are more suggestive of an NTM. Magnetic resonance imaging showing a necrotic lesion with associated lymphadenopathy is not suggestive of a lymphovascular malformation.An NTM infection can prove to be a diagnostic challenge, especially when the characteristic skin changes are absent and cultures are negative. The typical age of presentation is 1 to 5 years old, with an incidence of 0.77 to 1.3 in 100 000 children.2-5 Hundreds of species exist, but Mycobacterium avium complex is most commonly implicated in lymphadenitis.5 These bacteria are believed to have primarily environmental (soil or water) origins.6 In children, this most commonly involves submandibular or cervical nodes and, less frequently, the preauricular, sublingual, and parotid lymph nodes.1-3,7When suspecting NTM, it is important to rule out TB adenitis because it has a considerably different treatment paradigm.5 Tuberculosis typically has more systemic symptoms, whereas NTM lymphadenitis commonly presents as local erythema and fluctuance without substantial tenderness, which can progress to violaceous skin changes with fistula formation.6 Staining methods include fluorochrome, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Kinyoun, although NTM is visualized in only 30% to 60% of cases.5 Recommendations support performing both solid and broth culture medias, and different species of bacteria require different intubation times (7 days to 12 weeks).5 Polymerase chain reaction testing, when available, tends to have the greatest sensitivity.6 Definitive diagnosis of NTM is with a positive culture, although cultures are only positive in 50% to 82% of specimens, which further adds to the diagnostic difficultly.5Treatment options include observation, antimicrobial agents, surgical procedures, or a combination of any of these.6,7 Antimicrobial therapy alone is associated with a prolonged treatment course with potential adverse effects and a higher rate of recurrence.7 A meta-analysis showed no difference for recurrence rates between antimicrobials vs observation.7 Total surgical excision has demonstrated a cure rate greater than 90% in multiple studies, and as such, current literature supports total surgical excision with or without adjuvant macrolide antimicrobials as the treatment of choice.5-8Special considerations for surgical management of parotid NTM infections include risk of injury to the facial nerve and the psychosocial effect of having a scar on the face.7 In the present case, the patient had fistula formation before surgery; thus, he was already at risk of cosmetic disfiguration from the infected wound even before operating. Of 16 published studies documenting surgical treatment of pediatric parotid NTM infections, in which 59% were total or near total excision, no cases of permanent facial weakness were reported.9 Another study showed a permanent nerve weakness in only 2% of patients undergoing surgery for head and neck NTM.7The present patient was doing well at last follow-up, with full facial function and a well-healing incision. Although NTM of the parotid is an infrequent presentation of a relatively common pediatric infection, it should remain on the differential diagnosis.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,male,198,original,"<answer>

At her routine follow - up visit 2 weeks prior , the proliferative diabetic retinopathy was quiescent , and her Snellen visual acuity was 20/20 OD with manifest refraction of −1.50   +   0.25   ×   180 . Examination of the anterior segment at that time was unremarkable . At her current visit , visual acuity with the previous correction had been reduced to 20/150 . Repeated manifest refraction of the right eye was −4.00   +   1.50   ×   166 , resulting in a visual acuity of 20/25 . Intraocular pressure of the right eye was 10 mm Hg by Goldmann applanation tonometry . Evaluation of the posterior segment , including dilated fundus examination and optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) of the macula , showed stability compared with previous results .

Anterior segment OCT confirmed the diagnosis. Performing a posterior capsulotomy would allow egress of the turbid material into the vitreous cavity and provide immediate resolution of the refractive change with minimal risk. If this was not successful, we would then perform a posterior capsulotomy during pars plana vitrectomy (choice A). Exchanging the IOL (choice C) is not preferred because decreasing the new lens power to compensate for the myopic shift would result in a hyperopic surprise, as the procedure itself would resolve the capsular bag distention syndrome (CBDS). Observation (choice D) is preferable when the patient does not want intervention; however, the myopic shift needs to be corrected with an updated manifest refraction.Capsular bag distention syndrome, also known as capsular block syndrome, is a rare complication after phacoemulsification and placement of an IOL into the capsular bag.1,2 It is characterized by the accumulation of opaque fluid within the potential space between the posterior aspect of the IOL and the intact posterior capsule. Capsular bag distention syndrome is classified as intraoperative, early-onset, or late-onset on the basis of time of onset.3 Intraoperative CBDS occurs with lens luxation following hydrodissection. Early-onset CBDS is associated with retained viscoelastic materials. Late-onset CBDS is caused by residual cortical cells secreting alpha-crystallin proteins, which creates a turbid milieu that slowly accumulates and distends the posterior capsule.4 Patients with diabetes are not at increased risk for this syndrome. Although intraoperative and early-onset forms of CBDS are often associated with high intraocular pressure and shallowing of the anterior chamber, these features may be absent in the late-onset form.5 This patient presented with late-onset CBDS, demonstrating symptomatic visual acuity decline approximately 4 years after cataract surgery.Although CBDS can be diagnosed clinically, the value of using anterior segment OCT has been previously reported.6 The combination of increased refractive index of the turbid milieu along with convex configuration of the hyperdistended capsular bag forms a plus lens effect that causes a myopic shift, as experienced by this patient.Capsular bag distention syndrome can often be treated with Nd:YAG laser–assisted posterior capsulotomy, as this quick in-office procedure evacuates the turbid milieu from the capsular bag and resolves symptoms almost immediately.5,7 When an infectious etiology, in particular Propionibacterium acnes, is suspected, use of pars plana vitrectomy is necessary to surgically remove the contents of the bag, along with possible IOL exchange and/or injection of intraocular antibiotics.8,9 In this patient, there were no clinical findings of intraocular inflammation or capsular plaques to suggest infection.This patient underwent uneventful Nd:YAG laser–assisted posterior capsulotomy of the right eye; 1 hour after the procedure, the intraocular pressure was 11 mm Hg by applanation. Within 10 minutes after the procedure, the patient reported noticeably improved distance vision in the right eye. Repeated manifest refraction showed resolution of the myopic shift.

Nodular fasciitis,D,Nodular fasciitis,"First described in 1955 by Konwaler et al,1 nodular fasciitis is a rapidly growing benign soft-tissue mass characterized by abundant cellularity, rapid growth, and high mitotic activity. Located in either the deep subcutaneous tissues or superficial fascia, nodular fasciitis is a nonneoplastic proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Although the pathological and clinical presentation resembles that of malignant soft-tissue sarcomas, often leading to misdiagnosis, the condition is benign. The etiology of nodular fasciitis is uncertain, with some proposing that it is a reactive process associated with trauma, while others describe it as a self-limiting clonal process with neoplastic origins.2 Originally called pseudosarcomatous fibromatosis, other terms, such as nodular pseudosarcomatous fasciitis, pseudosarcomatous fasciitis, infiltrative fasciitis, or proliferative fasciitis may be used to refer to the same disease process.Nodular fasciitis preferentially affects adults (in 80% of cases), usually within the first 2 to 4 decades of life with a slight male predominance.3 Although rare in children, it can present as a chest wall tumor in children (it constitutes 1.8% of all childhood solid chest wall tumors),4 and should considered as a diagnosis. After surgical excision, local recurrence has been documented but is rare.5Most lesions are subcutaneous and circumscribed, lending them amenable to biopsy or excision. Patients notice a rapidly growing, subcutaneous painless mass over the course of 3 to 6 weeks. Masses are solid, nodular, firm, or rubbery and usually plateau at 2.0 to 3.0 cm, rarely exceeding 4.0 cm. The upper extremities are the most common area of presentation, especially the flexor aspect of the forearm. They are less frequently found on the trunk (20%), head and neck (20%), and lower extremities (13%),3 and may have an associated history of trauma.6 In the head and neck region, lesions are often found on the neck or face and less rarely on the forehead and/or scalp or around the eyes.3Histologically, nodular fasciitis demonstrates nonneoplastic proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, although there is a vast array of presentation pattern. The cellular composition of the mass can further divide nodular fasciitis into 3 subtypes: type 1 (myxoid), type 2 (cellular), and type 3 (fibrotic).6 The subtype of nodular fasciitis diagnosed may be dependent on the duration the lesion has been present, because fibrotic type may represent the most mature and longest-lasting lesions.6Type 1 has fibroblast-like cells within a stroma rich in collagen and/or myxoid ground substance. This type tends to form a large tumor, occurs more frequently in older patients, and appears similar to the myxoid variant of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Type 2 has significantly less ground substance and stroma, with large, plump, fibroblast-like spindle cells that have vesicular nuclei. The high cellular proliferation and mitotic activity most closely resembles sarcomatous lesions. Type 3 most closely resembles other benign lesions and has more spindle-shaped, slender fibroblast-like cells and increased collagen production.6The tumor’s rapid presentation and histological profile closely resembles that of sarcomas, often leading to misdiagnosis. Beyond sarcomas, other pathological processes to consider include neurofibromas, palmer fibromatosis, extra-abdominal desmoid tumors, and early presentation of myositis ossificans if intramuscular.The diagnosis can be confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a probe to the USP6 17p13 locus.7USP6 rearrangements in 10% or greater lesional cells are considered positive with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 100%, respectively. Our patient showed a USP6 rearrangement in 44% of lesional cells, confirming the diagnosis.Imaging with ultrasonography may show ill-defined hypoechoic nodules in the deep or superficial fascial layers, whereas imaging with magnetic resonance imaging showed T1-isointense nodules and T2-hyperintense nodules.8 However, this utility is limited, and fine-needle biopsy or core biopsy may reveal more detailed histological findings. An initial observation period of several weeks may be warranted, especially considering the self-limiting and/or spontaneous regression course of the disease. Steroid injections have also been found to aid lesion regression. However, surgical excision still remains the mainstay treatment of choice.

GM1 gangliosidosis,C,GM1 gangliosidosis,"Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy specimen revealed a slightly hyperpigmented epidermis with a moderate increase in melanocytes on S-100 protein and Melan-A staining. In the dermis, multiple S-100 protein–positive fusiform and dendritic cells were found (Figure, B and C), which were also positive on Fontana-Masson staining. Therefore, the histopathological pattern was consistent with a mongolian spot (nevus fuscoceruleus).However, the kyphosis, coarse facial features, muscular hypotonia, and hepatomegaly were consistent with a lysosomal storage disease. Further investigations revealed a cardiomyopathy (left ventricular hypertrophy and mitral insufficiency), as well as ultrasonographic abnormalities in the brain (voluminous hyperechoic basal ganglia). Fundoscopic examination demonstrated a cherry-red spot on the retina. Spot urine analysis was negative for glycosaminoglycans. A chest radiograph showed paddle-shaped ribs, as well as a triangle-shaped body of the first lumbar vertebra (Figure, D), favoring the diagnosis of a lysosomal storage disease.β-Galactosidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes was also significantly reduced, which is indicative of type I (infantile) GM1 gangliosidosis. Subsequent genetic analysis identified a homozygous mutation in exon 2 of the GLB1 gene (c.176G>A p.R59H) (OMIM 611458), confirming the diagnosis. The OMIM accession number of the phenotype (type I GM1 gangliosidosis) is 230500.Nevi fuscocerulei are benign melanocytic congenital birthmarks with a diameter of 3 to 10 cm. They localize in the lumbosacral region, usually resolve during childhood, and predominate in Asian (ie, mongolian spots), American Indian, and African populations.Widespread mongolian spots can be indicative of inborn errors of metabolism, in particular lysosomal storage diseases. Most frequently, these errors include GM1 gangliosidosis (15 cases reported)1-8 and Hurler-Scheie syndrome, followed by Niemann-Pick disease, Hunter syndrome, and α-mannosidosis.9GM1 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive disease. More than 165 mutations in the GLB1 gene (3p22.3), encoding β-galactosidase, have been described. The missense mutation p.R59H (c.176G>A) is the most common mutation found in European patients with GM1 gangliosidosis.10 Enzyme deficiency results in toxic accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in many tissues. In the most severe form (type I), symptoms become apparent by age 6 months. Patients develop hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disability, loss of vision, distinctive facial features, and gingival hypertrophy. They die within the first 2 to 3 years of life. In type II (onset, 1½ to 5 years), there is delayed motor and cognitive development. Life expectancy is shortened.In the adult form (onset, 3-30 years), patients develop dystonia and vertebral abnormalities. Life expectancy correlates with the level of β-galactosidase activity.GM1, one of the major gangliosides, is known to increase nerve growth factor (NGF) activity, mediated by the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptor. In melanocytes, NGF-activated Trk receptor promotes proliferation and is speculated to inhibit transdermal migration. Therefore, mongolian spots in GM1 gangliosidosis are thought to be caused by arrested transdermal migration of melanocytes from the neural crest into the epidermis, leading to their entrapment and proliferation in the dermis.5,6,8,9Multiple and extensive nevi fuscocerulei merit special attention. In some lysosomal storage diseases (eg, Hurler-Scheie syndrome and Hunter syndrome), early diagnosis allows treatment with recombinant enzyme therapy or stem cell transplantation.

In patients with an incompletely opacified cornea, a clear visual axis can sometimes be established by either optical dilation with pharmacological agents or with an optical sector iridectomy.1-3 The use of sterile air bubble as a space-occupying agent in ophthalmic surgery has largely been replaced by the use of various ophthalmic viscosurgical devices, with indications for sterile air limited to the tamponade of retinal breaks or in support of a graft during endothelial keratoplasty.4,5In this patient, the corneal opacity precluded the adequate assessment of anterior chamber depth and stability during wound closure. A sterile intracameral air bubble allows the visualization of the interface between the bubble and the lens capsule (Figure 2) and thus the assessment of the chamber depth. The shape and size of the bubble footprint make monitoring chamber stability possible: A small, round footprint suggests a deep and stable chamber, whereas a collapsing chamber results in a broadening and ovalization of the bubble footprint. The injection of intracameral sterile air bubble is an easy intraoperative maneuver to gauge chamber stability when the cornea is not sufficiently clear to allow direct assessment.With the injection of a balanced salt solution, the bubble footprint became small and round, suggesting a stable and deep anterior chamber.Applying fibrin glue (choice A) in this case is unnecessary, because there was no evidence that watertight wound closure could not be achieved with suturing. Filling the chamber with an ophthalmic viscosurgical device (choice B) will maintain its depth temporarily, although collapse is still possible during the washout, and retained ophthalmic viscosurgical device will result in intraocular pressure spikes that may damage the remaining clear cornea. Tilting the microscope (choice D) is unlikely to improve the assessment of chamber depth and stability without the use of a slit beam.Approximately 6 months after bilateral optical iridectomy, the patient had bright red reflexes in both eyes and was able to fixate and pursue small fixation targets.

Atrioventricular dissociation was present, indicating complete heart block. Two pacing stimuli were seen bracketing each QRS complex. These are indicated by the ECG machine with inverted triangles along the top of Figure 2. The QRS morphology was typical of left bundle branch block, consistent with right ventricular pacing. The first stimulus did not precede visible P waves, indicating atrial noncapture; however, this stimulus did result in ventricular depolarization (capture). The second pacing stimulus did not result in either atrial or ventricular capture, which is likely explained by delivery of the pacing stimulus during the ventricular myocardial refractory period. Based on this pattern and the duration between the stimuli (about 180 milliseconds), atrial lead dislodgment with ventricular capture by the atrial lead was the leading differential diagnosis. Lead reversal at the pulse generator could not be excluded using only the surface ECG but was implausible in this case because the postimplantation ECG showed a normal atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm. Additionally, if this patient experienced lead reversal, it would be expected for P waves to be seen following the second pacing stimulus. It is also possible that a second pacing stimulus would not be delivered if the ventricular lead were to sense the atrial stimulus (ie, crosstalk) or, in the case of intact ventriculoatrial conduction, a retrograde P wave.A, Representative leads from presenting electrocardiogram annotated to highlight pacemaker stimuli. B and C, Posteroanterior (B) and lateral (C) chest radiographs demonstrating right atrial lead dislodgment. The right atrial lead has migrated to the right ventricular apex (yellow arrowheads), while the right ventricular lead appears to be affixed to the right ventricular septum (black arrowheads).Chest radiographs (choice C) are the most expeditious means by which to evaluate suspected lead migration. Posteroanterior and lateral films were obtained (Figure 2), confirming right atrial lead dislodgment with migration to the right ventricular apex. The patient was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic, and thus neither transcutaneous pacing (choice B) nor transvenous pacing (choice A) were indicated.1 Medical therapy for bradycardia (eg, atropine) would also not be indicated in absence of symptoms or hemodynamic derangement.1 Placement of a magnet (choice D) would result in asynchronous pacing at the magnet rate.2 This would not be unreasonable, but in this case, this would result in the same pacemaker-stimulus-bracketed QRS pattern but at a higher rate.In this case, the chest radiograph was essential. It would be possible, albeit more challenging, to use the pacemaker itself to differentiate between lead reversal at the pulse generator and lead migration. One strategy would be to reprogram the device to the ventricular demand pacing (VVI) mode of function, which would eliminate atrial pacing output. The first pacing stimulus would then not occur, and stimuli delivered at the right ventricular lead would continue to result in ventricular depolarization. If the atrial demand–inhibited (AAI) mode of function were programmed, the second pacing stimulus would not be delivered and the dislodged atrial stimuli would result in continued ventricular depolarization. With lead reversal, in contrast, programming VVI mode would result in atrial depolarization by stimuli delivered from the ventricular lead, while AAI mode would result in ventricular depolarization by stimuli delivered through the atrial lead. Since VVI pacing would result in only atrial depolarization, it is important to remember that this maneuver could produce ventricular asystole in the setting of absence of atrioventricular conduction.The patient underwent right atrial lead repositioning under fluoroscopic guidance. An ECG obtained after the procedure revealed atrial-ventricular dual-paced rhythm with occasional atrial inhibition by native complexes at a rate of 61 beats per minute, indicating appropriate positions of the atrial and ventricular leads.",JAMA Cardiology Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,female,368,augmented_binary,"<answer>

Patients often undergo topical chemotherapy after surgical intervention with mitomycin C.Given this patient’s history of an extensive conjunctival melanoma requiring a large dissection and excision, it was necessary to evaluate the new peaked pupil with ultrasonographic biomicroscopy (UBM). Continuing or delaying mitomycin C therapy would not assess the etiology of the peaked pupil. A biopsy of the area would represent an overly aggressive intervention, having not completed the diagnostic UBM testing first.Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy would evaluate the ciliary body to exclude the possibility of intraocular extension, with the tumor potentially pushing forward and inducing focal peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS). The incidence of conjunctival melanoma with intraocular extension is extremely rare, but has been reported by multiple groups. One report2 describes an association between intraocular extension of conjunctival melanoma and a limbal location, with intraocular invasion likely because of breach of the Bowman membrane. Another report1 describes a patient who had a large recurrent conjunctival melanoma after undergoing multiple excisions who also had a history of penetrating keratoplasty; the melanoma had invaded the ciliary body, trabecular meshwork, and iris. Another case3 described intraocular extension several years after trabeculectomy surgery. One similarity shared among these cases was the need for multiple surgical procedures for a complete tumor excision, as well as a history of penetrating intraocular surgery, suggesting an iatrogenic role for intraocular spread. Notably, the inverse clinical presentation has been previously reported as well in a rare case of primary uveal melanoma metastasizing to the conjunctiva.4 In this case, no intraocular surgery had been completed before or after the melanoma resection.Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy results of the suspicious area showed no ciliary body tumor extension, but rather a focal PAS formation (Figure 2). The PAS noted on gonioscopy that caused the peaked pupil was attributed to inflammatory cicatricial changes from multiple applications of cryotherapy to the limbus. This finding has been observed among several patients with ocular surface squamous neoplasia and melanoma who were treated with cryotherapy. We have also observed microhyphemas on the first postoperative day in rare occasions. The patient continued to undergo topical mitomycin C therapy and was monitored without evidence of local recurrence.

Multicentric Castleman disease,B,Multicentric Castleman disease,"A microscopic analysis of the biopsy revealed focal concentric mantle cell zone architecture (or onion-skin morphology; Figure). Further, the capsule was noted to be focally thickened, with the presence of vascular proliferation in addition to substantial intermedullary plasmacytosis. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated human herpes virus–8 (HHV8) positivity in the spindle cells in areas of vascular proliferation (diagnostic of Kaposi sarcoma; Figure) and the round large lymphoid cells in the follicles (diagnostic of coexisting multicentric Castleman disease [MCD]).1 A peripheral blood sample also demonstrated HHV8 positivity, and a diagnosis of MCD was made. There were no granulomas or necrosis seen, making granulomatous diseases, including tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, unlikely. Moreover, the preserved nodal architecture was not consistent with lymphoma.Castleman disease (CD) was first described in the mid-1950s and is currently regarded as a group of at least 4 disorders with a wide range of presentations and overlapping histopathologic patterns.2 Multicentric CD represents a subcategory of CD that involves lymphadenopathy across multiple lymph node stations in which a morphological triad has been described that comprises (1) diffuse marked plasmacytosis, (2) prominent germinal centers that often have hyaline vascular changes, and (3) preserved nodal architecture.3 In particular, HHV8-associated MCD (HHV8-MCD) comprises most MCD cases.1 Its pathogenesis is associated with uncontrolled HHV8 infection and thought to involve viral infection of B cells and plasmablasts with dysregulation of cytokines and a resultant increase in IL-6 that then is followed by the symptoms, signs, and lymph node pathology associated with this condition.4 Human herpes virus 8 MCD is most commonly seen in HIV-positive patients, although HHV8-MCD has also been reported in HIV-negative patients.3 Human herpes virus 8 MCD tends to present during the seventh decade of life in HIV-negative patients (as opposed to the fifth decade in HIV-positive patients), and includes systemic signs and symptoms, including fevers, night sweats, fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly, and liver and kidney dysfunction.2 Diagnosis is established by testing for HHV8 in the biopsied lymph node tissue or circulation in a patient with multicentric lymphadenopathy with the previously noted CD histopathological features.2 Notably, HHV8-MCD not only confers an elevated risk of Kaposi sarcoma (in up to 50% of cases) but also large B-cell and primary effusion lymphomas (about 15%).1Unlike unicentric CD, which involves lymphadenopathy in a single nodal station and for which complete surgical excision is usually curative, MCD has a poorer prognosis and requires systemic treatment.1 The mainstay of systemic therapy for HHV8-MCD involves rituximab-based (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) approaches, which have improved overall survival for this patient population from 33% to 90%, with many achieving clinical remission.2 Although most of the case series have examined HHV8-MCD in HIV-positive patients,5 rituximab-based therapies with or without treatment with etoposide have also demonstrated success in HIV-negative patients.2,6,7 While to our knowledge there are currently no consensus guidelines on HHV8-MCD treatment in HIV-negative patients, many experts recommend an individualized approach and treatment based on duration of symptoms and trends in the relevant inflammatory markers.This patient ultimately received a diagnosis of HHV8-MCD and was connected with a hematology-oncology specialist for further treatment. Rituximab-based therapy was offered as a treatment option in addition to referral to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease for further assessment. This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis, including Castleman disease, in the workup of cervical lymphadenopathy in elderly patients. In particular, cervical lymphadenopathy is a common presenting problem for which referrals are commonly made to otolaryngologists for further evaluation and possible surgical excision. It also underscores the importance of prompt referral to a hematology-oncology expert given the potentially treatable nature of this disease, in addition to the elevated risk for secondary cancer.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,female,156,augmented_binary,"<answer>

Retinoblastoma must be ruled out in any child with leukocoria or a posterior segment mass. An examination under anesthesia (choice B) is needed for a scleral depressed examination, ultrasonography (because a calcified retinal tumor is pathognomonic), and MRI with contrast to assess the eyes, optic nerves, orbits, and brain. A uveitis workup (choice A) is inappropriate because the patient had no intraocular inflammation, and this approach does not further investigate the mass. Imaging for tuberous sclerosis (choice C) is not indicated, because the lesion is more concerning for retinoblastoma than astrocytic hamartoma, which in young patients usually presents with gray-white or translucent, noncalcified retinal lesions. Clinical observation (choice D) is inappropriate for a potentially neoplastic posterior segment mass.During the examination under anesthesia, B-scan ultrasonography showed a single intraretinal lesion (basal dimensions, 5 × 12 mm; thickness, 1 mm) with trace calcification without extraocular extension. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the intraretinal tumor location (Figure 2). The MRI had results notable for a plaquelike lesion along the posterior-medial right globe without enhancement. The patient was diagnosed with unilateral group B retinoblastoma (per the International Intraocular Classification of Retinoblastoma). The tumor was successfully treated with focal laser consolidation monthly, 3 times, under anesthesia.Optical coherence tomography from the patient’s examination showing the intraretinal tumor.Germline retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB1) testing from saliva revealed a variant in exon 20 (c.1978_1996del, p.Leu660Valfs*11), resulting in a premature stop codon and disrupted protein. This variant is not included in the Genome Aggregation Database and has not been reported in RB1-associated disease. The variant was detected in 14% of the 337 sequencing reads, suggesting mosaicism, which means that the sequence variation occurred after conception and is present in only a subset of the patient’s cells.1 Subsequent lymphocyte DNA sequencing confirmed the same sequence variation in 50% of the sequencing reads, further supporting mosaicism. Recent studies demonstrated mosaicism in retinoblastoma is more common than previously recognized.2-5 Since it is unknown what proportion of retinal cells and other tissues harbor the sequence variation, the patient must be screened and her family counseled that a patient with germline RB1 sequence variation is at risk for new ocular tumors, retinoblastoma-associated malignant conditions, and potential transmission of the RB1 sequence variation to her future children.Retinoblastoma can present with unilateral, bilateral, or trilateral (tumors in both eyes and a pineal or suprasellar tumor) disease. Patients with somatic variants of both RB1 alleles in a retinal cell present with unilateral disease and do not carry a pathogenic RB1 variant in every cell (they are germline negative). Germline RB1 variants are associated with bilateral disease (although 10%-15% of patients with this pathogenic variant have unilateral disease), and patients are at risk for additional ocular tumors and trilateral retinoblastoma. Approximately 2% of retinoblastomas do not harbor RB1 alterations and instead are driven by high-level N-myc (MYCN) oncogene amplification.6The family elected laser therapy. However, we discussed the possibility that the lesion may be a retinocytoma, a rare, benign retinoblastoma variant often associated with calcification, retinal pigment epithelial disturbance, chorioretinal atrophy, and absence of growth.7,8 Retinocytomas, which result from RB1 sequence variations, carry an approximate 5% risk of malignant transformation7 and require close observation and treatment for any growth or change.8",JAMA Ophthalmology Clinical Challenge ,"The retinal mass is denoted with arrowheads.Initiate a uveitis workup for infectious and inflammatory conditionsPlan an urgent examination under anesthesia, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)Obtain chest and abdomen MRI to evaluate for cardiac rhabdomyoma and kidney cysts or tumors associated with neurocutaneous syndromes What Would You Do Next?",male,323,augmented_binary,"<answer>

Bleomycin toxic effects,A,Bleomycin toxic effects,"This patient developed bleomycin flagellate dermatitis, a cutaneous reaction to bleomycin characterized by the appearance of pruritic, whiplike streaks of hyperpigmentation, predominantly affecting the trunk and extremities. Bleomycin is a sulfur-containing, antineoplastic agent that blocks the G2 phase of the cell cycle through inhibition of thymidine integration into replicating DNA, degradation of single- and double-stranded DNA, and cleavage of cellular RNA.1 Bleomycin distributes widely throughout the body and is inactivated in every organ except the skin and lungs owing to the absence of the hydrolase enzyme responsible for the drug’s metabolism.2 Absence of this enzyme permits drug accumulation, which can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and various adverse cutaneous manifestations associated with bleomycin.1Flagellate dermatitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis because there are no pathognomonic histologic features. Early histologic findings are consistent with a fixed-drug reaction, and in later stages, reflect a postinflammatory reaction.3 Time of onset varies, occurring within hours or up to 9 weeks following exposure, and the reported incidence of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis is between 8% and 22%.4 Symptoms are generally well controlled with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and withdrawal of bleomycin. Early descriptions of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis documented an apparent dose-dependent occurrence in 8% to 66% of patients; however, the flagellate exanthem has since been reported with bleomycin doses as low as 5 mg with no predictable patient demographic.2-4 Nonetheless, Ziemer et al4 observed in a meta-analysis that women receiving bleomycin specifically for lymphoproliferative disorders might be most susceptible to developing acute-onset flagellate dermatitis at lower doses of exposure.This patient initially discontinued bleomycin for 1 cycle, but she tolerated successful reintroduction of bleomycin with an adjuvant steroid regimen. She remained in remission more than 2 years after chemotherapy completion and had no evidence of bleomycin pulmonary toxic effects. Until recently, there have been no definitive guidelines regarding whether to withdraw bleomycin or rechallenge following an eruption of flagellate dermatitis. The Response Adapted Therapy for Advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma (RATHL) trial randomized patients with negative findings on positron-emission tomography after 2 cycles of ABVD to continue ABVD or deescalate treatment to adriamycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD).5 The absolute difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate between the 2 groups was 1.6% (95% CI, −3.2% to 5.3%) and there was a lower incidence of pulmonary toxic effects when bleomycin was omitted.5 Another important phase 3 clinical trial (ECHELON-1)6 compared brentuximab vedotin plus AVD (A+AVD) with standard ABVD in previously untreated patients with stage III or IV Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin plus AVD was superior, with a 4.9% lower combined risk of disease progression, death, or incomplete disease response at 2 years, and pulmonary toxic effects were documented in less than 1% of patients receiving A+AVD compared with 3% in those receiving ABVD.6 Although these studies do not specifically address flagellate dermatitis, the data suggest an impending transition in the standard of care favoring withdrawal of bleomycin treatment in patients with complications associated with the toxic effects of the drug, especially if they demonstrate favorable initial clinical response to treatment.Cutaneous toxic effects are a common reaction among chemotherapies in general, and bleomycin is associated with a variety of cutaneous manifestations, including inflammatory nodules, plaques, blistering, nail changes, and alopecia.3 Flagellate dermatitis, however, is considered a classic presentation for the toxic effects of bleomycin.4 Paraneoplastic skin involvement related to Hodgkin disease is well documented but typically encompasses nonspecific occurrence of severe pruritus with or without prurigo, acquired ichthyosis, alopecia or other eruptions that do not reflect tumor invasion. Rarely, cutaneous dissemination of malignant cells can cause more skin changes, which classically develop as painless papules, nodules, plaques, and ulcerations, that are histologically comparable to their affected lymph node counterparts and generally portend a poor prognosis.7,8 Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy could be considered as a differential diagnosis because it occurs in the immediate postpartum period; however, variable pruritic papules and plaques are the defining features of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy.9",JAMA Oncology Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,male,534,augmented_binary,"<answer>

Outside computed tomography of the face showed a 3 - cm cystic structure in the superficial aspect of the right parotid gland with associated lymphadenopathy . An outside health care professional had attempted incision and drainage of the area with negative cultures . The patient presented to our clinic with an isolated right 2 - cm fluctuant and tender mass overlying the parotid gland . There was no accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy , and facial nerve function remained fully intact . The patient denied fevers or systemic symptoms . Results of laboratory evaluation revealed normal complete blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels with negative infectious workup results for Epstein - Barr virus , cytomegalovirus , HIV , and tuberculosis ( TB ) . Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 1.9 - cm peripherally enhancing , centrally necrotic lesion overlying the superficial right parotid gland with multiple subcentimeter necrotic lymph nodes within the right parotid gland ( Figure 1).The T1 - weighted , contrast - enhanced , and fat - suppressed axial ( A ) and coronal ( B ) magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrate the enhancing right - sided lesions overlying the distal aspect of the parotid and extending deep into the parotid parenchyma .",Branchial cleft cyst,Atypical mycobacterium infection,Chronic sialadenitis with abscess,Venolymphatic malformation,B. Atypical mycobacterium infection,B,Atypical mycobacterium infection,"Shortly after his presentation to our clinic, the patient developed violaceous skin changes with purulent drainage, which appeared consistent with atypical mycobacterial or nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection (Figure 2). He subsequently underwent drainage and curettage. Histopathologic examination revealed acute chronic inflammation with negative cultures. The infectious disease service started antibiotics for NTM, but they were stopped owing to an adverse reaction. The patient remained asymptomatic for 10 months but had a recurrence in the same area with extension into the parotid gland without involvement of the masseter. He subsequently underwent wide local excision. Cultures returned positive for Mycobacterium abscessus.Right preauricular cutaneous lesion demonstrating the violaceous hue.The differential diagnosis of this condition should include mycobacterium TB adenitis, viral lymphadenitis, hematologic cancer, aerobic abscess, and bartonella henselae.1 While a branchial cleft cyst and chronic sialadenitis with abscess could present similarly, the skin changes and indolent course without systemic symptoms are more suggestive of an NTM. Magnetic resonance imaging showing a necrotic lesion with associated lymphadenopathy is not suggestive of a lymphovascular malformation.An NTM infection can prove to be a diagnostic challenge, especially when the characteristic skin changes are absent and cultures are negative. The typical age of presentation is 1 to 5 years old, with an incidence of 0.77 to 1.3 in 100 000 children.2-5 Hundreds of species exist, but Mycobacterium avium complex is most commonly implicated in lymphadenitis.5 These bacteria are believed to have primarily environmental (soil or water) origins.6 In children, this most commonly involves submandibular or cervical nodes and, less frequently, the preauricular, sublingual, and parotid lymph nodes.1-3,7When suspecting NTM, it is important to rule out TB adenitis because it has a considerably different treatment paradigm.5 Tuberculosis typically has more systemic symptoms, whereas NTM lymphadenitis commonly presents as local erythema and fluctuance without substantial tenderness, which can progress to violaceous skin changes with fistula formation.6 Staining methods include fluorochrome, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Kinyoun, although NTM is visualized in only 30% to 60% of cases.5 Recommendations support performing both solid and broth culture medias, and different species of bacteria require different intubation times (7 days to 12 weeks).5 Polymerase chain reaction testing, when available, tends to have the greatest sensitivity.6 Definitive diagnosis of NTM is with a positive culture, although cultures are only positive in 50% to 82% of specimens, which further adds to the diagnostic difficultly.5Treatment options include observation, antimicrobial agents, surgical procedures, or a combination of any of these.6,7 Antimicrobial therapy alone is associated with a prolonged treatment course with potential adverse effects and a higher rate of recurrence.7 A meta-analysis showed no difference for recurrence rates between antimicrobials vs observation.7 Total surgical excision has demonstrated a cure rate greater than 90% in multiple studies, and as such, current literature supports total surgical excision with or without adjuvant macrolide antimicrobials as the treatment of choice.5-8Special considerations for surgical management of parotid NTM infections include risk of injury to the facial nerve and the psychosocial effect of having a scar on the face.7 In the present case, the patient had fistula formation before surgery; thus, he was already at risk of cosmetic disfiguration from the infected wound even before operating. Of 16 published studies documenting surgical treatment of pediatric parotid NTM infections, in which 59% were total or near total excision, no cases of permanent facial weakness were reported.9 Another study showed a permanent nerve weakness in only 2% of patients undergoing surgery for head and neck NTM.7The present patient was doing well at last follow-up, with full facial function and a well-healing incision. Although NTM of the parotid is an infrequent presentation of a relatively common pediatric infection, it should remain on the differential diagnosis.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,female,198,augmented_binary,"<answer>

At their routine follow - up visit 2 weeks prior , the proliferative diabetic retinopathy was quiescent , and their Snellen visual acuity was 20/20 OD with manifest refraction of −1.50   +   0.25   ×   180 .

Anterior segment OCT confirmed the diagnosis. Performing a posterior capsulotomy would allow egress of the turbid material into the vitreous cavity and provide immediate resolution of the refractive change with minimal risk. If this was not successful, we would then perform a posterior capsulotomy during pars plana vitrectomy (choice A). Exchanging the IOL (choice C) is not preferred because decreasing the new lens power to compensate for the myopic shift would result in a hyperopic surprise, as the procedure itself would resolve the capsular bag distention syndrome (CBDS). Observation (choice D) is preferable when the patient does not want intervention; however, the myopic shift needs to be corrected with an updated manifest refraction.Capsular bag distention syndrome, also known as capsular block syndrome, is a rare complication after phacoemulsification and placement of an IOL into the capsular bag.1,2 It is characterized by the accumulation of opaque fluid within the potential space between the posterior aspect of the IOL and the intact posterior capsule. Capsular bag distention syndrome is classified as intraoperative, early-onset, or late-onset on the basis of time of onset.3 Intraoperative CBDS occurs with lens luxation following hydrodissection. Early-onset CBDS is associated with retained viscoelastic materials. Late-onset CBDS is caused by residual cortical cells secreting alpha-crystallin proteins, which creates a turbid milieu that slowly accumulates and distends the posterior capsule.4 Patients with diabetes are not at increased risk for this syndrome. Although intraoperative and early-onset forms of CBDS are often associated with high intraocular pressure and shallowing of the anterior chamber, these features may be absent in the late-onset form.5 This patient presented with late-onset CBDS, demonstrating symptomatic visual acuity decline approximately 4 years after cataract surgery.Although CBDS can be diagnosed clinically, the value of using anterior segment OCT has been previously reported.6 The combination of increased refractive index of the turbid milieu along with convex configuration of the hyperdistended capsular bag forms a plus lens effect that causes a myopic shift, as experienced by this patient.Capsular bag distention syndrome can often be treated with Nd:YAG laser–assisted posterior capsulotomy, as this quick in-office procedure evacuates the turbid milieu from the capsular bag and resolves symptoms almost immediately.5,7 When an infectious etiology, in particular Propionibacterium acnes, is suspected, use of pars plana vitrectomy is necessary to surgically remove the contents of the bag, along with possible IOL exchange and/or injection of intraocular antibiotics.8,9 In this patient, there were no clinical findings of intraocular inflammation or capsular plaques to suggest infection.This patient underwent uneventful Nd:YAG laser–assisted posterior capsulotomy of the right eye; 1 hour after the procedure, the intraocular pressure was 11 mm Hg by applanation. Within 10 minutes after the procedure, the patient reported noticeably improved distance vision in the right eye. Repeated manifest refraction showed resolution of the myopic shift.

Nodular fasciitis,D,Nodular fasciitis,"First described in 1955 by Konwaler et al,1 nodular fasciitis is a rapidly growing benign soft-tissue mass characterized by abundant cellularity, rapid growth, and high mitotic activity. Located in either the deep subcutaneous tissues or superficial fascia, nodular fasciitis is a nonneoplastic proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Although the pathological and clinical presentation resembles that of malignant soft-tissue sarcomas, often leading to misdiagnosis, the condition is benign. The etiology of nodular fasciitis is uncertain, with some proposing that it is a reactive process associated with trauma, while others describe it as a self-limiting clonal process with neoplastic origins.2 Originally called pseudosarcomatous fibromatosis, other terms, such as nodular pseudosarcomatous fasciitis, pseudosarcomatous fasciitis, infiltrative fasciitis, or proliferative fasciitis may be used to refer to the same disease process.Nodular fasciitis preferentially affects adults (in 80% of cases), usually within the first 2 to 4 decades of life with a slight male predominance.3 Although rare in children, it can present as a chest wall tumor in children (it constitutes 1.8% of all childhood solid chest wall tumors),4 and should considered as a diagnosis. After surgical excision, local recurrence has been documented but is rare.5Most lesions are subcutaneous and circumscribed, lending them amenable to biopsy or excision. Patients notice a rapidly growing, subcutaneous painless mass over the course of 3 to 6 weeks. Masses are solid, nodular, firm, or rubbery and usually plateau at 2.0 to 3.0 cm, rarely exceeding 4.0 cm. The upper extremities are the most common area of presentation, especially the flexor aspect of the forearm. They are less frequently found on the trunk (20%), head and neck (20%), and lower extremities (13%),3 and may have an associated history of trauma.6 In the head and neck region, lesions are often found on the neck or face and less rarely on the forehead and/or scalp or around the eyes.3Histologically, nodular fasciitis demonstrates nonneoplastic proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, although there is a vast array of presentation pattern. The cellular composition of the mass can further divide nodular fasciitis into 3 subtypes: type 1 (myxoid), type 2 (cellular), and type 3 (fibrotic).6 The subtype of nodular fasciitis diagnosed may be dependent on the duration the lesion has been present, because fibrotic type may represent the most mature and longest-lasting lesions.6Type 1 has fibroblast-like cells within a stroma rich in collagen and/or myxoid ground substance. This type tends to form a large tumor, occurs more frequently in older patients, and appears similar to the myxoid variant of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Type 2 has significantly less ground substance and stroma, with large, plump, fibroblast-like spindle cells that have vesicular nuclei. The high cellular proliferation and mitotic activity most closely resembles sarcomatous lesions. Type 3 most closely resembles other benign lesions and has more spindle-shaped, slender fibroblast-like cells and increased collagen production.6The tumor’s rapid presentation and histological profile closely resembles that of sarcomas, often leading to misdiagnosis. Beyond sarcomas, other pathological processes to consider include neurofibromas, palmer fibromatosis, extra-abdominal desmoid tumors, and early presentation of myositis ossificans if intramuscular.The diagnosis can be confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a probe to the USP6 17p13 locus.7USP6 rearrangements in 10% or greater lesional cells are considered positive with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 100%, respectively. Our patient showed a USP6 rearrangement in 44% of lesional cells, confirming the diagnosis.Imaging with ultrasonography may show ill-defined hypoechoic nodules in the deep or superficial fascial layers, whereas imaging with magnetic resonance imaging showed T1-isointense nodules and T2-hyperintense nodules.8 However, this utility is limited, and fine-needle biopsy or core biopsy may reveal more detailed histological findings. An initial observation period of several weeks may be warranted, especially considering the self-limiting and/or spontaneous regression course of the disease. Steroid injections have also been found to aid lesion regression. However, surgical excision still remains the mainstay treatment of choice.

GM1 gangliosidosis,C,GM1 gangliosidosis,"Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy specimen revealed a slightly hyperpigmented epidermis with a moderate increase in melanocytes on S-100 protein and Melan-A staining. In the dermis, multiple S-100 protein–positive fusiform and dendritic cells were found (Figure, B and C), which were also positive on Fontana-Masson staining. Therefore, the histopathological pattern was consistent with a mongolian spot (nevus fuscoceruleus).However, the kyphosis, coarse facial features, muscular hypotonia, and hepatomegaly were consistent with a lysosomal storage disease. Further investigations revealed a cardiomyopathy (left ventricular hypertrophy and mitral insufficiency), as well as ultrasonographic abnormalities in the brain (voluminous hyperechoic basal ganglia). Fundoscopic examination demonstrated a cherry-red spot on the retina. Spot urine analysis was negative for glycosaminoglycans. A chest radiograph showed paddle-shaped ribs, as well as a triangle-shaped body of the first lumbar vertebra (Figure, D), favoring the diagnosis of a lysosomal storage disease.β-Galactosidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes was also significantly reduced, which is indicative of type I (infantile) GM1 gangliosidosis. Subsequent genetic analysis identified a homozygous mutation in exon 2 of the GLB1 gene (c.176G>A p.R59H) (OMIM 611458), confirming the diagnosis. The OMIM accession number of the phenotype (type I GM1 gangliosidosis) is 230500.Nevi fuscocerulei are benign melanocytic congenital birthmarks with a diameter of 3 to 10 cm. They localize in the lumbosacral region, usually resolve during childhood, and predominate in Asian (ie, mongolian spots), American Indian, and African populations.Widespread mongolian spots can be indicative of inborn errors of metabolism, in particular lysosomal storage diseases. Most frequently, these errors include GM1 gangliosidosis (15 cases reported)1-8 and Hurler-Scheie syndrome, followed by Niemann-Pick disease, Hunter syndrome, and α-mannosidosis.9GM1 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive disease. More than 165 mutations in the GLB1 gene (3p22.3), encoding β-galactosidase, have been described. The missense mutation p.R59H (c.176G>A) is the most common mutation found in European patients with GM1 gangliosidosis.10 Enzyme deficiency results in toxic accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in many tissues. In the most severe form (type I), symptoms become apparent by age 6 months. Patients develop hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disability, loss of vision, distinctive facial features, and gingival hypertrophy. They die within the first 2 to 3 years of life. In type II (onset, 1½ to 5 years), there is delayed motor and cognitive development. Life expectancy is shortened.In the adult form (onset, 3-30 years), patients develop dystonia and vertebral abnormalities. Life expectancy correlates with the level of β-galactosidase activity.GM1, one of the major gangliosides, is known to increase nerve growth factor (NGF) activity, mediated by the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptor. In melanocytes, NGF-activated Trk receptor promotes proliferation and is speculated to inhibit transdermal migration. Therefore, mongolian spots in GM1 gangliosidosis are thought to be caused by arrested transdermal migration of melanocytes from the neural crest into the epidermis, leading to their entrapment and proliferation in the dermis.5,6,8,9Multiple and extensive nevi fuscocerulei merit special attention. In some lysosomal storage diseases (eg, Hurler-Scheie syndrome and Hunter syndrome), early diagnosis allows treatment with recombinant enzyme therapy or stem cell transplantation.

The pregnancy was full - term and uncomplicated , and they was delivered spontaneously without the use of forceps . their corneal abnormalities were noted by the neonatologists on the first day of life . A systemic survey revealed no other dysmorphic findings . they was referred to the clinic for further evaluation and management . Examination under anesthesia revealed bilateral corneal opacities with peripheral clearing and absent red reflexes . The white - to - white corneal diameters were 10 mm horizontally and vertically in both eyes , and B - scan ultrasonography revealed unremarkable posterior segments . Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the diagnosis of Peters anomaly type I with iridocorneal adhesions and no apparent lens involvement . At the same session , a large iridectomy with lysis of iridocorneal adhesions was performed in both eyes to establish a clear , noncentral optical axis . Shallowing of the anterior chamber was observed immediately after the iridectomy . However , the patient ’s corneal opacity precluded an accurate assessment of the chamber depth and stability ( Figure 1).A temporal iridectomy was present , but the anterior chamber depth could not be assessed accurately owing to corneal opacity .

In patients with an incompletely opacified cornea, a clear visual axis can sometimes be established by either optical dilation with pharmacological agents or with an optical sector iridectomy.1-3 The use of sterile air bubble as a space-occupying agent in ophthalmic surgery has largely been replaced by the use of various ophthalmic viscosurgical devices, with indications for sterile air limited to the tamponade of retinal breaks or in support of a graft during endothelial keratoplasty.4,5In this patient, the corneal opacity precluded the adequate assessment of anterior chamber depth and stability during wound closure. A sterile intracameral air bubble allows the visualization of the interface between the bubble and the lens capsule (Figure 2) and thus the assessment of the chamber depth. The shape and size of the bubble footprint make monitoring chamber stability possible: A small, round footprint suggests a deep and stable chamber, whereas a collapsing chamber results in a broadening and ovalization of the bubble footprint. The injection of intracameral sterile air bubble is an easy intraoperative maneuver to gauge chamber stability when the cornea is not sufficiently clear to allow direct assessment.With the injection of a balanced salt solution, the bubble footprint became small and round, suggesting a stable and deep anterior chamber.Applying fibrin glue (choice A) in this case is unnecessary, because there was no evidence that watertight wound closure could not be achieved with suturing. Filling the chamber with an ophthalmic viscosurgical device (choice B) will maintain its depth temporarily, although collapse is still possible during the washout, and retained ophthalmic viscosurgical device will result in intraocular pressure spikes that may damage the remaining clear cornea. Tilting the microscope (choice D) is unlikely to improve the assessment of chamber depth and stability without the use of a slit beam.Approximately 6 months after bilateral optical iridectomy, the patient had bright red reflexes in both eyes and was able to fixate and pursue small fixation targets.

Atrioventricular dissociation was present, indicating complete heart block. Two pacing stimuli were seen bracketing each QRS complex. These are indicated by the ECG machine with inverted triangles along the top of Figure 2. The QRS morphology was typical of left bundle branch block, consistent with right ventricular pacing. The first stimulus did not precede visible P waves, indicating atrial noncapture; however, this stimulus did result in ventricular depolarization (capture). The second pacing stimulus did not result in either atrial or ventricular capture, which is likely explained by delivery of the pacing stimulus during the ventricular myocardial refractory period. Based on this pattern and the duration between the stimuli (about 180 milliseconds), atrial lead dislodgment with ventricular capture by the atrial lead was the leading differential diagnosis. Lead reversal at the pulse generator could not be excluded using only the surface ECG but was implausible in this case because the postimplantation ECG showed a normal atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm. Additionally, if this patient experienced lead reversal, it would be expected for P waves to be seen following the second pacing stimulus. It is also possible that a second pacing stimulus would not be delivered if the ventricular lead were to sense the atrial stimulus (ie, crosstalk) or, in the case of intact ventriculoatrial conduction, a retrograde P wave.A, Representative leads from presenting electrocardiogram annotated to highlight pacemaker stimuli. B and C, Posteroanterior (B) and lateral (C) chest radiographs demonstrating right atrial lead dislodgment. The right atrial lead has migrated to the right ventricular apex (yellow arrowheads), while the right ventricular lead appears to be affixed to the right ventricular septum (black arrowheads).Chest radiographs (choice C) are the most expeditious means by which to evaluate suspected lead migration. Posteroanterior and lateral films were obtained (Figure 2), confirming right atrial lead dislodgment with migration to the right ventricular apex. The patient was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic, and thus neither transcutaneous pacing (choice B) nor transvenous pacing (choice A) were indicated.1 Medical therapy for bradycardia (eg, atropine) would also not be indicated in absence of symptoms or hemodynamic derangement.1 Placement of a magnet (choice D) would result in asynchronous pacing at the magnet rate.2 This would not be unreasonable, but in this case, this would result in the same pacemaker-stimulus-bracketed QRS pattern but at a higher rate.In this case, the chest radiograph was essential. It would be possible, albeit more challenging, to use the pacemaker itself to differentiate between lead reversal at the pulse generator and lead migration. One strategy would be to reprogram the device to the ventricular demand pacing (VVI) mode of function, which would eliminate atrial pacing output. The first pacing stimulus would then not occur, and stimuli delivered at the right ventricular lead would continue to result in ventricular depolarization. If the atrial demand–inhibited (AAI) mode of function were programmed, the second pacing stimulus would not be delivered and the dislodged atrial stimuli would result in continued ventricular depolarization. With lead reversal, in contrast, programming VVI mode would result in atrial depolarization by stimuli delivered from the ventricular lead, while AAI mode would result in ventricular depolarization by stimuli delivered through the atrial lead. Since VVI pacing would result in only atrial depolarization, it is important to remember that this maneuver could produce ventricular asystole in the setting of absence of atrioventricular conduction.The patient underwent right atrial lead repositioning under fluoroscopic guidance. An ECG obtained after the procedure revealed atrial-ventricular dual-paced rhythm with occasional atrial inhibition by native complexes at a rate of 61 beats per minute, indicating appropriate positions of the atrial and ventricular leads.",JAMA Cardiology Clinical Challenge ,What Would You Do Next?,non-binary,368,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

Patients often undergo topical chemotherapy after surgical intervention with mitomycin C.Given this patient’s history of an extensive conjunctival melanoma requiring a large dissection and excision, it was necessary to evaluate the new peaked pupil with ultrasonographic biomicroscopy (UBM). Continuing or delaying mitomycin C therapy would not assess the etiology of the peaked pupil. A biopsy of the area would represent an overly aggressive intervention, having not completed the diagnostic UBM testing first.Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy would evaluate the ciliary body to exclude the possibility of intraocular extension, with the tumor potentially pushing forward and inducing focal peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS). The incidence of conjunctival melanoma with intraocular extension is extremely rare, but has been reported by multiple groups. One report2 describes an association between intraocular extension of conjunctival melanoma and a limbal location, with intraocular invasion likely because of breach of the Bowman membrane. Another report1 describes a patient who had a large recurrent conjunctival melanoma after undergoing multiple excisions who also had a history of penetrating keratoplasty; the melanoma had invaded the ciliary body, trabecular meshwork, and iris. Another case3 described intraocular extension several years after trabeculectomy surgery. One similarity shared among these cases was the need for multiple surgical procedures for a complete tumor excision, as well as a history of penetrating intraocular surgery, suggesting an iatrogenic role for intraocular spread. Notably, the inverse clinical presentation has been previously reported as well in a rare case of primary uveal melanoma metastasizing to the conjunctiva.4 In this case, no intraocular surgery had been completed before or after the melanoma resection.Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy results of the suspicious area showed no ciliary body tumor extension, but rather a focal PAS formation (Figure 2). The PAS noted on gonioscopy that caused the peaked pupil was attributed to inflammatory cicatricial changes from multiple applications of cryotherapy to the limbus. This finding has been observed among several patients with ocular surface squamous neoplasia and melanoma who were treated with cryotherapy. We have also observed microhyphemas on the first postoperative day in rare occasions.

Multicentric Castleman disease,B,Multicentric Castleman disease,"A microscopic analysis of the biopsy revealed focal concentric mantle cell zone architecture (or onion-skin morphology; Figure). Further, the capsule was noted to be focally thickened, with the presence of vascular proliferation in addition to substantial intermedullary plasmacytosis. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated human herpes virus–8 (HHV8) positivity in the spindle cells in areas of vascular proliferation (diagnostic of Kaposi sarcoma; Figure) and the round large lymphoid cells in the follicles (diagnostic of coexisting multicentric Castleman disease [MCD]).1 A peripheral blood sample also demonstrated HHV8 positivity, and a diagnosis of MCD was made. There were no granulomas or necrosis seen, making granulomatous diseases, including tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, unlikely. Moreover, the preserved nodal architecture was not consistent with lymphoma.Castleman disease (CD) was first described in the mid-1950s and is currently regarded as a group of at least 4 disorders with a wide range of presentations and overlapping histopathologic patterns.2 Multicentric CD represents a subcategory of CD that involves lymphadenopathy across multiple lymph node stations in which a morphological triad has been described that comprises (1) diffuse marked plasmacytosis, (2) prominent germinal centers that often have hyaline vascular changes, and (3) preserved nodal architecture.3 In particular, HHV8-associated MCD (HHV8-MCD) comprises most MCD cases.1 Its pathogenesis is associated with uncontrolled HHV8 infection and thought to involve viral infection of B cells and plasmablasts with dysregulation of cytokines and a resultant increase in IL-6 that then is followed by the symptoms, signs, and lymph node pathology associated with this condition.4 Human herpes virus 8 MCD is most commonly seen in HIV-positive patients, although HHV8-MCD has also been reported in HIV-negative patients.3 Human herpes virus 8 MCD tends to present during the seventh decade of life in HIV-negative patients (as opposed to the fifth decade in HIV-positive patients), and includes systemic signs and symptoms, including fevers, night sweats, fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly, and liver and kidney dysfunction.2 Diagnosis is established by testing for HHV8 in the biopsied lymph node tissue or circulation in a patient with multicentric lymphadenopathy with the previously noted CD histopathological features.2 Notably, HHV8-MCD not only confers an elevated risk of Kaposi sarcoma (in up to 50% of cases) but also large B-cell and primary effusion lymphomas (about 15%).1Unlike unicentric CD, which involves lymphadenopathy in a single nodal station and for which complete surgical excision is usually curative, MCD has a poorer prognosis and requires systemic treatment.1 The mainstay of systemic therapy for HHV8-MCD involves rituximab-based (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) approaches, which have improved overall survival for this patient population from 33% to 90%, with many achieving clinical remission.2 Although most of the case series have examined HHV8-MCD in HIV-positive patients,5 rituximab-based therapies with or without treatment with etoposide have also demonstrated success in HIV-negative patients.2,6,7 While to our knowledge there are currently no consensus guidelines on HHV8-MCD treatment in HIV-negative patients, many experts recommend an individualized approach and treatment based on duration of symptoms and trends in the relevant inflammatory markers.This patient ultimately received a diagnosis of HHV8-MCD and was connected with a hematology-oncology specialist for further treatment. Rituximab-based therapy was offered as a treatment option in addition to referral to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease for further assessment. This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis, including Castleman disease, in the workup of cervical lymphadenopathy in elderly patients. In particular, cervical lymphadenopathy is a common presenting problem for which referrals are commonly made to otolaryngologists for further evaluation and possible surgical excision. It also underscores the importance of prompt referral to a hematology-oncology expert given the potentially treatable nature of this disease, in addition to the elevated risk for secondary cancer.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,non-binary,156,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

Retinoblastoma must be ruled out in any child with leukocoria or a posterior segment mass. An examination under anesthesia (choice B) is needed for a scleral depressed examination, ultrasonography (because a calcified retinal tumor is pathognomonic), and MRI with contrast to assess the eyes, optic nerves, orbits, and brain. A uveitis workup (choice A) is inappropriate because the patient had no intraocular inflammation, and this approach does not further investigate the mass. Imaging for tuberous sclerosis (choice C) is not indicated, because the lesion is more concerning for retinoblastoma than astrocytic hamartoma, which in young patients usually presents with gray-white or translucent, noncalcified retinal lesions. Clinical observation (choice D) is inappropriate for a potentially neoplastic posterior segment mass.During the examination under anesthesia, B-scan ultrasonography showed a single intraretinal lesion (basal dimensions, 5 × 12 mm; thickness, 1 mm) with trace calcification without extraocular extension. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the intraretinal tumor location (Figure 2). The MRI had results notable for a plaquelike lesion along the posterior-medial right globe without enhancement. The patient was diagnosed with unilateral group B retinoblastoma (per the International Intraocular Classification of Retinoblastoma). The tumor was successfully treated with focal laser consolidation monthly, 3 times, under anesthesia.Optical coherence tomography from the patient’s examination showing the intraretinal tumor.Germline retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB1) testing from saliva revealed a variant in exon 20 (c.1978_1996del, p.Leu660Valfs*11), resulting in a premature stop codon and disrupted protein. This variant is not included in the Genome Aggregation Database and has not been reported in RB1-associated disease. The variant was detected in 14% of the 337 sequencing reads, suggesting mosaicism, which means that the sequence variation occurred after conception and is present in only a subset of the patient’s cells.1 Subsequent lymphocyte DNA sequencing confirmed the same sequence variation in 50% of the sequencing reads, further supporting mosaicism. Recent studies demonstrated mosaicism in retinoblastoma is more common than previously recognized.2-5 Since it is unknown what proportion of retinal cells and other tissues harbor the sequence variation, the patient must be screened and her family counseled that a patient with germline RB1 sequence variation is at risk for new ocular tumors, retinoblastoma-associated malignant conditions, and potential transmission of the RB1 sequence variation to her future children.Retinoblastoma can present with unilateral, bilateral, or trilateral (tumors in both eyes and a pineal or suprasellar tumor) disease. Patients with somatic variants of both RB1 alleles in a retinal cell present with unilateral disease and do not carry a pathogenic RB1 variant in every cell (they are germline negative). Germline RB1 variants are associated with bilateral disease (although 10%-15% of patients with this pathogenic variant have unilateral disease), and patients are at risk for additional ocular tumors and trilateral retinoblastoma. Approximately 2% of retinoblastomas do not harbor RB1 alterations and instead are driven by high-level N-myc (MYCN) oncogene amplification.6The family elected laser therapy. However, we discussed the possibility that the lesion may be a retinocytoma, a rare, benign retinoblastoma variant often associated with calcification, retinal pigment epithelial disturbance, chorioretinal atrophy, and absence of growth.7,8 Retinocytomas, which result from RB1 sequence variations, carry an approximate 5% risk of malignant transformation7 and require close observation and treatment for any growth or change.8",JAMA Ophthalmology Clinical Challenge ,"The retinal mass is denoted with arrowheads.Initiate a uveitis workup for infectious and inflammatory conditionsPlan an urgent examination under anesthesia, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)Obtain chest and abdomen MRI to evaluate for cardiac rhabdomyoma and kidney cysts or tumors associated with neurocutaneous syndromes What Would You Do Next?",non-binary,323,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

At 3 weeks ’ postpartum , they began chemotherapy ( cycle 1 , day 1 ) with adriamycin , bleomycin , vinblastine , and dacarbazine ( ABVD ) . On day 15 of cycle 1 , they presented with linear , hyperpigmented streaks and welts on their arms , back , and legs . Intense , diffuse pruritus had developed within 24 hours of the patient ’s first day of treatment , and their symptoms were poorly responsive to antihistamines and topical steroids . Pruritus was followed by the appearance of dark scratch marks as demonstrated in the Figure . Laboratory test results revealed a white blood cell count of 1.6 ×103 cells / mm3 , with an absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells / mm3 and a total bilirubin of 0.3 mg / dL ( to convert to μmol / L , multiply by 17.104 ) , which was unchanged from the baseline total bilirubin . Clinical photograph of the patient ’s back shows scratch marks that appeared after diffuse pruritus . Prior to the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma , they was receiving routine prenatal care , and the only complication was pruritus without a rash that developed during the first trimester . they was evaluated for right supraclavicular adenopathy that was unresponsive to antibiotics during the third trimester . Findings from a lymph node biopsy were consistent with classic Hodgkin lymphoma , nodular sclerosis subtype . Staging imaging revealed bilateral supraclavicular jugular chain , paratracheal and mediastinal lymphadenopathy , and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 67 mm / h. they was diagnosed with stage II , unfavorable - risk Hodgkin lymphoma .",Bleomycin toxic effects,Paraneoplastic skin disease,Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy,Vinblastine toxic effects,A. Bleomycin toxic effects,A,Bleomycin toxic effects,"This patient developed bleomycin flagellate dermatitis, a cutaneous reaction to bleomycin characterized by the appearance of pruritic, whiplike streaks of hyperpigmentation, predominantly affecting the trunk and extremities. Bleomycin is a sulfur-containing, antineoplastic agent that blocks the G2 phase of the cell cycle through inhibition of thymidine integration into replicating DNA, degradation of single- and double-stranded DNA, and cleavage of cellular RNA.1 Bleomycin distributes widely throughout the body and is inactivated in every organ except the skin and lungs owing to the absence of the hydrolase enzyme responsible for the drug’s metabolism.2 Absence of this enzyme permits drug accumulation, which can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and various adverse cutaneous manifestations associated with bleomycin.1Flagellate dermatitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis because there are no pathognomonic histologic features. Early histologic findings are consistent with a fixed-drug reaction, and in later stages, reflect a postinflammatory reaction.3 Time of onset varies, occurring within hours or up to 9 weeks following exposure, and the reported incidence of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis is between 8% and 22%.4 Symptoms are generally well controlled with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and withdrawal of bleomycin. Early descriptions of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis documented an apparent dose-dependent occurrence in 8% to 66% of patients; however, the flagellate exanthem has since been reported with bleomycin doses as low as 5 mg with no predictable patient demographic.2-4 Nonetheless, Ziemer et al4 observed in a meta-analysis that women receiving bleomycin specifically for lymphoproliferative disorders might be most susceptible to developing acute-onset flagellate dermatitis at lower doses of exposure.This patient initially discontinued bleomycin for 1 cycle, but she tolerated successful reintroduction of bleomycin with an adjuvant steroid regimen. She remained in remission more than 2 years after chemotherapy completion and had no evidence of bleomycin pulmonary toxic effects. Until recently, there have been no definitive guidelines regarding whether to withdraw bleomycin or rechallenge following an eruption of flagellate dermatitis. The Response Adapted Therapy for Advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma (RATHL) trial randomized patients with negative findings on positron-emission tomography after 2 cycles of ABVD to continue ABVD or deescalate treatment to adriamycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD).5 The absolute difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate between the 2 groups was 1.6% (95% CI, −3.2% to 5.3%) and there was a lower incidence of pulmonary toxic effects when bleomycin was omitted.5 Another important phase 3 clinical trial (ECHELON-1)6 compared brentuximab vedotin plus AVD (A+AVD) with standard ABVD in previously untreated patients with stage III or IV Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin plus AVD was superior, with a 4.9% lower combined risk of disease progression, death, or incomplete disease response at 2 years, and pulmonary toxic effects were documented in less than 1% of patients receiving A+AVD compared with 3% in those receiving ABVD.6 Although these studies do not specifically address flagellate dermatitis, the data suggest an impending transition in the standard of care favoring withdrawal of bleomycin treatment in patients with complications associated with the toxic effects of the drug, especially if they demonstrate favorable initial clinical response to treatment.Cutaneous toxic effects are a common reaction among chemotherapies in general, and bleomycin is associated with a variety of cutaneous manifestations, including inflammatory nodules, plaques, blistering, nail changes, and alopecia.3 Flagellate dermatitis, however, is considered a classic presentation for the toxic effects of bleomycin.4 Paraneoplastic skin involvement related to Hodgkin disease is well documented but typically encompasses nonspecific occurrence of severe pruritus with or without prurigo, acquired ichthyosis, alopecia or other eruptions that do not reflect tumor invasion. Rarely, cutaneous dissemination of malignant cells can cause more skin changes, which classically develop as painless papules, nodules, plaques, and ulcerations, that are histologically comparable to their affected lymph node counterparts and generally portend a poor prognosis.7,8 Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy could be considered as a differential diagnosis because it occurs in the immediate postpartum period; however, variable pruritic papules and plaques are the defining features of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy.9",JAMA Oncology Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,non-binary,534,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>

I've chosen option B because the patient is presenting with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has a history of recurrent UTIs. Nitrofurantoin is a commonly used antibiotic for UTIs and has a high efficacy rate. Additionally, it has a low risk of adverse effects and is safe for use in pregnancy, which is important given the patient's current status.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2787788,"A previously healthy 8 - year - old child presented to an outpatient clinic for further evaluation of a fluctuating right parotid mass that had been present for 3 years . The patient was not immunocompromised and denied any trauma to the area . In the 2 months prior , they had received multiple rounds of antibiotics from other health care professionals . Outside computed tomography of the face showed a 3 - cm cystic structure in the superficial aspect of the right parotid gland with associated lymphadenopathy . An outside health care professional had attempted incision and drainage of the area with negative cultures . The patient presented to our clinic with an isolated right 2 - cm fluctuant and tender mass overlying the parotid gland . There was no accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy , and facial nerve function remained fully intact . The patient denied fevers or systemic symptoms . Results of laboratory evaluation revealed normal complete blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels with negative infectious workup results for Epstein - Barr virus , cytomegalovirus , HIV , and tuberculosis ( TB ) . Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 1.9 - cm peripherally enhancing , centrally necrotic lesion overlying the superficial right parotid gland with multiple subcentimeter necrotic lymph nodes within the right parotid gland ( Figure 1).The T1 - weighted , contrast - enhanced , and fat - suppressed axial ( A ) and coronal ( B ) magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrate the enhancing right - sided lesions overlying the distal aspect of the parotid and extending deep into the parotid parenchyma .",Branchial cleft cyst,Atypical mycobacterium infection,Chronic sialadenitis with abscess,Venolymphatic malformation,B. Atypical mycobacterium infection,B,Atypical mycobacterium infection,"Shortly after his presentation to our clinic, the patient developed violaceous skin changes with purulent drainage, which appeared consistent with atypical mycobacterial or nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection (Figure 2). He subsequently underwent drainage and curettage. Histopathologic examination revealed acute chronic inflammation with negative cultures. The infectious disease service started antibiotics for NTM, but they were stopped owing to an adverse reaction. The patient remained asymptomatic for 10 months but had a recurrence in the same area with extension into the parotid gland without involvement of the masseter. He subsequently underwent wide local excision. Cultures returned positive for Mycobacterium abscessus.Right preauricular cutaneous lesion demonstrating the violaceous hue.The differential diagnosis of this condition should include mycobacterium TB adenitis, viral lymphadenitis, hematologic cancer, aerobic abscess, and bartonella henselae.1 While a branchial cleft cyst and chronic sialadenitis with abscess could present similarly, the skin changes and indolent course without systemic symptoms are more suggestive of an NTM. Magnetic resonance imaging showing a necrotic lesion with associated lymphadenopathy is not suggestive of a lymphovascular malformation.An NTM infection can prove to be a diagnostic challenge, especially when the characteristic skin changes are absent and cultures are negative. The typical age of presentation is 1 to 5 years old, with an incidence of 0.77 to 1.3 in 100 000 children.2-5 Hundreds of species exist, but Mycobacterium avium complex is most commonly implicated in lymphadenitis.5 These bacteria are believed to have primarily environmental (soil or water) origins.6 In children, this most commonly involves submandibular or cervical nodes and, less frequently, the preauricular, sublingual, and parotid lymph nodes.1-3,7When suspecting NTM, it is important to rule out TB adenitis because it has a considerably different treatment paradigm.5 Tuberculosis typically has more systemic symptoms, whereas NTM lymphadenitis commonly presents as local erythema and fluctuance without substantial tenderness, which can progress to violaceous skin changes with fistula formation.6 Staining methods include fluorochrome, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Kinyoun, although NTM is visualized in only 30% to 60% of cases.5 Recommendations support performing both solid and broth culture medias, and different species of bacteria require different intubation times (7 days to 12 weeks).5 Polymerase chain reaction testing, when available, tends to have the greatest sensitivity.6 Definitive diagnosis of NTM is with a positive culture, although cultures are only positive in 50% to 82% of specimens, which further adds to the diagnostic difficultly.5Treatment options include observation, antimicrobial agents, surgical procedures, or a combination of any of these.6,7 Antimicrobial therapy alone is associated with a prolonged treatment course with potential adverse effects and a higher rate of recurrence.7 A meta-analysis showed no difference for recurrence rates between antimicrobials vs observation.7 Total surgical excision has demonstrated a cure rate greater than 90% in multiple studies, and as such, current literature supports total surgical excision with or without adjuvant macrolide antimicrobials as the treatment of choice.5-8Special considerations for surgical management of parotid NTM infections include risk of injury to the facial nerve and the psychosocial effect of having a scar on the face.7 In the present case, the patient had fistula formation before surgery; thus, he was already at risk of cosmetic disfiguration from the infected wound even before operating. Of 16 published studies documenting surgical treatment of pediatric parotid NTM infections, in which 59% were total or near total excision, no cases of permanent facial weakness were reported.9 Another study showed a permanent nerve weakness in only 2% of patients undergoing surgery for head and neck NTM.7The present patient was doing well at last follow-up, with full facial function and a well-healing incision. Although NTM of the parotid is an infrequent presentation of a relatively common pediatric infection, it should remain on the differential diagnosis.",Clinical Challenge ,What Is Your Diagnosis?,non-binary,198,augmented_nonbinary,"<answer>
